1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,890
Uh,
hi Jordan.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,100
Uh,
and what x number of a producer with the

3
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:05,934
agenda,
Steve in the TVO and you are Jordan 

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,823
Peterson,
professor of psychology at the 

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,800
University of Toronto.
And this is our third conversation about

6
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:21,090
various subjects.
And this one we decided there's going to

7
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:21,840
be,
uh,

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,340
about,
about the future,

9
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:28,360
the idea of it and then perhaps even the
actuality,

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,370
uh,
the reason why,

11
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:31,500
why,
uh,

12
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,343
the future is the subjects because you 
and I have talked much about it and let 

13
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:37,920
me start with my own,
uh,

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,660
uh,
brief take on it.

15
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,523
Um,
my sense is that we are running out of 

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,220
future with capital apps.
Uh,

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,000
for about 10 years.
Uh,

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,170
we had,
uh,

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,590
uh,
the um,

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,820
uh,
the I and access to,

21
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,330
to the idea of future as an ever 
growing,

22
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:03,331
ever improving a prospect for humanity 
and a,

23
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:08,421
and we are at the point where we no 
longer have easy access to that belief.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,300
Um,
do you agree?

25
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:15,910
And if so,
what do you think is responsible for it?

26
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,973
Well,
it seems to me like it's a continuation 

27
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:20,874
of the process that needs to talk about 
in the late 18 hundreds when he 

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,770
described the death of God.

29
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,700
Yeah.

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,530
I mean he,
by the death of God,

31
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,503
he man really the collapse of 
Christianity or maybe of Judeo 

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,993
Christianity and the loss of the meeting
structure that went along with that at 

33
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,344
the same time as he proclaimed that 
itchy also hypothesized or prophecy 

34
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:46,670
really that,
that,

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,993
that,
that belief system would be replaced by 

36
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:50,344
is that vast political belief systems.
He thought co I've communism 

37
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:57,740
particularly and,
and he knew that even at that early time

38
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:58,574
that many millions of people would die 
during the transition and meaning 

39
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:04,850
systems and now that we're out of the 
20th century,

40
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,303
those of collapse too mean very few 
people hold any brief with Utopian 

41
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:13,574
political views,
whether they're on the right or the 

42
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,000
left.
So we've also lost that.

43
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,843
Then the question is,
what's left after that and announced 

44
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,520
that seems to be,
it's anybody's guess.

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,710
I think we're also swamped by 
technological change that's occurring at

46
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:33,580
such a rate that it's become impossible 
to predict the direction of the future.

47
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,900
So,
but obviously when,

48
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:40,000
when we talk about the future,
we imagined a moral enhancement,

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,350
uh,
of,

50
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:43,010
of the human condition.
Uh,

51
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,530
we imagined that a progress man,
not only technological progress,

52
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:50,860
not only economic progress,
but moral progress.

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,440
Um,
and,

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,393
uh,
and the question is whether or not this 

55
00:02:57,081 --> 00:03:00,640
was adler a,
a viable

56
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,503
prospect.
I wasn't just a watered down 

57
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:04,730
Christianity,
uh,

58
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,420
for the benefit of those,
uh,

59
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,623
who've lost faith niches.
Primary point with the death of God was 

60
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:17,950
that you can't have moral improvement 
without a moral system because you know,

61
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,890
people think there are things that are 
self evidently moral,

62
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,370
but you know,
it turns out that they're part of a much

63
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,110
broader fabric.
So yes,

64
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:28,210
I would say to some degree it was,
it was,

65
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,044
uh,
the remnants of water down Christianity 

66
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,780
playing itself out.
And the question,

67
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,970
I suppose to some degree is what's after
that?

68
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:38,060
And you know,
the,

69
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:38,894
the atheists,
especially the radical atheists would 

70
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:41,950
have us believe that,
you know,

71
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:42,784
we could move towards a kind of rational
sense of the world along with whatever 

72
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,740
rational ethic would go along with that.
But I don't really believe that.

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,353
I don't think there's much reason to 
believe that people will become more 

74
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,230
rational as the future progresses.

75
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,680
I mean,
I think they might become more diverse.

76
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:02,230
Lee Irrational.
That's kind of how it looks to me.

77
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,540
What do you mean by that?
That nervously rational,

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,633
he diversely irrational,
splintered into their own little 

79
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:11,680
subgroups of meaning,
I suppose.

80
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,053
I mean,
why would we assume that people would 

81
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:18,550
become more homogenous?
Homogenous when in their,

82
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,010
in their private,
in their private beliefs.

83
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,903
I mean,
the rise of all these strange new age 

84
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:24,620
religions,
which you know,

85
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,473
we'll have collected any number of Dave 
ots seems to indicate that there's 

86
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:29,614
plenty of room on the irrational side 
and mean Islamic fundamentalism 

87
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:36,610
certainly hasn't managed Jenny 
disappearance.

88
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,990
Maybe you could think of that as the 
last great hangover of the,

89
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,180
of the Abrahamic religions.
You know,

90
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:43,990
that,
that'll,

91
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,823
that'll,
that's under attack and will disappear 

92
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,314
too.
But I don't see that people are 

93
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:52,960
progressing towards the kind of 
rationality that the atheists would like

94
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:55,630
to presume as are our natural 
destination.

95
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,003
Just I just don't think people are that 
rational or capable of that degree of 

96
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:01,690
rationality.
Why?

97
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,410
What's the argument for that?
Well,

98
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,990
I think it's the incompleteness of 
rationality.

99
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:09,670
Personally,
I don't think,

100
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,220
I don't think rationality can survive on
its own.

101
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:15,340
I think it's,
it's like the capitalist system.

102
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,430
It has to be embedded within a 
functioning government.

103
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,490
No matter what the capitalists claim,
the market isn't the bottom governmental

104
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:24,670
agreements,
the bottom,

105
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:25,504
the ultimate container and rationality 
has to survive within a mythology and 

106
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:30,694
the rational is don't believe that.
But I think that that's just because 

107
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:34,900
they're still protected by the 
mythology.

108
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,380
They can get away with that clint 
rationality.

109
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,300
Once you,
once you agree on the presuppositions,

110
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,030
then rationality can guide you to a 
destination.

111
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:46,864
But I don't see how rationality can help
you establish the presuppositions at 

112
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,940
all.
What's more important?

113
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:56,770
Curing cancer or stopping stopping the 
whale hunt?

114
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,580
Let's,
let's look at it that way.

115
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,503
What's more important?
Putting money into education or for 

116
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,550
sure,
or healthcare.

117
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,660
There's these terrible moral decisions 
about

118
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,633
which normally,
normally we don't need to decide either 

119
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:13,871
or.
I mean,

120
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:18,300
normally in the course of human affairs 
we decide that,

121
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:20,490
uh,
we will throw certain amount,

122
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:21,580
uh,
for this,

123
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,443
uh,
goal and another amount for another 

124
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:24,691
goal.
And,

125
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:25,680
and so,
and the,

126
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,300
and the amounts might shift,
might shift.

127
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,610
It's never a question or so.
So,

128
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,690
so the question of I think,
I think I would,

129
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,793
people who are watching this might 
really want to understand what it is 

130
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,550
that you mean by presuppositions.
Uh,

131
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,040
that said that that needs to be 
embedded.

132
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,200
Uh,
before we can talk about the reason

133
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,663
a functioning belief system helps you 
figure out what things are more 

134
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:59,580
important than what other things.
And you know,

135
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,160
those are,
those are,

136
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,370
I suppose the 10 commandments would be 
an example of that.

137
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,773
Are there things that are supposed to be
established without question and you 

138
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:10,874
know,
you might think some of them are 

139
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,074
obvious.
People say that about the 10 

140
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:15,020
commandments,
thou shalt not kill.

141
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,250
That's obvious.
It's like,

142
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,173
well,
it turns out that that's not so obvious 

143
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:21,470
at all.
It's obvious because it's,

144
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,250
it's such an inherent part of our,
the fabric of our society.

145
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,084
And we assume that it's wrong,
but there's been lots of societies that 

146
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,150
have been organized around the 
principles of the warriors societies,

147
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,460
for example.
And we're already,

148
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,310
we're already discussing exceptions to 
the rule.

149
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:38,810
Thou shalt not kill.
I mean,

150
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,500
that didn't that happen in Quebec this 
week,

151
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,120
isn't Quebec debating?

152
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,400
I use Neisha bill.
Uh,

153
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,693
yes,
it is.

154
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,890
Well,
so,

155
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,093
you know,
obviously even something as obvious as 

156
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:56,490
thou shalt not kill can be nibbled to 
death around the,

157
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,890
around the margins.
It's not obvious.

158
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,560
And these,
these belief systems,

159
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
the Judeo Christian belief system,
for example,

160
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,390
and this again is something that needs 
to point it out,

161
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:10,200
is it's whole cloth.
You can't unravel part of it without the

162
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,034
rest of it unraveling.
So one of the precept positions is that 

163
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,690
there's a judge.
That's God.

164
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,930
Something's watching you and your 
ultimate response,

165
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,420
ultimately responsible for your moral 
actions.

166
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,670
That's a big precept position,
you know,

167
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,060
and that's gone.

168
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,570
Yes,
it's gone for a significant minority.

169
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:37,361
Uh,
most,

170
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:41,590
uh,
most of the a 7 billion people,

171
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,443
uh,
like,

172
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,240
uh,
do partake of some kind of a faith.

173
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,693
Right.

174
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,070
But still have the notion of the future 
though too.

175
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:51,540
Whoa.
There,

176
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,460
you know,
like there's plenty of idea of future in

177
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:57,870
the developing the few times to catch up
to the west.

178
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,870
Well,
yes,

179
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,900
but,
but they're there the in some ways,

180
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:05,930
but what we are,
what we are discovering is that the real

181
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:07,250
driver,
uh,

182
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,740
uh,
of,

183
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:13,250
uh,
believe in future is not as not a desire

184
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:15,170
for heightened morality,
uh,

185
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,600
or,
or universal morality.

186
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:18,260
But,
uh,

187
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:23,260
but the poverty and the poverty is what 
makes people want to improve their lot.

188
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,000
Great.
Well,

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,200
there's no doubt that the western 
countries in some sense,

190
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:31,034
solve the problem of poverty and we 
still have the problem of relative 

191
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:35,870
poverty.
I mean,

192
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,030
but the,
the,

193
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,080
the material wealth that we have seems 
to be preferable to absolute poverty.

194
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,110
And so that means that the,
the drive for progress that,

195
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,720
that drove the West is still alive and 
well in the developing countries.

196
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,823
It's thriving too,
because those countries are in fact 

197
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:56,300
lifting themselves out of poverty.
Now,

198
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:57,134
whether or not to us,

199
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,590
but they already know that,
that uh,

200
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,620
that if they will proceed along the path
that we've already walked,

201
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,410
uh,
in the last a hundred,

202
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,350
hundred 50 years,
uh,

203
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,253
they will catch up with us and with our 
kinds of problems and with our kinds of 

204
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:19,830
questions about where to go next.
And so,

205
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:23,670
and so here he will return to the 
question about,

206
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,950
about the future.
Do we,

207
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:31,190
do we need I an idea about how the story
ends for be able to,

208
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,950
to live it properly?

209
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,010
Well,
I was in New York on Friday with a group

210
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:43,900
called future earths and that's,
they're a group that was composed of,

211
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,203
let me just see here,
two major international science 

212
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:54,810
consortium's natural science and social 
science.

213
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:55,644
And that's exactly the sort of argument 
or other sort of the questions they're 

214
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,973
trying to address.
And the UN just produced a report on 

215
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:02,574
sustainable development,
which is a document that is trying to 

216
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:08,420
address that question as well.
What are we looking at?

217
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,260
Those documents tend to stress limits to
growth,

218
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:13,760
at least to some degree.
You know,

219
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,623
they're,
they're,

220
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,553
they're based on the presupposition that
we're running up against planetary 

221
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:21,710
boundaries in our search for increasing 
absolute wealth.

222
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,670
And that we have to figure out a way of 
structuring our future so that it can be

223
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:33,910
sustainable across some longterm.
So the idea of sustainability,

224
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,900
whatever that means is trying to,
is,

225
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,290
is being posed as the alternative tube,
continual positive growth.

226
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,783
And there's,
there's variants of that like 

227
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:48,541
sustainable development,
which means continual improvement within

228
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:50,114
the boundaries.
So one of the things that's changed 

229
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,180
that,
okay,

230
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,500
we're starting to understand that,
that yeah,

231
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,633
we now have the technological capability
to exceed the planet's carrying power 

232
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,190
carrying capacity.
And we have to do something about that.

233
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,473
No one's really sure how to translate 
that recognition of limitation into an 

234
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:15,920
ethic for action.
And most of the translation you see is,

235
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,090
um,
be more environmentally sensitive,

236
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:20,630
something like that.
You know,

237
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:23,450
keep the environment in mind when you're
making your local decisions.

238
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:28,451
But that's an ethic of limitation.
It doesn't seem to be very compelling.

239
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,983
It isn't exactly clear what that means 
as you play your future out over the 

240
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,210
shorter,
medium term.

241
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,860
So it's interesting that you,
uh,

242
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,433
uh,
this because in some ways 

243
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,400
environmentalist was long than most,
uh,

244
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,950
crucial,
uh,

245
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,530
developments,
uh,

246
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:54,210
and the history of ideas and,
uh,

247
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,860
and it was born out of recognition that,
uh,

248
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,770
to pursue growth,
uh,

249
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,620
uh,
without any annual limitations,

250
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:05,330
uh,
it can be distracted,

251
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,340
um,
to,

252
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:08,850
uh,
to our sense of wellbeing.

253
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,163
At the same time.
One could suggest that ever mentalism 

254
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,980
was,
uh,

255
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,560
was,
um,

256
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,600
instrumental in,
in,

257
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,030
uh,
uh,

258
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,180
killing off the idea of progress.
Uh,

259
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,200
even though,
uh,

260
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,063
most people who I run into this with 
gladly defined themselves as 

261
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:33,290
progressive.
Uh,

262
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,550
do you agree that that kind of a 
mechanism,

263
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:36,384
it was,
uh,

264
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,830
I was,
uh,

265
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,693
was,
uh,

266
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,240
responsible for demise of a progressive 
attitude to us history?

267
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,351
Yeah,
I think,

268
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:48,710
I think it,
it,

269
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,410
it's a very complicated question.
I mean,

270
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,040
I would say from a mythological 
perspective,

271
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:55,874
we'd gone from worshiping the great 
father to starting to worship the great 

272
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:02,240
mother.
I think the great mother being something

273
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,440
like die out,
you know,

274
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,130
uh,
the hypothetical planetary,

275
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,910
uh,
the integrated planetary system that has

276
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:14,690
been positive as functional by a number 
of biologists.

277
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,060
I mean,
Gaya was actually named after,

278
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,550
I think a Greek goddess.
Um,

279
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,973
when we were worshiping the great father
that's more like the classical 

280
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,540
patriarchy that the feminists talk 
about.

281
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,374
And you know,
they would say that the patriarchy was 

282
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:32,930
concerned with things like domination 
and,

283
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,710
and,
and a mastery mastery.

284
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,580
Yeah,
exactly.

285
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,810
And that's where the,
the eye,

286
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,940
the sub idea there is something like 
nature is the chaotic enemy and it's,

287
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,860
it has to be overcome and mastered.
And you know,

288
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:53,861
when you reverse that you get no,
it's the patriarchal military industrial

289
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:54,860
complex.

290
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,940
That's the villain.
Then Mother Nature is the soft nurturing

291
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:03,040
force that stands underneath us that 
demands respect and thing is,

292
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:03,874
is both those stories are true.
And even though they lead to opposite 

293
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:10,280
conclusions,
they're both true strangely enough.

294
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,263
Because you know,
opposite things aren't supposed to be 

295
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,670
true simultaneously,
but life is paradoxical.

296
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:19,520
So they often are.
So the question is,

297
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:20,354
well,
what happens when you start to worship 

298
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:22,214
the great mother?
You get more concerned with 

299
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:26,180
egalitarianism and distribution of 
wealth.

300
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:27,014
I suppose that's part of it.
And you can think of that as as a 

301
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:30,464
potential ethos for the future.
I mean we are making progress in that 

302
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:38,201
direction because there are far fewer 
people in poverty as a percentage of the

303
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:39,494
number of people that were alive then 
there were 20 years ago and it looks 

304
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:44,420
like that's going to continue.
You know,

305
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,254
it needs the,
these documents that are emanating from 

306
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:47,924
the UN that talk about the future 
certainly have poverty reduction as a 

307
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,624
very high on their list of priorities as
well as whatever environmental concerns 

308
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:59,180
are also outlined in the documents.

309
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,640
So the vision seems to be something 
like,

310
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,590
well more attention to the conditions 
under which flourishing as possible.

311
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:07,963
So don't destroy the ecosystems that 
support us but also maintain the 

312
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:17,780
possibility of lifting the rest of 
humanity out of squalor.

313
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,920
Those two things might be mutually 
necessary because you know,

314
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,083
it's people at the bottom of the 
socioeconomic hierarchy that are forced 

315
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,470
to do things like slash and burn 
agriculture and,

316
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,760
and the burning of wood for heat and 
cooking.

317
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:32,594
And you know,
those are heavily greenhouse gas 

318
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,790
emitting processes.
So,

319
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,530
I mean I've,
I've come to believe that the,

320
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,933
the answer to the problem of the future 
is actually something that manifests 

321
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:51,800
itself more at a personal level.
Um,

322
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,000
you know,
you might say,

323
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:54,830
well,
what should you do in order to,

324
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,593
to make the future better?
And I think those answers kind of 

325
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:00,650
beckoned in front of you.

326
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,603
What I've,
what I've tried to teach my students is 

327
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:06,920
to try to make the quality of their 
immediate experience better.

328
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,510
And because I think that that is 
something that has cascading properties.

329
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,763
I mean,
in our first conversation we talked 

330
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:16,040
about,
you know,

331
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:20,110
making one room in your house beautiful.
Well it's,

332
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,060
it's hard to make something beautiful 
and if you do it even locally,

333
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:26,420
you learn something from that.
And if you could make something local,

334
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,254
beautiful and perfect,
then it gives you some ideas about how 

335
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,374
to do it on a slightly larger scale.
And maybe it also gives you some 

336
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:34,904
motivation to do that.
And then if you can do it on a slightly 

337
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:37,934
larger scale,
well then you have some idea about how 

338
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:41,840
you might even do it at a slightly 
larger scale.

339
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,623
The guys we were down,
I went down to to New York on Friday to 

340
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,280
talk about ideas of sustainable 
development.

341
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,650
And one of the things that was really 
stressed,

342
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,910
the group had brought a bunch of people 
into act as critics of their ideas.

343
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,343
And one of the things that was discussed
continuously by the critics was the 

344
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:03,864
importance of producing micro projects 
that are designed to make things better 

345
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,993
and scale them up rather than trying to 
come up with a utopian vision from the 

346
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:13,614
top and force it down.
And there's something about that that 

347
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:18,670
seems right to me.
And,

348
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,050
and I think it's something that people 
can engage in as individuals.

349
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,980
Start a micro project to make things 
better around you.

350
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,420
And you might say,
well,

351
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:32,421
at what scale and answer to that is 
whatever scale you can actually manage.

352
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,733
You know,
for some of my students that meant if 

353
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:39,780
they were in fractured families for 
example,

354
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:40,614
which was frequently the case or a 
number one student who took on the 

355
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:47,530
project of buying groceries for the 
family and trying to organize their meal

356
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:48,364
times,
which turned out to be a way more 

357
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:52,260
difficult thing than he had envisioned.

358
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,680
He wrote about it as he,
as he took on the responsibility,

359
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,370
but I think our best bet off,
I really do believe our best bet and and

360
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:06,240
the way forward in the future is to look
around in front of you in your immediate

361
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:09,990
environment and to try to make it 
balanced and healthy.

362
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,273
And I think the cumulative consequences 
of that will be that everything is 

363
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:18,450
balanced and healthy.
One of the things we talked about at the

364
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:22,730
meeting was you know the intuition of 
beauty because they don't think the,

365
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:23,460
the,
the,

366
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,860
the apprehension of beauty is not 
something rational.

367
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:27,630
It's,
it's outside rationality.

368
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,513
But the apprehension of beauty is 
something that that help can help guide 

369
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:37,821
us to construct environments that are 
maximally beneficial I think.

370
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,550
I think that's what the sense of beauty 
is.

371
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:40,384
Therefore,

372
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,260
also about the recognition of the beauty
of being present here and now.

373
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,850
Um,
because,

374
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,870
uh,
in some ways a,

375
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:53,320
this avoids the dilemma of,
of,

376
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,440
uh,
uh,

377
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,763
imagining that,
that we need to entrust ourselves to a 

378
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,670
idealized future.

379
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,070
Yeah.
Well I think,

380
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:01,904
I think if something's beautiful,
I think partly what that means is that 

381
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,070
the ideal future is embedded in it 
already.

382
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,860
And that's why it's beautiful.
I mean,

383
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,960
the future is a tricky thing.
And,

384
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,510
and so are the things around us.
I mean,

385
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,750
everything around us contains what it is
in the present,

386
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:22,584
but it also contains the possibility of 
the multiple things it could be in the 

387
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:26,184
future.
And I think that when you apprehend 

388
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:31,140
something that's beautiful or when you 
construct something that's beautiful,

389
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,303
you're also constructing something that 
has the kind of future you would most 

390
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,490
want to like in it.
I mean,

391
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:42,270
I can give you,
I can give you a brief example of that.

392
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,320
I mean,
the Europe,

393
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:48,350
the Europeans spent centuries trying to 
make their,

394
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,700
their cities and the buildings in the 
beautiful far more than we've,

395
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,243
they've paid,
paid far more attention to that than we 

396
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:59,560
do in the West or in North America 
anyways.

397
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,960
And the consequence of that is that 
everyone flocks to Europe to see the old

398
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:08,130
cities.
There's something about those old cities

399
00:21:08,131 --> 00:21:10,080
that's right there.
Beautiful.

400
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,430
And yet you have to be right.
And being from,

401
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,900
from Europe,
I,

402
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:17,560
uh,
I obviously grew up in,

403
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,403
in,
uh,

404
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,710
in May,
in a number of cities in Europe and,

405
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,050
uh,
and every time I go back to you,

406
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,593
I must say that I'm troubled by the fact
that many of the cities are precisely 

407
00:21:33,471 --> 00:21:36,770
that they are beautiful and nothing 
else.

408
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,230
It should be done to them,
uh,

409
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,220
to enhance the beauty.
They as beautiful as they as they can be

410
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:46,320
in with talking about Paris,
superrich Rome,

411
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,710
uh,
garth in Burke,

412
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:49,040
Stockholm,
uh,

413
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,903
pick any of those cities.
And then you'd be hard pressed to 

414
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:57,740
imagine what else needs to be done to 
make them better.

415
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,010
Right?
But that is in itself a problem,

416
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:02,844
a problem precisely caused by the 
question that we are discussing here 

417
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,970
today,
which is there,

418
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,990
there the city is no longer have a need 
for future and,

419
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:18,480
and,
and if you don't have that need,

420
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,910
then you are stuck.
You are stuck and,

421
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,380
and you are frozen.
And we don't know.

422
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,510
I don't think we know what to do with 
that.

423
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,630
Yeah.
Well,

424
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,440
I mean,
I guess I understand what you're saying.

425
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:36,690
I mean,
some of those cities have become sort of

426
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:37,524
living museums because of that.
Although I guess maybe in some ways 

427
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:41,154
that's not such a bad destani given the 
number of people around the world who 

428
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:45,084
are going to want to travel.
But there's certainly no shortage of 

429
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:50,880
beautification that could be done in the
world's remaining cities.

430
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:53,910
And I think that also speaks to 
environmental concerns.

431
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,773
I mean,
I read some books a while ago about 

432
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:57,354
Chesapeake Bay before the Europeans came
and Chesapeake Bay was one of the 

433
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:05,620
richest natural environments,
I think that ever existed on the planet.

434
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,420
And what's striking about the writings 
about the original Chesapeake Bay is the

435
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:12,820
description of their natural beauty.
And you know,

436
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:14,440
it's enough to make you weep.
It's,

437
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,660
it's enough to make you weak to realize 
how productive than and remarkable those

438
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:22,590
ecosystems once were.
And I mean,

439
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,670
to me,
the fact that those,

440
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,433
those places are gone increasingly gone 
is reflected most particularly in a 

441
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:31,944
decrease in the beauty of the world.
And that's I think a direction for the 

442
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,480
future.
What kind of world do we want?

443
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,523
Well,
it would be lovely to have a world that 

444
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,863
you know,
is unimaginably beautiful and that's 

445
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:50,180
something that people could work towards
and you can do that locally and it,

446
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,490
but in some way sustainability has 
become persaya precisely the response to

447
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:59,330
the idea of progress that,
that there's no longer a question of,

448
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,193
of how to eh change and,
and create a database says never just 

449
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:09,260
before,
but precisely to be able to,

450
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,600
um,
uh,

451
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,630
retained and protect the threat.

452
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,680
Great.
I think that the idea of sustainability,

453
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,753
I think it's gone.
This is something that came up in the 

454
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:28,030
discussions in New York too,
is that sustainability is,

455
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:31,920
it's kind of a vow shall not ethic.
It's,

456
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:32,754
you know,
human beings have raped and pillaged 

457
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:38,931
long enough and it's time for us to 
start limiting our appetites so that you

458
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:40,990
know,
other things beside us,

459
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:43,990
which also have rights can flourish.
It's like,

460
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,830
no,
that isn't,

461
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,390
that isn't what I mean,
that isn't what I'm talking about.

462
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:50,020
And the reason I,
the reason for that is I think that's,

463
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,710
I think that that's built on a 
fundamentally antihistamine.

464
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,310
MMM,
okay.

465
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,870
Okay.
An anti human mythology.

466
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,063
I mean,
it's sort of like the state of being 

467
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,390
before Noah's flood.
You know,

468
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,613
human beings are evil and sinful and 
we're running around making too much 

469
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:10,214
noise and the best thing to happen would
be that nature could come back and wash 

470
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:14,954
us all the way with the flood.
So we should be careful and scaled back 

471
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:21,360
and be good.
I don't think,

472
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,480
like people aren't built to live inside 
limits like that.

473
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,430
W that isn't because our central 
mythologies are hero mythologies.

474
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:34,520
There are about going out and 
transforming chaos into order.

475
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,500
They're not about,
you know,

476
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:41,030
being guilty about who we are and having
to live inside a fence for the safety of

477
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:41,870
everything else.

478
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,233
And,
and yet any of match a match how the 

479
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,860
ethos is precisely about that.

480
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,280
Well that's why you don't trust it.
I think,

481
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,710
you know,
as a psychoanalyst,

482
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,550
whenever anybody ever pause,
it's a good,

483
00:25:56,551 --> 00:25:58,650
I always wonder,
you know,

484
00:25:58,651 --> 00:25:59,484
what the downside to what their positing
is and what the negative motivations 

485
00:26:02,251 --> 00:26:03,960
might be.
And I've met plenty.

486
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,853
I've met plenty of environment metalists
and heard from many more who clearly 

487
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:09,084
don't like people.
I heard a professor at Queen's 

488
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:14,070
university when I was there doing a Tedx
talk.

489
00:26:14,071 --> 00:26:14,904
It was one of the most appalling things 
I've ever heard in my life is this guy 

490
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:19,140
came out.
Um,

491
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,903
and he used the Tedx talk as a forum to 
harangue all the 18 and 19 year olds in 

492
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:26,990
the audience about,
you know,

493
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,400
the essential evilness of humanity.
His decision to,

494
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,333
to,
I think you only had one child on his 

495
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:38,451
decision to limit as repor duction and 
his strong emphasis on the immorality of

496
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:41,070
them doing anything but that.

497
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,640
So he's out there talking to all 18 and 
19 year old kids.

498
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:46,800
In his basic attitude was,
you know,

499
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:47,634
human beings are so awful that the only 
moral thing you can do as young people 

500
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:55,490
is to make bloody sure you don't 
replicate too many of yourselves.

501
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:56,900
It's like,
sorry,

502
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:58,820
I didn't trust that guy.
I think,

503
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,673
I think I thought he was profoundly and 
dangerously anti human and a lot of the 

504
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:09,170
rhetoric that drives the 
environmentalist movement is resentful,

505
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:12,300
anti humanism and it's,
that's no,

506
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,163
that's not the kind of thing that can 
guide the development of a positive 

507
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:18,090
future if that,
you know,

508
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:18,924
I've heard environment,
let's say things like the planet would 

509
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,464
be better off if people,
if there were no people on it or human 

510
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,300
beings are like a cancer.
It's like,

511
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:30,000
sorry buddy,
I'm not taking any guidelines from you.

512
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,770
That to me that sort of ethos is one 
step away from genocidal thinking.

513
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,470
I really mean that too.
No,

514
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,060
it's,
it's hatred for humanity under the guise

515
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:43,070
of love of mother nature.
You know,

516
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,700
I think the same thing about a lot of 
the animal rights guys who want to,

517
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,553
you know,
give rats the same rights as people is 

518
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,953
they want nothing to have rights.
They don't rat want wraps to have the 

519
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:57,110
rights of people there.
It's very dangerous and,

520
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,353
and yet,
and yet and yet for all fall on the 

521
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,850
critical,
uh,

522
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,120
notions that you bring to the a and the 
mentalist cause and those who,

523
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:07,594
uh,
who exhibited in the bureau and fashion 

524
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:15,590
yourself have a later became quite 
concerned with aspects of incremental,

525
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,330
a distraction.
And you've given a talk about it,

526
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,440
about the need to rescue our oceans.

527
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,713
Yeah.
Well that's pretty soon that talk will 

528
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,320
be online pretty soon.
Well,

529
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,483
I got invited to,
to help work on a UN document a few 

530
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,253
years ago,
which was the Secretary Generals High 

531
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,450
Level Panel on global sustainability.
I think that was the name of it.

532
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,940
It's got an awkward title so it escapes 
my mind.

533
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:49,470
But I was invited by the Canadian who 
sat on the committee because he believed

534
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:50,400
that the,
um,

535
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,620
underlying narrative of the UN document 
was outdated and inappropriate.

536
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:59,160
And it was outdated because it was still
kind of a cold war document.

537
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,520
There was still a lot of north versus 
south in at and a lot of,

538
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,950
uh,
you know,

539
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:09,951
capitalism versus socialism slash 
communism and you know,

540
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:12,044
it was 40 years out of date.
Plus it was far too pessimistic about 

541
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,840
the progress that human beings have made
in the last 30 years.

542
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,213
You know,
it didn't take into account the fact 

543
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:25,080
that there aren't very many dictators 
anymore and that way fewer people are in

544
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:25,914
poverty and that we've made a lot of 
progress in getting rid of terrible 

545
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:30,750
communicable diseases and that,
you know,

546
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:31,584
there are 7 billion of us and hardly 
anybody starving and our population has 

547
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:39,270
done to level off at 9,000,000,008
and then start to decline.

548
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,103
So we're in a bottleneck,
but we might be able to get through it 

549
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,610
anyways.
While I was working on that document and

550
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:47,590
trying to clean up the underlying 
narratives,

551
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,990
um,
to make it more balanced.

552
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:54,490
And I wouldn't say more optimistic,
but less anti-human,

553
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,443
I would say.
I did a lot of reading about the 

554
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:00,340
ecological condition,
so to speak.

555
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,174
And you know about global warming and 
that kind of thing and pretty much 

556
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,044
everything I could get my hands on.
And I read a lot of books on the state 

557
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:10,030
of the ocean and they were really 
depressing.

558
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,860
I mean,
we are really,

559
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,520
really destroying the oceans and that's,
that's not good.

560
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,073
And it's not because I'm an 
environmentalist that I say that's not 

561
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:19,984
good.
It's because anybody with any sense can 

562
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:22,834
see that the loss of the beauty and 
dynamism of the oceans would make the 

563
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:29,410
world a less good place to live in for 
people.

564
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,663
You know,
not just for the creatures that are in 

565
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:32,554
the sea,
but you really want to live in a ocean 

566
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:37,270
that's full of nothing but jellyfish.
I mean,

567
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,253
first of all,
Jelly fish don't like human beings very 

568
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:40,780
much.
If there's too many,

569
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,943
too many of them around,
you're not going to be doing a lot of 

570
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,860
swimming in the ocean.
For example,

571
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:49,720
I was reading this week,
okay,

572
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,580
most people don't know this,
but you know,

573
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:53,414
the ocean seems really big,
but almost all the Fisher on the 

574
00:30:56,061 --> 00:31:00,200
continental shelf and the continental 
shelf forney extends a couple of hundred

575
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,720
miles off the continent,
which is why it's called the continental

576
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:03,554
shelf.
And so it isn't that big an area and 

577
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:08,020
that's where all the fish are.
Well,

578
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:13,021
right now we trawl the continental shelf
twice a year,

579
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,620
completely,
completely.

580
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:21,770
That's like mowing the continent with a 
lawnmower twice a year.

581
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,110
And you know,
it's just,

582
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,000
it's mind boggling.

583
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,640
And trawlers they're there,
they're quite the things,

584
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:30,840
you know,
they basically,

585
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:33,600
you with a trawler,
you take a big way to net,

586
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,463
like a huge way to knit and you drag it 
across the ocean floor and you disturb 

587
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:44,260
the entire surface of the floor and you 
raise a huge clouds of dust that,

588
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,910
that pollute the water for,
for even hundreds of miles around.

589
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,103
And you take absolutely everything and 
then you haul it up to the surface and 

590
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:54,774
then you take one 10th of it,
which is the stuff that you're allowed 

591
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:00,300
to harvest and that's commercially 
viable.

592
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,470
The other 90% is dead and you throw all 
of that back.

593
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,223
So I mean,
that's only one of 50 stories about 

594
00:32:11,341 --> 00:32:14,280
ocean degradation that you know,
easily come to mind.

595
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:15,114
So I think that's terrifying.
And I also think that our obsessive 

596
00:32:18,151 --> 00:32:20,820
concern with global warming is blinding 
us to,

597
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,163
um,
ecological catastrophes that are much 

598
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:27,180
more at hand and that would actually be 
more solvable.

599
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,280
At least something could be done about 
them.

600
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:30,683
So,

601
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:36,390
so we are almost 10 yet again,
to summarize,

602
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,630
it's a bit,
um,

603
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,290
uh,
so,

604
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,513
so we obviously the profound needs that 
we recognize I have to do with the 

605
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,700
damage that,
that,

606
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,950
uh,
a thoughtless,

607
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:50,360
uh,
uh,

608
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:55,100
advancement of technology and 
satisfaction of human needs as broad.

609
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,130
Um,
that's,

610
00:32:57,131 --> 00:32:57,964
that's a,
obviously you feel powerfully about 

611
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,394
that,
uh,

612
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,200
as a,
as regards to the oceans,

613
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,990
uh,

614
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,660
I feel powerful you about it when it's 
done stupidly.

615
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,580
I mean there's,
you know,

616
00:33:07,581 --> 00:33:10,520
if you have a crop,
if you have a herd of cows,

617
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,200
you don't shoot every one of them.
You know,

618
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,530
that's,
that's not good for you.

619
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,270
It's not good for the cows,
obviously,

620
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:22,310
but it's really not good for you.
So it isn't,

621
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,773
it isn't,
it isn't even the sacrifice of natural 

622
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,850
resources to the advancement of human 
beings.

623
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,833
That concerns me.
It's the fact that a lot of it's being 

624
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:35,690
done in a way that is clearly have no 
benefit to anyone.

625
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,603
Yeah.
Wasteful.

626
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,860
Uh,
so,

627
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,960
uh,
the,

628
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,863
the,
the,

629
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,620
the question,
the question that,

630
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,190
that we're trying to address here is,
uh,

631
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,660
is,
um,

632
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,430
how to think about the future and,
and,

633
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,283
uh,
whether or not we can draw some solace 

634
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,400
from,
uh,

635
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,540
some notions about what the future can 
be to,

636
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,241
to,
to,

637
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,810
to deal with,
with the,

638
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:02,420
the question of,
uh,

639
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,870
uh,
of social meaning,

640
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:09,871
because history was very much about,
about offering us as a,

641
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:10,971
as a,
as a,

642
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:12,450
as a mankind,
mankind,

643
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,720
as a,
as a,

644
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:18,430
as a collectivity Sam frame within which
to think about the past,

645
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,170
present,
and then tomorrow.

646
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:25,630
And the question is whether or not that 
frame,

647
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,493
uh,
it's available to us without that 

648
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:33,490
timeframe is available to us that allows
us to bookend our existence.

649
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,510
Yeah.
Well I said,

650
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,490
you know,
after,

651
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:42,050
after many years of thinking about this,
the,

652
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,530
the,
the,

653
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,930
I,
I've got kind of radically local in my,

654
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,793
in my thinking I,
because I became so disenchanted with 

655
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:54,370
large scale political solutions to 
things because of the dangers associated

656
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:55,204
with that.
I mean I think the way forward is for 

657
00:34:57,341 --> 00:34:58,174
people to concentrate more intently on,
on their individual lives and the 

658
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:06,961
quality and integrity of those lives and
to learn what they can from Pur pursuing

659
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,103
high quality,
high integrity lies and then just start 

660
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:14,440
applying that at broader scales.
It's a bottom up idea,

661
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,780
you know,
and it,

662
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,190
it,
I think it's,

663
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,020
I think it's the properly he humble sort
of idea.

664
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,780
You know,
it's getting your own house in order and

665
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:26,614
then worry about what,
I wouldn't say even the rest of the 

666
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:29,524
world at that point,
get your own house in order and then 

667
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,133
worry about your local community if you 
can manage that than worry about what's 

668
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,690
beyond your local community.

669
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,990
And I,
I think there is rich meaning and not,

670
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,333
my experience has been that there's rich
meaning and not because there's 

671
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:47,110
something about setting your own house 
in order that's really compelling.

672
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,600
It's an adventure,
it's a compelling adventure.

673
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:52,840
It's also very difficult and you learn 
things from doing it,

674
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,190
you know?
And as I said,

675
00:35:54,191 --> 00:35:55,024
I've run lots of students through this 
process and they've essentially come to 

676
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,360
the same conclusion.
So I would say the,

677
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,780
the future isn't out in distant time 
anymore.

678
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,943
Like it was.
I think the future is right in front of 

679
00:36:11,141 --> 00:36:14,080
us now and I mean literally right in 
front of us.

680
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,660
And if we improve what's right in front 
of us,

681
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:21,661
then that improvement will propagate out
okay.

682
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,370
Temporally and spatially.
And I don't see what are other option is

683
00:36:27,371 --> 00:36:31,330
because what are you going to do?
You're going to try to direct things 10,

684
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,100
10,
20 years into the future.

685
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,173
God,
I can't even imagine what's going to be 

686
00:36:35,831 --> 00:36:36,664
like them.

687
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,701
Well,
I,

688
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:38,534
I think,
I think a key phrase for this 

689
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:47,770
conversation in the future is here,
and then that's the only way in which we

690
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:49,140
can take care of it.
Um,

691
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,343
thank you,
Jordan,

692
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,820
uh,
to be continued,

693
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,290
uh,
in,

694
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:57,230
in the future.
Either still this motto when we get back

695
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,580
to work after some break.
Uh,

696
00:37:00,581 --> 00:37:01,414
anyway.
Uh,

697
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,180
but thank you and,
uh,

698
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,103
are the best.

699
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,093
Bye.
Bye.
