Speaker 1:          00:00:05       So

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       there's a couple of things I want to tell you about today. Many things I want to tell you about.

Speaker 1:          00:00:13       I want to tell you, I'm

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       give you a Schema that's going to enable you to understand. I think it'll enable you to understand stories like the one I told you last time, you remember Jonah and the whale. I want to provide you with this Schema so that you can understand stories like that, but many, many more stories like that and partly what I'm telling you about today in some sense our archetypes and there's a and an archetype is isn't. It's an idea that was made most popular over the last hundred years by Carl Young, but it's a much older idea than that. It's really a platonic ideas and in some ways, and it means it means something like fundamental pattern. And so an architect can manifest itself in different ways. It could be a pattern of emotional response. So that could be something that you're feeling. It could be the way that that emotional response displays itself on your body, on your face.

Speaker 2:          00:01:09       It could be the way that that emotion just fields and displays itself on your face and then plays itself out as a drama in your local environment, so like an angry argument is an archetypal phenomenon and the reason this architectural is because, well, you have one them, you have them, you have them, you have them, everyone has them, and so you can't really think about them as individual. You have to think about them as universal and you can't think about them as something that you create in a sense, although in a sense you do, but also as something that happens to you now. When you read about young and archetypes, it's quite confusing because you can never be sure whether he's talking about an instinct and emotion, a motivational system or a subpersonality or the subpersonality within which those things manifest itself or even the social drama that's being played out in time and space in the social world.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       But our real archetype, I would say is all of those things. At the same time. Now we use archetipal means of expression to represent how we act and that's not the same thing as resent representing what the world is made out of. It's a very different thing and so you could say in some sense, we tell stories and understand stories so that we can figure out how people act and how they should act, and then we conduct science so that we can figure out what the world's like from a material objective perspective and the two things coexist. Uneasily, I think the more primary form of knowledge is actually how to act with the scientific model nested inside it because the most important question that you have to solve as a living organism isn't what the world is made out of. It's how you should act in the world safe from a Darwinian perspective even so that you can live long enough to reproduce.

Speaker 2:          00:02:56       That's basically from a strict biological perspective. In some sense. That's what you have to do in order to be successful. It's kind of obvious, first of all, because you're not very successful if you just go and die, and then of course deaths from a genetic perspective and failing to leave offspring are much the same thing, so now one of the questions might be how is it that we conceive of the world as a place to act in, and that's partly, I'm going to outline a hypothesis for you and then explain the significance of that hypothesis and the hypothesis involves the description of what you might consider constituent elements and also transformation processes. Okay, so as far as I can tell, the constituent elements of the stories that we tell about how people acted should act our characters. Now that makes sense, right? Because you really can't have a drama or a story with characters.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       Now the thing is the characters have to be understandable and so for them to be understandable, they sort of have to be like you or they have to be like someone that you know, but they have to be human. But then again, it's not exactly that they're human because even when you're telling a story about what happened to you today, it's interesting to think about what you do. So someone might say, well, how was your day? And you say, fine. I mean maybe that's the lowest level, lowest resolution, highest abstract story. My Day was fine. It's pretty boring story. It's better than terrible I suppose, but it's not interesting and it's not detailed. But first and gets the notion that things went according to what according to plan or more specifically the things unfolded the way you wanted them to just not exactly the same as according to plan because a plan is kind of a cold cognitive thing, you know, or or, or expected expectation.

Speaker 2:          00:04:55       The cognitive scientists sort of used whether, well while what you, how you wanted them to implies that you have desires and emotions and motivations and that they inform the way that you're acting in the world because you don't just act in the world. You Act in the world so that you tried to turn it into something better than it is right now. Assuming you have any sense, you know, because some people act on the world to make it worse than it is now, but we're going to forget about those people for now. So when you say fine to someone, you basically say, roughly speaking, I got what I wanted today without undue hassle. Okay. So that's a really condensed version of the events of the day and it's not a very good story, although it might suffice for casual conversation. Person might say, no, no, no, what did you do today?

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       And then maybe you'll say, oh, I woke up this morning and I went to university and uh, you know, the subway took a lot longer than it usually does. And so, you know, I used that time to do some studying and then I got to school and I particularly don't lecture, but lunch was really good and I met some friends. And so that's kind of a story, right? And you, the person that you're talking to might listen to you. It's not a particularly compelling story, but it's probably better than fine. And you might say, well, why did you select those elements to talk about? You know, you didn't talk about how many times you blink your eyes, the first minute that you woke up and you didn't describe the motor movements that you used to put your left leg on the floor and you didn't describe.

Speaker 2:          00:06:30       You know what bowl you used for breakfast, and the reason you didn't do that is because a, you don't remember for whatever reason, and B, you don't care and neither does your listener, but that's the peculiar things that your listener is going to care about some things and not care about other things. And if you're a good storyteller, you kind of automatically know which of those things that you should talk about so that you're interesting. Which of the things you should ignore so that you're not boring your listener to death. And you also understand that. They will also understand that. And but you don't know how you do that. All you know is that you're trying to tell an interesting story and in some sense what you're doing is you're trying to reduce a sequence of actions and conceptions of exceptional complexity to the just right, which is like the essential or the moral in some sense and you're trying to convey that and the other person is listening partly because they want to indicate that they care for you and would like to know.

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       They want to stay caught up with your ongoing narrative so that they understand you and maybe also because they might think that they'll gardener some bit of information factual or behavioral that might aid them in some way. You know, so and we're doing that to each other all the time and we automatically do this. We automatically know how to tell stories. And so what I'm saying is that even the person that you describe when you describe yourself to someone else isn't exactly you. It's some representation of you as a sort of generic human being that's going about doing certain kinds of interesting things in the world. Or here's a way of thinking about it. Roughly is that you make yourself the hero of your own story and so you kind of know that because when you go to a movie and movies are usually romances, say or hero stories will, romances or adventures or both roughly speaking.

Speaker 2:          00:08:15       Um, you know, sometimes they turn out well and that's a comedy and sometimes they don't turn out so well and that's a tragedy. But when you go there, what you basically see is a story about another person who sort of like you, who's the hero and what you do is you track them through a sequence of adventures. And usually what you track them through isn't things were good and then they stayed good and then at the end they were still the same as they were at the beginning. And good, you know, because why do you want to watch that? And you might say, well you should because isn't that pleasant? The person's happy and then they stay happy and then they end happy and everyone's happy. It's why. Why isn't that interesting? But it isn't. And really what want to see is you either see, you want to see someone get into trouble and fail in a spectacularly interesting way, or you want to see someone get into trouble and then overcome it in a spectacularly interesting way.

Speaker 2:          00:09:07       And so there's this idea in the, in the story that the person has to undergo some kind of transformation in the midst of their travails and efforts in order for it to be interesting. So they have to start in one place. They have to end up somewhere that's not so good in a very, very complicated way. And then maybe by transforming their character, by transforming the surroundings are but coming to some sort of realization, or maybe just by dimwitted luck, they managed to solve the set of problems that emerge triumphant at the other end. Right? So that's the meaning of Jonah and the whale, or you remember what happens to Jonah is that he's got this destiny he supposed to be pursuing. Any decides that it's too much trouble. Well, not unsurprisingly, because if you remember what he was told to do was go to tell a whole city that they were misbehaving, assuming rightly as he did, that that would not make him pretty particularly popular and maybe he'd get killed and even if he did it, it would be extraordinarily difficult. He thought, there's no damn way I'm doing that. So he denied his destiny and as a consequence he fell into the abyss and was swallowed up,

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       and then because he repented and decided to carry on with what he was to carry on with his responsibilities, the creature of the abyss spitting back up and he got to go along his merry way. Now you might say, well, nothing like that has ever happened to you, but that's wrong. Things like that happen to you all the time and you know it. So here, here, here's a couple of examples and you'll be able to draw all sorts of examples from your own life. That's the story of betrayal. For example, maybe in one of your relatively uninformed

Speaker 2:          00:10:54       flurries, you ended up establishing a relationship with someone who was really not good for you. And that might mean while they just, it was just a bad personality match or it might mean they really weren't good for you because you know, you could get pretty unlucky and you can get tangled up with someone who's very deceitful and very malevolent and who could care less about your maybe who even wants to hurt you. And then you can establish a trusting relationship with them. Or at least you trust them. And then one day you know, you find out that they are not who they said they weren't. Or even more importantly, they are not who you thought they were. And so then maybe you're in a committed relationship and they'd be trained you with someone else. And so then you think, well, there you are at home and you're, you know, you're perfectly happy about being at home and then your partner comes home and for one reason or another, you find out that they're having an affair or that they'd be trained you or that they'd lied to you.

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       And some other spectacularly important way. And maybe it's a lover and maybe it's a family member. Maybe it's assembling and maybe it's a friend, whatever, it doesn't matter, and so here's the way of thinking about it. The minute before they come home, you're in one place and you remember places just to place, right? A place is a place in time because we live in space time. We live in time and place and what that means is you can be in the same place in one minute and a completely different place in the next minute even if you haven't even moved and so places a very, very complicated idea, so you're sitting at home and you're watching oprah and you're perfectly content to do that and then the person comes home and the bottom of your world falls out and then all of a sudden you're not where you thought you were in.

Speaker 2:          00:12:31       It's a really weird place that you are now because it's not where you were. That's for sure, but you also don't know where it is because you don't know who that person is. That's in that room with you. You don't know what your past with them was or what it meant or anything else about it. Because it was predicated on absolute misperceptions, so none of your memories about those events are valid even though you have them as memories and then you have a worst problem, which is if you're betrayed badly enough, not only are you not going to understand your immediate past with that person, oh, and by the way, your future is also gone. So that's a big problem as is your presence has become radically more complex, but it's worse than that because if you're really betrayed, you're also going to think, who am I that I could be that stupid?

Speaker 2:          00:13:19       And then you're going to think what is a human being that they can be that corrupt and so not only has the have the fundamentals being kicked out of the substructure of your perceptions, but your notion of what it means to be you and what it needs to be human might've been seriously disrupted. And you know the thing about that is that's a non trivial event. People call that traumatic it didn't like and it's like a physical wound and in fact it has. Certainly if the trauma is great enough, it can produce a psychophysiological wound because that sort of trauma, a deep betrayal is a good example, will damage your brain and maybe you'll recover from it and maybe you won't. And one of the ways that that's been represented forever in mythological stories is by being swallowed up by a subterranean beast. It's something that comes up from the depths and pulls you down and then you're in it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:14       Now why is that? Well, that's an extraordinarily complicated question, but here, here's the answer. As nearly as I can tell, we evolved a very complicated neuro-psychological system to signal alarm. So that's anxiety, threat, threat sensitive, right? And that makes us freeze, for example. And when you look at how an animal uses that system, let's say a mammal, just to keep it simple because we're all mammals and so we can kind of understand mammals. So if a rabbit sees a wolf, for example, it's going to freeze so that the wolf camp c and if I, if a rat smells like cat, even if it has never smelled a cat and it's whole life, it's going to also freeze. And interestingly with rats, if you put rats in a natural environment, which means they get to help little rat dominance hierarchies, a little rap families and they're not like little white rats alone in a cage.

Speaker 2:          00:15:08       They're happy family rats and they've got their burrows and they live in their little societies that maybe there is a part of their territory where they can go get food and they're used to that. So they'll scurry out there in the day kind of hiding because they don't like light. Or maybe they'll scurry out at night because rats are night things and they'll get their food and they'll eat it or bring it back or whatever they, whatever they do, share it with their family or at least bring it back. Well, let's say that you put a cat out there or maybe you even just put a cap there and take it away. So that the place smells like cat. Well, if one of those rats goes out there and sees that cat, first of all it's going to freeze and it is not a happy thing because imagine you're a rat and a thing that's four times as big as a lion suddenly appears on your front yard.

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       It's like, that's rough, man. You're going to phrase it, then you're going to go hide downstairs and what are you going to do? Well, if you're a rat, you're going to screen for 24 hours, which is nonstop with your little beak poking out of your borough so everyone can hear you scream. And that's the same given the length of life as you're screaming nonstop for two weeks. So like that, racks nervous. It's not happy about the whole cap thing. And then maybe maybe if no more cat odor happens by and no hypervigilant rat see any more cats than after it screens for two weeks. It starts to calm down a little bit and maybe then it starts to remember that it's hungry and that you know, there's things to attend to. And so then maybe it very, very carefully goes back out where it was foraging for food, sort of crunched over and hypervigilant to not moving very much in case that damn cats around.

Speaker 2:          00:16:39       And then maybe slowly it regains control over its territory. It runs back and forth trying to ensure that none of that place that used to be safe has gone troublesome cats associated with it anymore. And so in some sense, the bottom fell out of that rats life. Now the thing is the rat has predator detection systems that are associated with extreme anxiety and escape. They're automatically activated whenever there's a Predator in sight. And we have those systems too. But human beings are. You might say, well, okay, rats have predators, enemies. Humans have predators and enemies. Okay? So then we might say, well, what's a human predator slash enemy? Well, it depends on how long a period of time over which you wish to calculate what constitutes human. Because we know, for example, that $60 million years ago, your primary Predator when you were wandering around in trees and we're only about this big with stakes and so snake is a Predator and an enemy and you know, you guys can easily learn how to be afraid of snakes and maybe you're innately afraid of them to begin with.

Speaker 2:          00:17:47       No one. The science on that is not exactly clear, although it certainly indicates that you could easily learn snake fear and uh, probably indicates that really it's a neat. It's an eight inch chimpanzees. So why not us, you know, it's not that long since we split off the evolutionary pathway from the common chip human ancestor. So enemies, snakes. What else? How about crocodiles? Those things pulled a lot of your ancestors. Well, not your ancestors because they got pulled under water. But when we were wondering around on the African Veldt and we went down to the river to have some water, you can be sure that a fair number of us got pulled underneath by crocodiles. And so crocodiles and you know, those are creepy things. Crocodiles. Hey, it'd be. They figure it nightmares and they figure in horror movies and you can imagine yourself in Florida now, there with alligators and thinking, you know, it'd be just as well if they didn't come too close to your boat with their little beady eyes and they're great big teeth that, you know, they're unpleasant things. And then there's lions, hyenas, okay. Another one of those things. You might take a lion in a Hyena or different things, but they're not. I would say they're large tooth mammalian carnivores. It's like a medic category. And so they sort of fit in that Predator enemy category and your nervous system is prepared to respond to predatory eyes and teeth and no wonder because predatory eyes track you down at teeth eat you and they bite you. And so it's a good thing that you're aware of those and that you can detect them rapidly. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       what else is a human enemy?

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       How about another human? How would that be? You think more people have died from other humans are from predators? Well, I suspect that since we've actually been human, if that's maybe 150,000 years, because that's about when it appears that we were more or less genetically identical to what we are now. My guess is that humans have got it all over predators. I mean lots of us, God eat and let's not be too shy about discussing that, but now at least man, it's other people. Okay, well what about yourself? How about you as your own enemy? While? Well, then you make it psychological. Maybe it's not other people may, but it's the evil in their hearts or maybe it's the evil in your hearts. So you see, so this is a way of thinking about it, is that we have a circuit to deal with threats, but the threats exist all the way from the primordial biological, like actual predators, snakes, all the way up to the incredibly abstract.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       Like my great enemy is the evil intentions that other people harbored towards me or that maybe I have in my own heart. Okay? So that's that entire complex of predatory slash threat slash evil because it's become psychologize to that point. That's one of the things that can be a character in a movie, and it is right. It's the antagonist, it's the adversary that's the, that's the architectural element. It's the thing that opposes you in every way and you can locate that in all sorts of different places, right? You could have a story about how someone is grappling with their own evil impulses up. What's the name of that serial killer thing? I'm Dexter Dexter's. Got that problem. People are pretty fascinated by that show, right? A serial killer who can do good, like sort of like a human being in some sense. You know, so that's.

Speaker 2:          00:21:07       There's golf, this psychological barrier between good and evil in his heart or maybe the, maybe the, the enemy is externalized. So maybe it's Batman and the joker and the joker is a pretty. The is really a figure of, of chaotic evil. Fundamentally, you know, in the Best Batman movie, which was the one with a, with the joker. And it wasn't Jack Nicholson who played the ledger ledger. Yeah, yeah. Heath Ledger, you know, that was rough on old heath and no wonder, you know, because he embodied this archetypal character and that joker was so much of an adversary that he didn't even want to win, right? You can understand adversaries that want to, when its adversaries that want to make everyone lose, that are really hard to understand, and that's part of what made that movie, you know, relatively striking and memorable. And he really embodied that character well. And so one, here's two sets of characters that make up stories, hero and address Siri, okay?

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       So, and you can, you can understand that at multiple levels simultaneously. Um, here's another set of characters. Now, here's why I think these characters are fundamental elements of our cognitive structure caught cognitive substructure. First of all, I think that really what we want to know is not what is, but we want to know how to act, how to conduct ourselves in the world. We're moving creatures, right? We don't just sit there on a rock and filter seawater through our guilt. We have to go out there and contend with the world. And so we need to know how to do that, we need to know how to do it and how not to do it. So we can look for good examples and we can look for bad examples. We don't want just any old good example. We want a good example that's boiled right down to excellent example and we want a bad example that's boiled right down to excellent bad example.

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       And so a good example would be a character who is an amalgam of all the good things about good people and an evil character would be an announcement of all evil things about bad people and the more pure in some sense, in essence, both of those characters are the more architects of the story. And so an archetypal story is good versus evil and you might think you don't believe in good versus evil, but it doesn't really matter what you believe because when you go to movies, you watch that and you watch it as if you believe it. And I would say this is an existential claim by the way, is that it doesn't matter what you say you believe, because what do you know about what matters is how you act out what you believe, and if you really want to find out what you believe, you don't ask yourself what you believe.

Speaker 2:          00:23:32       You Watch yourself act and you did those from that what you believe. And so if you don't believe, for example, in a good versus evil architectural struggle and what are you doing? Watching wars, for example. Okay, because obviously that's an archetypal story, just like Harry Potter is an archetypal story. And both of those are archetypal stories about good versus evil. Okay? Next set of categories. So imagine that we've been living in familial groups for who knows how long, let's say 3 million years. Just for the sake of argument. We were living in tribal groups way, way longer than that. You know, if, if you think about a tribal group at something that might extend back farther than chimpanzees were living in dominance hierarchies for way longer than tribal groups, but the family group, you got to think we'd be living in family groups for about as long as we've been extraordinarily dependent as infants and as long as we've had really large brains.

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       And so again, that's why you can't draw, you know, pipeline. But because we'd been getting bigger and bigger brains for quite a long time, but it's, it's in the millions of years let's say. And so, and the other thing that you might think about is that you know, your cognitive apparatus, your perceptual apparatus to your emotional apparatus has originated within an environment. Obviously now we tend to think of the environment as the natural environment. And then we tend to think of the natural environment is like a forest. But the natural environment for primates say is only forest to some degree. I mean, first of all, we didn't just dwell in forests because we were also veldt dwelling creatures, but also we didn't really dwell among trees. We dwelled among other primates like us, and so our primary environment is actually other people and then you might say, okay, what are the fundamental categories of the other people?

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       Well, how about mother? That's a big one because the probability that you had a mother, it's like it's up there at about 100 percent. You know, and if there wasn't even if you're new, you lost your biological mother at birth. If someone didn't fulfill the archetypal role as mother, then you don't live and that doesn't just mean providing you with food and water and shelter. Because if you provide a child under one with food and water and shelter and that's it, they die. You have to pick them up, you have to touch them. You have to rock them back and forth. You have to communicate with them. If you don't give them physical attention, their nervous systems shut down and they die. And so that's part of the reason why in well in eastern European orphanages, orphanages before the wall fell down, the death rate, especially in places like Romania in the orphanage, is it's an awful story, was unbelievably high.

Speaker 2:          00:26:24       And if the kids didn't die, they were just so crippled psychologically that they never recovered and that was because people didn't touch them and didn't interact with them. And so you need a creature playing out the architectural role of mother to entice you into life. Otherwise you just perish. So mother, that's a category man. And then well, fathers to category two and it's the same thing applies there. And even if you don't have a father, there's a male power structure around you, a dominance hierarchy, roughly speaking, that acts in the paternal role. And there's no getting away from that unless you don't live in a society. And then if you don't live in a society, then you just die because you can't live by yourself. So father and mother are primary categories. And then there's the primary category of the individual because wherever you are, there you are.

Speaker 2:          00:27:13       And that's been the case for every human being that's ever existed. So the fundamental categories are individual, mother and father. And there's another fundamental category which we alluded to, which is horrible thing that lives at the bottom of a pit that will devour you. And that has a psychological reality, objective, reality, and that's, as I said, that's equivalent to the story of Jonah being gobbled up by the whale. That happens. That sort of story is very common. Pinocchio is a story like that, right? Pinocchio has an existential problem. He doesn't know how to be a real boy. It turns out that in order to become a real boy, we might regard that as a fully developed individual. He has to go down to the bottom of the ocean, into a whale, and rescue his father. Well, you, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see the kinship between that story and the story of Jonah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       It's the same story. Jonah had to reestablish his relationship with God the father in order to successfully make a passage from aimless and disobedient character to someone who was alive on shore and pursuing a particular path. It's the same motif. It's a very, very, very common motif. And the reason for that is that that's how people transform. You know, they hit an obstacle of some sort that just blows them into pieces and they go down into the depths, into the abyss and they lived down there for awhile and it's not pleasant and maybe they learn something while they're down there if they're lucky and they get back up and that's the story of human development. You never learn something without having something small die and sometimes you learn something and something big dies and then you know, you put yourself back together and you pick up the pieces and you emerge unscathed, hopefully in perhaps transformed and you carry on.

Speaker 2:          00:29:05       And so the human developmental story isn't an upward march in a linear manner. You know, up on even slope. It's perhaps upwards and onwards, but it's like this, it's punctuated by catastrophes. And of course you guys know that because obviously, I mean how many times, how many people in this room have been seriously unhappy at one point in their life for more than two weeks. Okay. Is there anyone who hasn't had that experience breathing? Yes. Have you not had that experience? Oh yeah. Oh, sorry. I thought you raised your hand. Has Anybody had that experience? Okay. Okay. So maybe not you. Well, that's good. Congratulations. That's really amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:29:50       So it's coming. So yeah. Yeah. So,

Speaker 2:          00:30:01       so the thing is, you know here, here's one way of looking at it. That's reality. Reality is that you're, your environment is punctuated by desense your pathways punctuated by descent and when you're ascending, that's one place. And when you're descending and at the bottom, that's another place. And I can tell you that and this will help you with your interpretation of stories, is that the times when you descend is equivalent to a voyage to the underworld. That's what a voyage to the underworld means and mythology. The bottom has fallen out and down you go and you know, this sort of thing because look, if I say we're all skating on thin ice, like is there anybody here who doesn't know what that means? Okay. So what does it mean? What does it mean to break?

Speaker 2:          00:30:53       The ice can fall out in anytime and then what happens down? You Go, right? And it's cold down there. Yeah. Maybe you don't get back up. Yeah. And it's the sort of story that sort of sends a chill down your spine and it should because that's life. And so one of the things that I really like about advanced personality theory is that it takes that into account and says, yeah, yeah, that's life. Okay, now that we've established that, what do we do? And so then it becomes something like this. It's not so much how do you stop yourself from descending and ascending because good luck with that, but since you're going to have to do that, how do you do it? And so part of the reason that I called this course personality and its transformations is because one, one thing that you can learn about yourself as who you are, and that's really useful, but the other thing that you can learn about yourself is how it is that you can conduct yourself across time.

Speaker 2:          00:31:50       And that means you're going to have to conduct yourself so that you can weather storms. And some of those might be you make a mistake in the ice breaks, you know? And some of it is, yeah, the ice breaks and it's no mistake at all, it's just how it is, you know, so when you're one of your parents developed Alzheimer's disease for example, but you could say that's your mistake because you're not smart enough to do anything about it and you know, be a better clue in because otherwise the disease is going to continue. But on the other hand, really thinking about it as a personal fault seems inappropriate. It's just a catastrophe that's associated with being alive. And that's what life is, you know? And so one of the things you see, for example, in all of the major trends of religious thinking all around the world and talk about religious thinking because those are the deepest kinds of stories.

Speaker 2:          00:32:37       That's really what makes them, by the way, it's always the same message. Life is suffering. And the reason for that is because we skate on thin ice. Okay? And you can say, well, we should pick up the damn ice and fair enough, you know? Right. Definitely. But you should also prepare yourself to swim so that when you fall in, you don't die. So now the job story has a hint or two in it, you know, so the first thing that happens is job is in some sense called the action now because that's an old story because it's a primarily Judaeo Christian and religious story. The call to action takes the force of a divine command. Right now you might think, well, there's such a thing exist and it's a silly question in some ways because whether or not something exists depends on what you mean by exist, you know, and that can vary with your philosophical presuppositions, but it also, it also varies on why you're asking the question and where you're looking for the answer. So for example, here's an example. Do you believe that there are things that you shouldn't do? Like is there anyone here who doesn't believe that? Or more importantly, is there anyone here who doesn't act like they believe it? So you wake up in the morning and you think, yeah, there's a bunch of things I should do, or are there some things I should do next week? Are there some things I should do with my life? Yes, that's a common thought. Is anyone not think that way?

Speaker 2:          00:34:07       Okay, so you know, if you're not thinking that way, you end up pretty depressed because then you think, well, there's nothing I should do with my life and that's not such a happy thought because life is hard and then if there's nothing to do with this wall, all you're they're stuck with is a bunch of suffering and that doesn't seem like a very good idea. Okay, so then you might say, well, what exactly does should mean?

Speaker 2:          00:34:28       Well, it means that you have a moral obligation of some sort. You might say, well, you decided that yourself and the answer that it's like no wrong. You haven't decided that you yourself, are you kidding? You'd be at a complete psychopath if you decided that by yourself, right? I mean, if you're even the Vegas civilized, then you decide what it is that you should do or what you should do manifests itself within you as a context of a dialogue that you're continually having with yourself, but also with everyone around you and not only only with everyone around you, but with the entire history of mankind because we're all historical creatures and you know what you think you should do is been shaped by what your parents think of that was shaped by what their parents thought that was shaped by what their parents thought and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:35:17       Back into the depths of history as far back as you can possibly imagine, both historically and biologically. So in some sense there is a call to action within people. Now, you know, in any sort of quest story like the Hobbit, let's say, or the Lord of the rings for that matter. You know, the story always starts with a call to action, right? For some reason or another, the little hobbit character, which by the way is, you know, the hobbits live in this little protected place and they're not very big and they're not very smart and they don't know about the wide world beyond the board of the great forces of good and evil are at combat and one hobbit who's a little bit more adventurous than the rest gets called act gets called upon to act and in harbord stories, it's usually the wizard who manages it, right?

Speaker 2:          00:36:02       So it's a magical figure of some sort. He's extraordinarily wise and extraordinarily old who might as well be gone for all intents and purposes, who says, you know, it's time for you to go and become a thief. Will. That's what happens in the Hobbit, right? Because very weird thing because obviously that's Frodo, right? Photos, the hobbit in the Hobbit, and Bilbo is the hobbit and the Lord of the rings. If I remembered the other way around. Bilbo is the poverty in the hobbit. Fine, Bilbo. Okay, so bill will gets called to action and he's gonna go, he's gonna. Go find a dragon. The dragon is the same thing, that swallow job, it's the same story and the Jew and the dragon has a treasure, which is a weird thing. It's like what's up with dragons, right? What do they hoard? Virgins. That's the St George Story. It's a very, very old story or goal and that's weird behavior for a predatory lizard, but anyways, you accept that without any problem with course, a dragon lives underground in a big mountain that was excavated by doors and sits on a treasure.

Speaker 2:          00:37:03       It's like we go to. We don't have any problem with that idea. Well, why fate? I mean really, you really believe that? And the answer is well, well enough to read the damn book and to make the. I mean, how many people went and watched the Lord of the Rings? How many people? And think about it worldwide. How much money did a Harry Potter generate? You know, I bet to Harry Potter generated more money than the remaining steel mills in Britain. If you calculated it across the amount of time since those stories emerged, right? So of course there's a lizard in a predatory lizard and Harry Potter too. It's the thing that skitters around underneath hogwarts and turns you to stone with the glance of it. I. Oh, and does that Lizard Hoard vergence? Well, what's the name of the woman that. The girl that he kidnaps Jenny. Right. Okay. What's the word? Jenny? From Virginia. Right. Good. Good. And she's Harry's first month interest and he rescues her from the damn snake and he gets parallels. Won't paralyze, wouldn't while he's doing it. What rescue is? Harry Phoenix,

Speaker 2:          00:38:20       right? A Phoenix. Okay. So the Bass Bites Harry and so he's going to die. The Phoenix comes along. Who owns the Phoenix? Dumbledore. Yeah. Yeah. What does the Phoenix do? Cries and cries into Harry's wounds. Yes. What happens then? What happens to Harry? He comes back to life. Death and resurrection story. So the thing that's willing to die and resurrect is the thing that gets the virgin from the snake. It's like, does that make sense? Well, you think it makes sense even though you don't really know why it makes sense. And then what happens to the what? Ams to the Phoenix after it does that Burns itself up in a puff of flame and is reborn, so it's the story told twice the thing that dies in Israel. Reborn is the thing that conquers the serpentine and and rescues the feminine roughly speaking. So it's not gold in that situation, but it doesn't matter.

Speaker 2:          00:39:18       It's the same story. It's always the same story. So, and when you don't hear that story, like when your culture isn't providing you with rich stories of that sort that are derived directly from your tradition. Somebody like an unemployed welfare mother in Britain has it pop up full fledged into her brilliant imagination and lays out seven books and makes herself more money than the queen. Right? Right. And that, you know, it's a cinderella story. It's a bloody amazing story. And then there's all those books and all those kids learn to read because of the books. And then there's all those movies and everybody goes and sees them and no one notices that they don't know what the hell they're doing while they're doing it. And it follows the same old story. Alright, so you've got your individual that's you, the hero, then you got the adversary to that.

Speaker 2:          00:40:04       That's your enemy. Wherever that enemy might happen to me, that's the forces that oppose oppose you, but mostly psychological forces of one form or another. Then you've got the father. Well, there's two kinds of fathers. What guy? Good for others and bad fathers. So here's an example. I'm the lion king. So the lion king as a father, right? A asa and asa has a brother who's his brother scar and what's up with scar? Not a pleasant guy. Partly maybe because he's scarred sometimes. Ha. Well really a, he's kind of skinny. He said he came from the shallow end of the gene pool. Obviously something's happened to him because he has this scar. He's arrogant and brilliant, which is very common set of attributes for negative father figures and he's out to doing the cane. Right? So what does he represent? Well, you could say, here's a way of thinking about it sociologically.

Speaker 2:          00:41:05       One of the things you hear very frequently, I'm sure many of you have heard this ad Nauseum, is that there's such a thing as the patriarchy, right? The patriarchy, while. Okay. The Petro Patriarchy is a mythological construct and I mean that, I mean that technically speaking, you have a paternal figure that basically represents it can represent the father directly or it can represent the structure of male power. It's not just male power, but whatever for for the time being, we'll, we'll stick with that. It has a positive aspect which is why you get to sit here and you're not being snowed on and freezing to death. So that's the positive element and it has a negative element and the negative element is the arbitrary tyranny that's associated with any social organization. Right. So, okay. What do you think of the u of t like your first year? Did you enjoy it? How many people didn't enjoy it? Okay. How many people did enjoy it? All right, so mark, by the looks of things, some of you and some of you are neutral. You either enjoyed it or, or didn't enjoy it or you don't have the mental energy to crank your arm, so. Okay. So mostly you didn't enjoy it. What the hell are you doing here? They're like, what? Why bother? So someone who didn't enjoy it as answered me that maybe you really didn't enjoy it, but here you are. Why are you still here?

Speaker 2:          00:42:31       That's the sunk cost answer. It's like you, you waited for a bus for half an hour. It hasn't shown up. The right thing to do is wait for another half an hour. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:42:41       Well, to put it in the morning, I approached it from a different angle. So basically I change when I was starting.

Speaker 2:          00:42:48       How would that work? Worked out well, was it the second time? I did try it. It worked out well. Good. Good. So was that an unpleasant process? Were you confused? Did you come out the other end? Um, yeah, right on. You more mature. Uh, yeah. You know more than you did five years ago. I hope so. Was it worth it? I hope so. Good. Good for you. Good for you. Well Look, look, you make a calculation and what's wrong with the University of Toronto? Well there's 60,000 students for a starter. Like what the Hell do you matter? You know, really your numbered and it feels like that a lot of the time. So it's a very impersonal institution and you're sort of tossed into it so you're basically facing a giant of some magnitude who's kind of blind and who sort of archaic, which is always what culture is, right?

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       Culture is always blind because it's a product of yesterday and it's. And it's archaic, it's not up to date, so you're going to have a problem with it and you have that problem when you come to the university. So you stick with it though because it's got two faces. One face is sank or swam there guys. And the other face is man, if you're careful and you and establish a relationship with this kind of institution, you can learn so much that you won't even be the same person when you come out. Maybe you'll be able to think that'd be good. You know, if you learn to think, then you don't run into sharp things when you wander through life because you're smart enough to see where they are and avoid them, you know, and maybe you can think your way to a target or maybe you could even think about a target that's worthwhile and you can figure out how to attain it and maybe you learn to write and then you can articulate your ideas and you can express them with some power and you could make, you know, you can be a positive force in the world and you can be successful in all sorts of ways.

Speaker 2:          00:44:38       And if you have to put up with being tyrannized by a half dad monster, with, with Alzheimer's disease, that's blind. Well that's life and it could be a lot worse because at least you're contending with something that has a positive element. You know, in lots of societies if you're up against the, the blind giant of society, the best that you can hope for is that it isn't running around trying to stomp on you all the time. And I would say that's more the standard human experience. So yeah, there's a patriarchy and yet it's negative. Obviously it's always been like that, but by the same token, you know there's a good guy embedded in that too, and that's the thing you want to have a relationship with and that's the same old story. It's always been like that. There's always a wise king and tyrant and they're always fighting and sometimes the wise king, king winds, sometimes the tyrant winds and then when the tire, when it's up to the hero to defeat the tyrant and reestablish the rightful king, and that's actually what you're trying to do when you're in university because the rightful king in some senses, a corpse that's embedded inside the university and your job is to revivify it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:47       You know, you're the living element of the university and all the knowledge is dead. It's just lying around and some of it's out of date. You know, you come in here and you, you revise it so that society can continue and so that you can benefit from the relationship. Well, that's the positive and negative. Great father, the king and the tyrant. And then another, another level is the feminine. The Feminine is not women. Women partake of the feminine and the masculine, just like men partake of the feminine and the masculine, but the maternal element, the feminine elements is nature. Positive nature. Well, that's the thing that the environmentalists love, right? That's flowers and French landscapes and you know, pleasant days, picnic in the park and and beautiful sunshine and fresh air and clean water. But then there's another side. Another side is, do you know what the Guinea worm is?

Speaker 2:          00:46:41       Does anybody know what a Guinea word is? Well, I'm going to tell you, although you're not going to be happy about it, so a Guinea worm is this horrible parasite that burrows under the skin, mostly of children, mostly in Africa, and it's about two feet long, so it makes these coils around their legs and then it'll poke its little head out and then you can pull it out, but it tends to break and if that happens, then it gets infected. It May, maybe you die and so you can wrap it around a pencil very slowly and pull it out. That's nature. Now there's a doctor who's a Canadian doctor who wasn't really very happy about those Damn Guinea worms and he's just about eradicated them and like hooray for him, but you know, when we're talking about the environment, especially when we're thinking about it and mythological categories and we're talking about nature, it's like, yeah, yeah, it's nature and all its beneficial glory, but it's also all the things that would just assume, eat you in the most awful possible way and you need to know that too, because if you think of nature has only been official in its positive archetypal element that that's mother nature in all her glory, then you tend to denigrate the utility of the positive element of culture.

Speaker 2:          00:47:46       You know it's culture that protects you from the horrible elements of nature. You wouldn't even be able to think about. Nature is beautiful if you weren't already so protected from it. You know you're more protected from it than any human beings ever have been anywhere in the entire history of life. And so in this unbelievably protected environment, you can think, oh well we should go easy on nature because isn't it so beautiful? It's like, yeah, well, yes and no. And it's not all beauty. It's certainly not because nature will eventually kill you. So it even if it doesn't go well, it's going to kill you. It will also make you sick. It will also make everyone that you know sick and it will kill all of them too. So it's not so such a bad thing to have a little bit of empathy for human beings given that we have to contend with that.

Speaker 2:          00:48:34       And you know, if we're destroying everything, which we're not, it's also returning the favor. So. Alright, so there's the sub stripe at the bottom of things. There's this terrible monster, but it hoards gold. And so encountering it, defeating it, challenging it, facing it can be unbelievably productive. And that's a symbol of the absolute unknown. That's where you go when things fall apart, you don't know where you are. So where are you? You're aware, you don't know what things are. And that's a place. And what's interesting about it is that there are rules to act in that place and that's what's so helpful because you know, if you're in a place that you don't know what to do and that's that you're done. But if there's a pattern to what you can do in a circumstance like that, then in July and on your feet and you're ready to contend and maybe the trip down into the underworld is something you can undertake on your own accord.

Speaker 2:          00:49:28       And you can come back with the treasurer and steadying instead of ending up as dragon food or worse. And then when you're conceptualizing your relationship to other people, well, well let's say this society, first of all, it's like, yeah, obviously you face a tyrant. Of course you do. But that is all you face. And you need to be grateful for what you've been given by your culture. And you actually have to understand what that culture is because it's you. And if you don't rescue that part of you and that part of the culture that everything gets dad and stale and tyrannical and everything goes immediately to help. And that's not a good thing. And then with regards to nature, well you obviously have to appreciate the positive element of nature and you have to enter into a relationship with it, but you don't bloody well want to forget that like things are out to get you and you know you have to be intelligent and, and ready and awake so that you can prevail against them and you have to be grateful for what you've been offered by other people and by the tremendous efforts of all of culture across all of the time, that's put you in a position where you're so unbelievably privileged and have so many opportunities at your, at your disposal.

Speaker 2:          00:50:40       Well. So that's kind of the archetypal story of human beings. We always face nature and it's always on our side. We always face our culture. It's always on our site and we always have ourselves and those things that are arrayed against us internally, externally. And that's the. You could say that's the existential world. It's the world of drama and the things that are really compelling to you as means of communicating. Use those categories to provide you with information because what you're trying to figure out is if that's the landscape that makes up your being. So that's a phenomenological idea. How is it that you weave your way through it? While that's what we're going to figure out? Well, we go through this class. Okay, so that's the mythological background. So there's the character, illogical elements that I just described. And then there's the punctuated movement forward. Now you know, the problem with that is that when things fall apart, it's not like you just fall apart psychologically. It's not just a psychological condition. You know, if someone's be trade you deeply, that might be because you're naive and unready and maybe that's a psychological element. Maybe you're just young and you know you don't know battery and you couldn't, but there's also the real fact of the problem that you have in fact been betrayed and now you don't know what to do. So there's reality in it as well as just what psychological.

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       And so

Speaker 2:          00:52:05       one of the things that you might. One of the ways that you might construe personality theories that have to deal with a description of the way people are and a description of how they might move towards mental health is that there are maps that tell you how to their maps of that landscape that tell you how to Orient Yourself so that you can succeed and even better, and this is a Piagetian idea. It's not only so that you can succeed, it's so that you can succeed in a way that your family succeed so that they can succeed in a way that society succeeds so that everything works better at the same time. And that's really success, you know, and that's like you're winning a game that everyone wants to play well, what a deal. You get to move forward and everyone else gets to enjoy it. Well, that's a good definition of success. It's an architectural definition of success actually, because if you succeed properly, then your success benefits everyone else so hard to imagine that there could be anything particularly wrong with that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:06       Alright, so

Speaker 2:          00:53:09       that's the mythological element. Now I want to tell you a little bit about the shamonic element.

Speaker 1:          00:53:14       Now

Speaker 2:          00:53:17       the reason I want to talk to you about shamanism is because shamanism is a very, very old phenomena and Sharmin isn't. Looks like a phenomenon that involves the dramatization of transformation processes, so so one transformation process might be the initiation of young men. Now it's more typical for young men to be initiated. Then young women and no one really knows why that is, except men seem to be able to go more spectacularly wrong than women so well, so if you look at what we'll talk about that later, but there's also competing theories that say you don't have to initiate women because nature does that all by itself and I think that that's not a particularly bad way of looking at it. So women are going to be confronted with the brute force of nature, but men can either do that or not do it, and so there's in some sense an element of choice.

Speaker 2:          00:54:12       And so the initiation rituals take away the element of choice. And so on a typical initiation ritual, what happens is that young men usually at the onset of puberty or taken away from their familial dependents, which really means their mothers and then they're put into some situation and terrified three quarters to death. Now more or less, they do that voluntarily. So perhaps here's an example, maybe you're 13. So remember, think about your 30. Think about that. Okay? And so you're still afraid of the dark when you're 13, even though they'll tell people that you aren't, but you are. And so like if you were dropped naked in the middle of a forest when you're 13 and it's midnight, you're going to be plenty frozen with terror and a good thing too, because you know it's dangerous out there. Okay? So then you think, well maybe it's just a park, but you're still out there and it's dark and you're afraid.

Speaker 2:          00:55:01       You might say, well, what are you afraid of? And one of the things you might come up with as well, you're afraid of what you're imagining. And then you might say, well, does that mean that you're afraid of your imagination or are you afraid of the things your imagination represents? Well, you kind of have to think if there's no actual objective danger there, then what you're afraid of is your imagination. Now, did you guys ever see the Blair witch project? How many of you have seen that? How many of you haven't now? So it's a pretty lousy example. Anyways, it's a horror movie now there's kind of two kinds of horror movies. There's the splatter type horror movie and I think actually those expose you to discuss and then there's the fear kind of horror movie and that doesn't need to have any Gore at all. It just makes you afraid.

Speaker 2:          00:55:50       And the Blair witch project is very good example of that because all that happens, nothing happens, nothing happens, but you think something terrible is going to happen every second and the sense that something terrible is going to happen keeps climbing through the whole movie. And so what they do is put you in a state of radical uncertainty and never let you off. Okay, well so basically they're playing with your imagination and that can work very effectively, like it's often horror movies, often more effective if they don't show you what's making those horrible noises off screen, you know, because no matter what show you, the probability that he can be as personally horrible as what are their monsters you're dredging up out of your imagination is very low. So, and you know, it's reasonable to be afraid of the dark because throughout our biological history, lots of unfortunate people were devoured by things in the dark or hurt very badly by them, etc.

Speaker 2:          00:56:43       Etc. And wE're also daytime creatures, right? So we don't like the dark very much. So what do you do to someone if you're going to initiate them is maybe you take them when they're 13 and you put them in a really dark cave and caves. There Are so dark man, like if you're in a cave, you just can't believe how dark it is. It's, it's, you can't see anything in a cave. So you don't know how big the space you're in is and you don't know how small it is and you don't know whether or not it's going to collapse or when it's going to stay up and you don't know how far you are underground, especially if the people who took you there didn't, you know, walk you around in circles and didn't let you know where you were going and then maybe they leave and maybe they leave for three days.

Speaker 2:          00:57:27       And so you're sitting down there thinking, well, what are you thinking? Exactly? Well, you're thinking the most horrible thoughts you could possibly imagine, right? I'm never going to get out of here. They're never going to find me again. some horrible snake thing that lives in the darkness is going to come and eat it slowly because fast would be merciful and I'm. And then I'm also going to go completely out of my mind so that even if something doesn't eat me, I'm going to come over here and it will be worse than being dead anyways. And so partly what you're doing in that circumstances, you're facing that demons of your own imagination.

Speaker 2:          00:58:04       And if you can stand that, then you grow up and that's what an initiation ceremony tests. Now a lot of what you'll find if you look at clinical theories of psychology, the same motif applies if you want to get better, you have to find out what you're avoiding and what you're afraid of and maybe what you're disgusted by evil and you have to expose yourself to that voluntarily and you have to let that change you. And so it's not a pleasant prospect. I mean, it's not dancing through a field of daisies, right? With muzak play and it'S not follow your bliss. You know, it's not the natural unfolding of a positive process. It's not that at all. It's the voluntary confrontation with the things that make up life's horrors. But what's interesting about it is that there's, there's an idea there that lurks under the surface architecturally, and that is there's a lot more to you than meets the eye, but it won't be released unless it has to.

Speaker 2:          00:59:03       And so you don't have to even figure out what it is until you put yourself in peril. Now, part of that you might think like imagine that you're. You're an introvert. You're socially awkward. You're highly neurotic, so you feel a lot of anxiety and depression. You don't like going to partieS and that's because the horrible tyrant lives at parties and always glaring at you and judging you and telling you how useless and insufficient you are. And so you go there and you don't even look at people because you know that if you did look at them, you just see the face of the judgmental tyrant, which by the way, you wouldn't if you actually looked at them, but you won't because you avoid and so you're going to go there and you're going to put yourself in this terrible situation. And if you're lucky and you're a bit of weight, then you're going to incorporate all sorts of information from the external world that will help you develop your social skills and make you more sophisticated.

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       And even if that doesn't happen, you're going to learn that. You can tolerate your own fear. And you might say, well, what's better to not be afraid or to know that you can handle being afraid and obviously to not be afraid, but give that up because that ain't happening so that the next best thing and the realistic thing is to know that you're the master of your own fear. And so a lot of what we're going to talk about in relationship to classical theories of personality is exactly that. It's not that the world isn't terrible, is that the world is terrible, but you're a lot stronger than you think and the way you. Okay? And so part of that is the strength that you gather is partly the information that you gather when you go somewhere that you're not good at. You know, so you're establishing new skills like you haven't university.

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       But there's another part that's interesting that's related to the little video that I showed you at the beginning. Dna turns out to be a very complex structure. And so if I put you in situation a, then dna codes, certain kinds of proteins that help make up the way that your mind is in the way it works. But if I take you and put you in another situation, completely different genes turn on, and so what that means is that you have a biological repository of potential use lying dormant at the highest resolution level of your molecular structure. And then if you push yourself and all sorts of different directions and you find different things to pursue and test yourself against, then you're going to turn on parts of yourself that aren't currently on and god only knows what you'd be like if you turned yourself completely on. Maybe I could use a better metaphor.

Speaker 2:          01:01:47       I'll tell you a little bit more about the shavano routines because they're more, you know, if there is a initiation archetype which are kind of just described to you, which is you can do this to yourself. I'll Tell you, oh yeah, and this is a good way to live. It beats the alternative. anyone? So which is like the definition of a good way to live so mad and you're trying to pursue something so you've got a goal. That's a good thing. You got to have a goal and you don't want to hold onto that too tightly because he might be wrong. You've got to be willing to let that go and have a different goal, but you need to go and then you know while you're pursuing the goal, you're gonna. Find out that there's some obstacles in your path obviously, and maybe some of those obstacles are of a frightening time, or maybe they're even have a disgusting type.

Speaker 2:          01:02:27       You might say, I don't want to turn into that kind of person, so those of you who are sort of socialist utopia, left wingers might think that way about business people. It's like, I would, I would recommend that you get over it as rapidly as possible. So anyways, you might think there's no way I'm going to act that way. So you sort of put it off limits saying, or maybe you're afraid to do what you need to do next. Well, here's the rule. Don't avoid doing things because they make you feel negative emotion. If you have to do those things in order to pursue your goals, in fact, you should do exactly the opposite. So let's say you're pursuing a goal and you find that you're afraid about something and so you're avoiding it. The first thing you should think is a hot look. I'm afraid of something and I'm avoiding it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:12       Dragon treasure. Exactly there. And that's exactly right. It's precisely right. If you're. If you're afraid of the thing, then what that means is that you're not developed enough to handle it and you need to be. So you should think about that as a discovery, like a positive discovery. You found out where you have a weakness and you're now able to address it. So you know if you're an introvert and you think it's friday night, I could go to this party, but you know I really don't want to. Then you think, oh, that means I should go. And that's exactly right because

Speaker 2:          01:03:50       because you already know how to do the things that you know how to do and it's the things that you don't know how to do that bother you and oppress you. And of course those things are going to be difficult to learn about, but you need to learn about them because you need to get yourself all switched on. How's that switched on? Because then you'll be able to tolerate the fact that life is fundamentally suffering and so you don't know. The world doesn't get safer us. You developed, in fact quite the contrary. You just get more competent and that's better anyways because it's conceivable that you don't want safety anyways. You probably want adventure. You probably want to be compelled. You probably want to be engaged. You know, if you want security, you might as well be dead well because nothing's happening then and that there's no danger to be alive is to be contending with the world and you want to be the best you can possibly be. And that's partly what we're going to learn about as we go through the entire course. But certainly the elements that have to do with clinical psychology because all of them circulate around this fundamental fee. They have to. Because it's the fundamental story of mankind and we want to know what that fundamental story is because we're all human and you need to know the story and then you know, you can decide how you're going to act it out, but at least you need to know the damn story first. So we'll see you.
