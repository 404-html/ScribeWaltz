Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Okay, so we're actually going to take a step back. Historically, doctor both Carl Rogers last time as a phenomenologist, so we started our brief foray into the ideas behind phenomenology, but now we're going to go back in time and VIP and we're going to talk about the end of the 19th century and we're going to discuss Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and character guard in some detail and the reason we're going to do that is because those three men, I, I would say more than anyone else in the 19th century, laid the groundwork not only for what would become psychoanalysis and then later personality psychology and clinical psychology, but they also describe the broader social, political and cultural situation that modern people find themselves in now and their thought is exceedingly sophisticated and it's really worth grasping. Because if you can get it, you know we're going through these personality theories one of the time and we're making going to make forays into biology and neuro psychology.

Speaker 1:          00:01:18       You need a structure underneath that. You need to understand a structure that's underneath all of that to slot everything into. Because that way you can understand it in more detail and so partly because ideas develop historically and also as an idea, as a seed and the seed, other plants grow and so forth and the plant grows and so forth and branches off. If you can get back down to the origin point, then you can often understand the entire structure more straightforwardly and also these three men are so brilliant that it's a joy to encounter their thinking even though it's very, very subversive. Seriously diverse. So we're gonna start with this diagram which you will remember. So okay. You're so think about this from the pit of perspective, like we made the point that as the child puts itself, let's say together, it starts by practicing micro routines, micro molder, routines, and those are accompanied by perceptual frameworks and also they're incorporated into a motivational value system because they're motivated actions and then the child practices sequencing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       Those micro personalities will say together to make ever more and more complex and ever more and more integrated macro personalities. And so that's basically what this diagram describes. We were looking at it from an adult perspective. So you know if you're going to be a good person, you can decompose being a good person into sub of being a good person and you can decode it, so being a good person is an abstract ideal, but as you move closer and closer to the point where the goodness is manifested in action, you move closer and closer to actual movements in the world and so the abstract category good person is actually made out of. You can think about it as a very complex melody of motor motor actions and perceptions. Perception is very tightly linked to motor action because whenever you perceive anything, you're doing it in part by actively investigating world is partly why your eyes are moving around all the time and if you're listening, you move your head and touch something.

Speaker 1:          00:03:37       You have to actively investigate it. So it's always an activity of exploration. Now in some ways when you think about the child piecing, it's. It's being together from the bottom up. You can think about that as a biological process unfolding. You know, and you can take up the child is crawling and then learning to walk as a biological process unfolding, but that's an oversimplification because human beings exist from day one in a very, very social world. And so what that means is the way that those behaviors are sub micro personalities start to organize themselves is always under the influence of, of the society in which they're embedded. And so, you know, Piaget talked about the child as, as, as being, uh, as, as having reflex basic built in reflex is at birth, and that, that, those reflexes are then elaborated up into more and more complex structures.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       But you can think that even the elaboration of those basic reflexes, even right from the beginning, like there's a routing and sucking reflex, which you can, you can listen from a child by tapping on the side of it's cheap when it's very new, newly born and it'll search to try to put what's tapping in its mouth. And that's, that's a, that's part of the reflection process. The built in perceptual motor unit that allows the child to begin to cycle. Now the thing is though, what it suckling isn't a static and objective entity, it's a person and part of breastfeeding is the establishment of a relationship, a complex relationship, because it's also not only a feeding relationship, it's a caring relationship. It's a relationship that's based on tactile interaction. There can be nervousness associated with it. Uh, and, and often is, especially for a new mother, it's a very complex, dynamic social act.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       And so what that means is that right from the beginning, in order for the baby to engage in that process properly, it has to allow its initial reflexive movements to be modified by social necessity immediately. So for example, if a baby is breastfeeding, it can't bite and you know, it doesn't have any teeth. So being isn't necessarily a catastrophe, but it's not pleasant. And so what will happen if the baby bites the mother is that the mother will pull away and startle the baby and then the baby will cry and you know, the father will be at least startled by the, by the error. And so the baby has to learn to you. It has to learn to be civilized in some sense. Right off the bat. Now you know when Freud was talking about the process of socialization, he tended to concentrate more on toilet training.

Speaker 1:          00:06:26       No, because he thought of that as the first place were the first major place where the ID of the child, which which or which Rogers would regard as an organismic as the organismic. A experiential domain is brought under control of the superego. Right? Because of the baby. Obviously it's fundamental biological function is to relieve itself, but that has to come under very, very strict social control and it's a. it's a complex form of learning which basically the acquisition of voluntary control over what was here too for an involuntary reflex essentially, and so that can go well or it can go badly and it can very well go very badly. So I knew a family who had a daughter at one point and that daughter would only dedicate in her diaper when she was three. So that meant she had full of voluntary control of her bowel function, but there was no way she was going to participate in the social ritual that surrounded proper toilet.

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       There was a war going on like a serious war and that sort of thing happens while not infrequently. And of course you remember in the crumb movie, the mother, the boys accusing the mother of giving them enemas and her of course denying that any such thing happened, which was something that made both of them roll their eyes, you know, and they all laughed, but it's really not particularly amusing. So anyways, my point is is that even at the micro level, the manifestation of what we'll call micro personalities expands and organizes into an environment that's conditioned by social expectation. Okay. So then then, and this is something we haven't talked about before, one thing you might ask is, okay, where does the social expectation come from? Now that's a very complex question because in some sense that's the same question as that as where does culture come from?

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       And that's partly a complex question because you have to take into account evolutionary history which provides the substrata for the development of culture. So that would be human biology of take that into account and then you have to take human history into account and, and we're what you don't have to take into account is not clear, right? Because it's very difficult to, to track the origins of the social routines that make up the fundamental social contract. You know, we know how to behave properly. Roughly speaking. We have a set of expectations and a set of wants for about the way that other people are going to behave with regards to us. And they returned the favor and everyone is participating in this and everybody basically knows, unless they're very poorly socialized, you can usually tell that right away. You know, kids can tell that because if a three year old is playing with another three year old and one of them is poorly socialized and so maybe has the behavioral repertoire of a fairly badly behaved two year old.

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       The other three year old being socially sophisticated will say, will not play with the first one, so even though they might be perfectly happy to play for a time with an actual two year old, so it doesn't take very long. It's really about the age of three. The children are already sophisticated enough to have embodied the rules that constitute appropriate cultural behavior and those rules are there patterns actually for the exactly rules for the child because the child couldn't explicitly state them, but they can act them out. Now you remember now, Piaget talked about this a fair bit, right? Because he said that part of the way that the slightly larger micro personality say have a two year old are integrated into the broader social world is through games that are played with peers and with older children and the games are ways that like a game is fundamentally a negotiated.

Speaker 1:          00:10:22       It's a negotiated sphere of action and perception that has a particular goal and the goal is defined by the players and the sphere of interaction is defined by the players. And so then if you're a good player, what happens is that you become part of a higher order structure and the hierarchy structure is the game. So if you're playing soccer, all of a sudden if you're civilized, what you do is you manifest those behaviors that are appropriate to play soccer and you subordinate your voluntarily subordinate, your individuality at that point to the higher order structure of the game. That's a communal agreement. So it's a basic social contract. And so you practice being part of basic social contracts by playing games. And you can do that with games that are in some sense relatively straightforward and regulated by strict conventions and articulated rules. And so that would be like a soccer game or you can do it in a more complex way and a less, a less, a less structured and less articulated manner by engaging in dramatic play.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       And so what children usually do when they're doing that is that they'll gather around a little group and they'll, they'll lay out the drama. So drama would be, we're going to simulate x, we're going to simulate a family. And then everybody is assigned a role and so you're supposed to act out your role, but exactly how you're supposed to act it out is left open during the games so you can riff and improvise and basically what children are doing when they're doing that is acting out the family and you know, because they need to get the family in their bones. Because being a parent isn't a set of ideas about parenting. It's a set of behaviors. It's a dance that you learn to have with your children and with your partner. And it's very complicated and the rules go far beyond what you could ever articulate, you know, because you can ask yourself a question like, well, how should you discipline a child?

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       Well, first of all, you can argue about that forever, but second of all, you cannot actually elaborate a set of principles that will guide your behavior in every situation where a child is likely to disrupt the social circumstance. So you have to be smarter than you can say in order to be good at doing something as complicated as disciplining a child. Now, because discipline also means encouraging, right? Because it's part of discipline as well, you shouldn't do those things, but another part of it is you should definitely do more of those things and so it's the inculcation of a moral code and a lot of that's done through nonverbal behavior and through providing a role model for spontaneous invitation and all sorts of things that aren't verbal. Okay. Now, so, so piaget talked about the game and then you could take the games become more and more complex and more and more abstract and more and more like real life as you mature until they.

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       They may be the games transform into what sociologists would refer to as roles. So the role you're playing at the moment that at least in principle is student and you know it's a game and it's a game because it's a fiction in some sense, you know, it's a fiction. It's a dramatic fiction in some sense. The only reason that it exists as a role is because society is structured in such a way that enables. This too enables you to do what you're doing and to live at the same time. So it's not exactly how to outpatient to the normal, to the natural world in any sense of the in any sense of the word, but it's also, it's also real life or maybe it's almost as close to real life as you ever get because almost everything that modern people do, and maybe this is true for a long time into the past, his game like in its structure, so the game's just get more and more and more.

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       There's more and more and more encompassing in some sense. But you can, you can almost. You can almost say that it never comes to the point where what you're doing is no longer playing the game. Now that's a bit of an oversimplification, but because there are games and games, but we won't talk about the games at the moment. Okay. So now you can understand sort of some of the lower order games and you can even understand some of the higher order roles. Like you, you could basically articulate in some sense what it means to be a student. But if you go up the hierarchy, you know, because good person, a subset of good person could be good student. You can kind of articulate what it means to be a good student, although you can't fully articulate it, but if you go at levels above that, like be a good citizen or be a good person, but gets more and more difficult to fully articulate because of course it's more and more abstract and in encompasses more and more territory and so by the time you're at the top of the hierarchy, so to speak, be a good person.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       Well, it's much. It's a much more complex phenomena than you can articulate. It can't be fully articulated. Now I want to read you something that Nisha said.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       Now you have to listen to this carefully because there's some very interesting things about the way nature writes. He's writes a for forest, an need for Islam is a short statement. Often only a sentence, but more typically a paragraph. Next, very, very densely packed with ideas and I think you could say in some sense that if you read Nietzsche, the stuff that I'm going to read right now is from beyond good and evil that every single sentence has an idea in it and it's often an original idea and that's a remarkable accomplishment. I mean I've often gone through books and marked. I usually fold the top of the page over mark where I think there is an idea worth keeping. It's an idea I haven't run into before. So it's an original idea and I would say in a typical book I read there's none of them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       There might be one or two, but with nature there's probably 20 on a page and so it makes it, it, it, it's. He's packed a tremendous amount of information into a very, very small space and one of the things and he tried to do that and there was a bunch of reasons. One was his health wasn't very good, although he was an early stage genius. He was a full professor in Germany, I think when he was 22 or 23, which is impossible because if you don't become a full professor, especially 130 years ago, 140 years ago in a German University at the age of 23, it just isn't possible, but he was a spectacular genius, but his health failed him and so he had a very difficult time writing and so what he did was spending an awful lot of time thinking and a very short period of time writing.

Speaker 1:          00:17:25       And so what that meant was that he would take a tremendous amount of thought, genius level thought and then compress it into like a single sentence or a single paragraph in and he said that he liked to philosophize with a hammer and in some sense, you know now you know about hierarchy that I just showed you. You know, we talked about the idea that if you hit something disruptive in your life, that the magnitude of your response is proportionate to the, to the elevation of the level. Right? It's much more damaging to be accused of being a bad person. You know, seriously, than it is for someone to complain about, you know which side of the plate you happen to put the forecourt. So and I think you can say that you can sort of think of those nested hierarchies of value as nested hierarchies of.

Speaker 1:          00:18:16       They're almost like maps in the sense there their little units of things, ways that you know how to maneuver in the world and not in. What that means is that as you go up the hierarchy, the map is larger and larger and more comprehensive and so if you blow out someone's map of which fork to put on the table, that's not so bad. They can just rectify that in no time flat. It leaves 99 point nine, nine percent of their personality and tech. But if you fail a crucial exam for it, for example, and part of the reason that you're going to fit your a student is because you want to go to medical school. You know that'll blow out like 50 or 60 percent of your personality. Or at least it'll feel that way. And that's because what's happening is that the structure that you use to regulate the relationship between you and the world has become damaged at a high level.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       And that invalidates, like if you're not a student, if you're not a good student anymore than all of the sub factors that make up being a good student might be invalid. And you know, you might've put a lot of effort into being a good student. And so if all of a sudden you're not that, you have to ask yourself, well, what exactly am I and where are all the errors? And that's a very, that can be a, well that's an extraordinary difficult cognitive problem because you've built that structure who knows, you know, over what period of time it might be 15 years or something like that. And you'd be practicing building that structure and it's a huge part of your identity because someone might say, well, what are you even? And you'd say a student, you know, they might say, what do you do? But they could easily say, what are you?

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       I'm a student. While if you're not a student at least in so far as you desire to find student, then just exactly what are you. All right. So nature, you know, when he packed a lot of information into a sentence or a paragraph, you have to be very careful reading him and young is like this too because he'll throw some information if you that's packed into a paragraph and it'll be the kind of information that disrupts high level structures. You won't even notice it, but because it's so subversive and he, he wanted to do that. It was the name of his. He had his reasons to do it. He would say that you have to be broken down to nothing before you can be rebuilt. So it's like a trip to the underworld thing. So, and I suppose in many ways that's what philosophy is.

Speaker 1:          00:20:36       You know, it's, you don't learn a new principal without allowing old principles to disappear because you can't have the new principal and the old principal at the same time. So almost always any radical learning involves the destruction of old habits and have action and perception. And that's, that's a kind of death, like it's a, it's a, it's an abstract death, you know, but at that doesn't make it not painful. And the thing is, if the abstract is of sufficient intensity, it can drive people to suicide because they regard killing themselves as easier than making the reparation, you know, facing the anxiety and the suffering and going through the intolerably difficult task of retooling and they may well regard that as more emotionally threatening then death. And so and that, that's not that rare, you know, I mean, suicide is rare, but it's not that rare.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       So you know, and it certainly a behavior that everyone is. I suspect everyone here has known someone who was touched by suicide in some way, you know, it might not be your family member or even your extended family member, but the probability that you know, someone who knows someone who committed suicide is extremely, extremely likely. So Nietzsche is a very dangerous, dangerous thinker. I'm the only person I know who kind of approaches him and not regard as young. And Yoga is actually less troublesome because a lot of what does the NSBE offers is his destruction. It's intelligent, brilliant destruction, but he doesn't really offer a solution. He's sort of sketches out the possibilities of a solution and he died young and then in many ways what happened was that young picked up where [inaudible] left off and tried to solve the problems that need you left unsolved, so it was nature, for example, in some sense, along with Dostoevsky who really definitively announced the death of God at the end of the 19th century in that left people in some ways bereft of belief, and we're going to talk about why that's so important in a moment.

Speaker 1:          00:22:40       What union was doing was trying to. Well, he was trying to rescue the farther from the underworld in the sense he was trying. He tried to go back to the religious traditions that Nietzsche had had described as fatally anachronistic and demolished by the claims of science. He attempted to go back to those religious traditions and reassess them from a psychological perspective to pull back the necessary meaning that was embedded in them so that people could reunite with their culture and in principle not be so prone to pathological belief systems like ideology that tend to rush in where there's a gap. You know, a niche has said very clearly and and Dostoevsky knew this as well by the end of the 19th century, is that the death of God would mean that people would turn on Mohs to rationalistic ideologies and that would be murderous. They knew that was coming and that's an amazing prediction, really is amazing prediction.

Speaker 1:          00:23:34       It just shows you how thoroughly they understood the structure. Okay, so I'm going to read you something by nature and then we're going to return to the hierarchy so that you can kind of understand something deeper about the way the hierarchy is structured. Okay? Now he's talking about philosophical ideas here and he's actually talking about articulated ethics. So one way that you might think about philosophy is that philosophers or originate articulated moral principles, and that is often the way that people think about especially moral philosophy. It's like it's the philosophers who come up with the ideas, but that isn't what needs you believe. Here's what he said. Instead, separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or autonomously evolving.

Speaker 1:          00:24:24       They grow up in connection and relationship with each other. However, suddenly an arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought. They nevertheless belong just as much to assist them as the collective members of the fauna of a continent. Okay? So it's a very interesting idea. So the first idea that he's putting forward is that you could. The best way to think about a philosophical system, say a philosophical system of ethics is as if it's different statements are animals related to one another in an ecosystem. So he has a biological metaphor in some sense, for, for, for the emergence of a philosophical system. It's quite an interesting way of thinking, of course, and it makes sense because if a philosophical system of ethics, which is a philosophical system that tells you how and why you should behave a certain way is about how you should act and you're a biological being, then of course, it only makes sense that the concepts themselves which are guides to actions, can logically be considered biological entities. They're abstracted biological entities, but they still have the same nature as biological entities and that means according to meet you, that they're subject to the same rules. Now, this is the sort of place where he foreshadows Freud deeply, so

Speaker 1:          00:25:46       nature says

Speaker 1:          00:25:49       they never little last belong just as much to assist them as the collective members of the forerunner of a continent. This is be treated in the end by the circumstance. However, unfailingly, the most diverse philosophers always fill in, again, a definite fundamental schema. Possible philosophies under an invisible spell. They always resolved once more in the same orbit. However, independent of each other, they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills. Something within them leads them something impels them indefinite order. The one after the other to wit the innate methodology in relationship of their ideas, their thinking is in fact far less a discovery then direct than a rerecognition, a remembering a return and a homecoming to a far off ancient common household of the soul out of which these ideas formerly group philosophizing so far, it kind of activism of the highest order. Okay, so here, here's the idea. There's, there's two fundamental ideas that are embedded in this, which actually neat. You differentiates. Alright, I'm going to read you another section that illuminates the first one.

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       It's gradually became clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of namely the confession of its originator and a species of involuntary and unconscious autobiography and moreover that the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown. Okay? So this is a very radical statement. So because what Nietzsche is saying is that philosophies, even when they declare themselves rational, are deeply personal and they're also necessarily embedded within a motivational structure that is either pro or anti life, something like that. So there's no value free philosophizing. What there is is the expression of biologically and culturally conditioned being which is conditioned by let's say, the same sort of fundamental forces that Freud described in the in the in the biological realm, and then that's conditioned by the cultural processes that we just discussed in relationship to piaget and then what the philosopher does is observe that all of those things are happening.

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       Allow that to be articulated and confuse that with his own thought. That's a brilliant idea. Now here's a way of thinking about it. Now, one of the things Piaget said was that once children start to play games, when they're young, collective games, you can watch the children play the collective games like maybe eight kids are playing marbles or something like that, and then you can take the young kids out of the game and you can ask them what the rules are. And what will happen is you'll get a diverse set of diverse and paradoxical set of articulated rules. And what that means is that the children can play the game when they're in the game and we're in there in the context of all the other people because in some sense the game is embedded in pieces in all of them and as long as they're all there, that all works.

Speaker 1:          00:29:18       But if you pull the child the way they don't have the intellectual wherewithal to do, describe the patterns of behavior that make up the game. And that's only to say that they know things that they can't say because you might say, well, the game, the rules of the game come first and then the game emerges. But that's wrong. It's the game comes first. And only after that do the rules emerge. And of course there's, you know, there's a reciprocal relationship between them because once the rules are somewhat articulated, then the game becomes more structured, you know, and, and, and the rules can become more structured and so on. So the articulation changes the rules. What niche you is saying is the same thing applies to societies. He says like in so far as you can consider society, a collective game played by millions of people over vast spans of time.

Speaker 1:          00:30:07       It's a game of games in some sense, and it emerged from the bottom up. It emerged out of biological impulses and an interpersonal and social interactions, conditioning and shaping everyone's behavior and perception, and that happened way before anyone could articulate what those rules were. Now you remember when Nisha was writing, there was no real sense of how old the earth was or how old the universe was mean. People thought even the radical people thought maybe in terms of hundreds of thousands of years, you know, and now we know that the universe is 14 billion years old and that the earth is 4 billion years old and that life has been plentiful on the earth for three point 5 billion years. You know, so that the historical context within which we've originated has expanded by, by orders of magnitude since the last 19th century. And so then what you think that means is that the way that our games have been organized stretches impossibly back in time.

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       Now I already told you I believe the story about lobster dominance, higher fees, right, so even lobsters that's 400 million years ago, lobsters arrayed themselves in a social space and they regulate each other and that means the lobsters essentially have a lobster society and you know, each lobster has biological predispositions that are quite determined. They're quite a. The lobster is quite a deterministic creature, but nonetheless, the way that those biological predispositions manifest themselves is conditioned and shaped by the social surrounding. And so you think, well, lobsters start to play games for a hundred million years ago and you know, as we've taken the tremendously long evolutionary journey across that time, we'd been playing social games the whole time. And that means that the way that we interacted with each other has evolved and it's even shaped the way our biology manifests itself because that's how we'll culture is. And then out of that, as we became more capable of abstraction.

Speaker 1:          00:32:20       And maybe that's, you know, that's something that really took off probably 7 million years ago with modern human beings emerging about 150,000 years ago because we separated from the common ancestor of peep of human beings in chimpanzees about 7 million years ago. You can tell that by doing analysis of genetic differences. So the brain expanded very rapidly after that point and our culture became more and more conscious and articulated and complex and larger and more technological, you know, so it became in some ways more dependent on social norms and less dependent on deterministic biological predispositions. But we've still been doing that for a very long time. There's, there's good evidence that, um, you know, we started using fire about 2 million years ago. And uh, forgive me if I told you this already, but you know, if you look at a human being and you look at a champion z one, there's a bunch of things you see that are very different.

Speaker 1:          00:33:14       Morphologically, the chimp is much shorter, much, much wider and way more powerful. So like a normal mail chimp is about six times as strong as the strongest Olympic athlete. So don't mess with chimps. They'll tear you apart, they're really, really strong and dangerous. So. But the chimp is shaped sort of like this. No, they have a huge gastrointestinal system, roughly speaking, and the reason for that is mostly what they eat is leaves and leaves, have no caloric content, and so they have to eat immense numbers of leaves and leaves are hard to digest so they have to chew them like mad. So the typical chimps sits around eight hours a day, chewing, and then they have this tremendously long gastrointestinal system because it takes that long to extract any nutrients out of out of leaves. While we circumvented that man, as soon as we invented fire and fire allowed us to outsource our digestion because if you cook most things, vegetables, but more importantly meet.

Speaker 1:          00:34:15       If you cook them, they become much more bioavailable and, and it takes much less energy to digest them. So that way you can shrink your gut and grow your brain. And so that's apparently what we did because here we are, you know, relatively slim at least compared to chimpanzees and so fire popped up 2 million years ago. It's a real cultural revolution, but you know, that's so old, that culture revolution, that content completely reshaped our bodies. And so this interplay between biology and culture, it's been going on for an unimaginably long period of time. And it conditions everything we do. Now here's a complicated idea.

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       Okay, so imagine a wolf pack. Now. Wolf pack is a pretty complex, complicated social group. It's, it's a fair bit like a primordial human group, which is why dogs have been with us for 25,000 years. Maybe they were walls that first started to follow us around. And scabies, or more likely, I think someone went out, some primordial hunter, went out hunting, killed a wolf female, found the pops and one home for the children to play with, you know. And that was the origin, the origin of the dog. I think it was something like that because dogs are basically, they're basically genetically identical with wolves. Now the thing is is we can get along with dogs and the reason we can get lauren with dogs, because dogs have a social organization, you could call it a dominance hierarchy. That's a fair bit like the Human Social Organization and so you can see that part of what it means to be human is the same thing that it means to be a pack animal like a dog or a pack animal, like our domesticated horses and cows for example, which we can domesticate partly because there are social.

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       So some of the structure of our social organization is the same sort of structure that an animal dominance hierarchy has like a chimpanzee dominance hierarchy for example. And so we know that chimpanzees and other primates, monkeys for example, are acutely aware of the levels of hierarchy in their social structure. And there are, I think it's vervet monkeys. This is a very funny experiment. So imagine that the top vervet monkeys are like celebrity monkeys, you know, and the bottom vervet monkeys are like, you know, dissolute street people. And so then you take some pictures of dissolute street people who are just at the bottom of the hierarchy and you take some pictures of celebrities and you show pictures to a human audience, and the human audience will look at the celebrities longer. Well, if you take the vervet monkeys and you take photographs of the top ranking vervet monkeys and the bottom vervet monkeys, and you showed them to vervet monkeys than the vervet monkeys will look at the top ranking Verdun Vervet, monkey photographs more than the bottom ranking vervet monkey photographs.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       So in some sense, they're transfixed by the individuals who are higher up in the in the social order. And that makes sense, right? Because what you should feel, especially in a fairly aggressive dominance hierarchy, what you should feel, the closer you are to the bottom of the dominance hierarchy, the closer what you should feel for whatever's at the top of the dominance hierarchy. That should be. It should be closer and closer to all. Now, when people feel off, they get chills running up and down their back, their neck, well white. The reason that happens is because it's an. It's an, it's an activism. It's a hangover from the time that when you were threatened by something awe inspiring, let's say a snake or a bear or something like that, your hair would stand up and the reason for that is so that you look bigger and you still see this happening all the time with cats right to capsule.

Speaker 1:          00:38:06       Normally cat's face each other this way, right? But if they start to fight, they turned sideways and that so they each look bigger than they puff up their fur and their tail and that's to show the other cat that they're really a lot bigger than the cat first thought. Now, of course they're both doing that so it's a little bit pointless, but they're just cat. So you know you can give them a break, but the point is is that the pilot will erect and that's the same thing that happens. For example, when you're listening to very powerful music and it deeply affects you and you get chills. It's like the hair stands up on the back of your neck and that's the signaling of all. Now the reason you should feel odd to award something that's higher up in the dominance hierarchy is because that thing has power like is there.

Speaker 1:          00:38:48       Well, there's more than one reason a that thing has power. You better be careful of it because it will put you in your place and fast and part of the reason the dominance hierarchy exists is so that everybody knows their place and they don't have to be reminded of it by being half killed on a regular basis. You know, so maybe your nine on a scale of one, one being the top, maybe your number nine, it's not so good, but number nine and not hurting, there's a lot better than number nine in lying there bleeding on the ground. And so what happens with dominance hierarchies is they usually arrange themselves in part by power, but by no means only empower. Everybody knows where they are and pretty much everybody stays there and not even happens over multiple generations saying in, in complex primate dominance, trues statuses heritable so, and you know that there's not much of a leap between that. Inheritable monitor peace among human beings. It's a reflection of, you know, it's much more complex among human beings because it's articulated in structure, but it's the same basic thing. Now. Niches point was so now imagine in that. Now here's another problem. So imagine that,

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       okay, so you've got a garment, it's art and it's fairly stable and one of the things you want to do is climb to the top of the dominant Turkey. And the reason you want to do that, there's all sorts of reasons. High quality mates, that's the primary reason that's particular true in humans. If you're male, because males are much more differential reproducers that females, which means a lot of males fail to reproduce completely and some reproduce a lot. Whereas the typical woman reproduces at least some. So that means competition is more intense among men. And that's part of the reason why dominance hierarchies tend to be tilted towards male power because competition means more to them. The outcome is more crucial. So now part of what happens is that as people compete within the dominance hierarchy, what they're doing is to try to figure out who it is that is fit to be on top.

Speaker 1:          00:41:01       Now you might think that that's a matter of power, you know, in fact, your basic social lefty, social constructionists would have you believe that that was all there is to it, is that the whole dominance hierarchy is nothing but a power system. And the people on top are there because they have power and what's there is power. And by that they mean the ability to enforce their will on other people. Well, that's a, that's a dopey theory. And the reason for that is, is that if unit dimensional, you know, we, that people are multifaceted, there's no single motivation. That's king. You know, for Freud it was sex and aggression and like if you're going to come up with a couple of potent candidates, those are two. But there's lots of other ones. People are playful and play as a primary biological circuit. You know, we suffer, we're hungry, we're thirsty, we're affiliative.

Speaker 1:          00:41:54       Like there's a lot of biological necessity driving the makeup of our personalities and there are biological subpersonalities into arbitrarily call one of them. The source of something as complex as social organization is, it's a. it's, it's a, it's a false form of monotheism. It's a crazy idea and it's the kind of idea that only people who really don't like to think would have. Because once you come up with that idea, it's all power. You don't have to think anymore. Someone can say to you, well, why is complex phenomena x the way it is? Why is the economy arranged the way it is? Well, it's so that the people at the top can maintain their power. Well, yeah, sure, but maybe that accounts for 10 percent of the reason it doesn't get close to 100 percent. There's lots of reasons why hierarchies are structured the way they are, and sheer physical force is one of them, but it's.

Speaker 1:          00:42:55       It's unstable. So. So Frans de Waal, who was watching chimps organize their dominance hierarchies in the zoo in Holland, noted quite quickly that it was fairly typical or at least possible for the meanest, ugliest, strongest mail chimp to be the dominant guide. Sometimes it was the chip who learned to pick up a garbage cameron who act the hell out of it with the stick because that intimidated his enemies, you know, so it's a bit of creativity, creativity there, but what, but what they found was that the stable hierarchies were never run by barbarian chimp dictators. And the reason for that was that coalitions of other males would take them out because you know, you think, well, if you're, if you're one of antisocial aggressive male in endure tough, it's like, okay, you're tough. But three lesser friendlier males who are bound together in a friendship pack, which chimpanzees form quite intensely.

Speaker 1:          00:43:55       It's like as soon as that guy turns his back or has a bad day or gets hurt, they're going to jump in there and tear him to pieces. And that's exactly what happened. So what below found was that the stabler chimpanzee dominance hierarchies were run usually by males who were affiliative and gregarious who remembered their social obligation. So that meant with with regards to their friendship network and who were also very good to the females and the infants in the truth, even if they weren't his. And the idea there is that power is an unstable basis for the maintenance of a dominance hierarchy across time. Because in some sense, even among the chips, you have to have the consent of the governed because you'll get a revolution otherwise. And so you know you're going to get a revolution if you put people in or animals in the situation where they have nothing to lose.

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       And so what that means is there are constraints on how you can act well. You try to move up the dominance hierarchy system because if you're too aggressive and selfish and you're not grooming anyone else and you're not communicating with the other creatures in the truth, they're going to gang up on you and take you down. And so if you're going to maneuver your way up the true, you have to be do it in a manner that civilized enough so that you don't get every one against you. And so what it means is that to maneuver up a power hierarchy, especially a complex power art heartbeat, you have to be a lot more than powerful. So, okay, now, so now we've got this idea that there are principles governing the movement of peep, of creatures up a dominance even among the animals, and one of the defining characteristics of the that, that one of the characteristics that necessity makes the limit, that process is that overtime the truth can't let anybody climb the dominance hierarchy who will destabilize the whole dominance heart.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       Because then that's it. Game over. So at the very least, you have to learn how to climb up the hierarchy so that you don't destabilize it while you climb, because otherwise you get to the top and there's nothing left. Well, and in animals know this, they know this instinctively. So for example, when wolves go at it first, they puff up and they'd grow with each other and they put up their shoulders and like they get more and more aggressive until attack is imminent and often one of them will back off with there's no fighting, no one gets damaged. And, and so that's the typical situation. It's like one says, yeah, okay, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm out of here. And God only knows why that is. Often I suspect the wolf with the higher serotonin level winds because it has less negative emotion. And Sarah Donin levels go up as you move up the dominance art now.

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       And then they'll go into, you know, they'll actually have a fight, but the fight usually doesn't last very long. And then the loser will roll over, throw itch, show its throat to the winter, which is quite a behavior because wolves tear the throats out of, of, of their prey. And the top woeful back off. And you know, you think about, that's unbelievably sophisticated morality. You know there there's echos in there of the New Testament injunction to love your enemy because that's exactly what the wolf is doing and you know it doesn't know this because it can't articulate the rule, but what it's doing is acting as if even the thing that attacked you is valuable in its own right. If it's part of your truth and you know, you can see there the, the, the ancient biological origins of the idea of the, you know, of the, of the equality and value of each individual.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       So these things have deep, deep, deep roots. They're not arbitrary, they're not arbitrary and no one invented them. And that's exactly what Nietzsche is saying here. To understand how the abstruse metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well. And why is to first ask oneself what morality do they or does he aim at? Accordingly? I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy, but that another impulse here as elsewhere has only made use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge as an instrument. But whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as inspiring Jeannie or as demons will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another and that each of them would have only been to glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate lord of over all of the other impulses.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       So what is he saying there? Well, you know, nature makes this explicit in passages that are related to this one. He viewed the human being as a collection of sub souls and the souls were grounded in their existence and in biological underpinnings. And that was the case for every human being in that made us roughly similar. It certainly made our groups roughly similar. And so these, each of these biological subsystems conceptualized as a sub soul was something that had its own viewpoint, has its own rules, had its own games, and they would, they jockey for precedence. Now you know that because sometimes you're sitting there reading and you're trying to concentrate on a higher order goal, like completing your classes. And you know, some biologically determined subsystem pops up and says, you know, this would be an excellent time to go have a coffee, you know, and you might do everything you can to not allow that thing to take over, but often it does.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       And so, and often that's despite what you think you might actually want to do. And then later you're all upset about it because you've procrastinated yet again. But you know, nature view the psyche as a place you could almost think of yourself as a set of apps. It's like your brain is a set of animals and the animals are all dependent on one another, but each animal needs to be boss from time to time. And each animal wants to be boss more often than it should be. And then you know, the higher order critical systems are there to figure out how to sequence all of these other animals so that they all get what they need without interfering with each other across large spans of time in the presence of many other people in a manner that's sustaining. So it's very, very complicated. Okay. Now, so let's go back to the hierarchy so you have the hierarchy and overtime.

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       Now remember, this hierarchy stays there for a very long period of time and remember as well that the people who climbed to the top of the hierarchy are much more likely to leave offspring than the people who don't. And so then what that means is that the hierarchy in part is one of the primary selection forces operating on humanity and what that means is that we evolve towards the thing that can most successfully climbed the dominance heart. And so that means that we evolve towards the thing that has the best probability of ruling properly and that that's not just cultural. It's cultural because it's the continual interplay between cultural and biology. Going back, we'll save 400 million years or more. Okay, now, but it's even more complicated than that. And, and this is one of the things that you have to understand if you really want to understand what niche of meant by the death of God.

Speaker 1:          00:51:29       So because that's his most famous pronouncement, God is dead and we have killed them and we'll never find enough water to wash away the blood now. So he wasn't announcing that in triumph. He was announcing it in terror. Okay, now imagine this. So as human society becomes more complex and as our brains become larger and larger so that we can track larger social organizations and we can organize more complex communities. What happens is that here to for isolated tribes of people come together and then they have to engage in conflict and negotiation and partly what they're in conflict about is what is the way that you should act and what should the values be? Now there's an old mythological idea that the gods fight in heaven to see who is the dominant God. While you can imagine all of these individual tribes, they had their ideals and those were creatures of their imagination, but those were imagined representations of proper behavioral patterns and they saw there was this transcendent 10 super ordinate and so then try bay would come into contact with tried b be and the guards would clash and out of that, and I know the death and destruction that went with it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:47       The two tribes would integrate and maybe that would take hundreds of years and the religious system that sat above that, which was the representation of the dominance hierarchy, would also transform. So you take [inaudible] Bay and you take try b and then you'd take tried c and then you paid try b and they all accumulate across time and, and, and sort out and articulate and represent all of their beliefs. And what happens is that this tribe has a game and this tribe has a game and this tribe has a game. And then if you put all those games together, they tilt so that a metagame emerges out of it. It's, it's like if it's, if it's fortunate, the best of all three games gets put together in a larger game and it, it has to be the best because otherwise it won't work. The thing will fall apart, right?

Speaker 1:          00:53:36       Because if, if, if your family unit isn't functional, it'll disperse, you know, and, and maybe people will die because of it. It has to have the, it has to be iterative, it has to be playable across time without falling apart from internal pressure and without getting wiped notes from the outside. So it's very tightly constrained. So then let's say this happens over tens of thousands of years, we could say, well, it happened in the Middle East because we know that as Mesopotamia came together, for example, it was the aggregation of multiple tribes and all of the Gods of those tribes. And we know the Mesopotamians organized all those gods into one God, his name was Marduk. And that the story that they tell about the aggregation of the gods into one is the story of the gods getting together and voting on which of them should be at the talk.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       And then we know that the Mesopotamian emperor was charged with the responsibility of acting out that taught gone and that that's what made him a good emperor, and he got reminded of that every year at the new year ceremony, he had to tell all the ways that he hadn't been a good Marduk and then he'd get punished for it, and then they would reenact the battle of the gods and recreate this martech character. Okay, so, so you can understand how that might've come about. Now you could say that the idea of that emergent ideal that was not, that wasn't rational, it was the consequence of conflict and cooperation in, in the real world across time. The representations of that were, you know, we might think about them as narrative representations or if they're deep enough, even as an anthology, you could think about those as the, as the soil for which religious presuppositions emerge.

Speaker 1:          00:55:22       And so what happens is that what you have at the top of the dominance hierarchy as your representation of the good person is no different in its totality. Then the idea of the sovereign God that has emerged across thousands and thousands of years of human history, so the whole structure has this thing at the top and it's regarded in imagination as divine. It's the consequence of the represent the consequence of the battle of representations, of morality in imagination across thousands and thousands of years, and that's a reflection of the actual conflict and restructuring of society is across all that time. So then you have this thing at the top, so we could say in the West, in western Europe, that thing at the top is Christ and that's the dying and the dying and dying and revivifying hero. We talked about reasons for that. That's the thing that can go to the underworld and then come back up. Okay, that's at the top. What happens when it disappears? What will turn to Dostoevsky for that?

Speaker 1:          00:56:37       This is from notes from underground, so this is someone who's in the underground and that's where you go when your value systems collapsed. I'm a sick man. I'm a spiteful man. I'm an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my disease and do not know for certain what ails me. I don't consult a doctor for it and never have I ever respect her medicine than doctors. Besides I'm extremely superstitious sufficiently, so to respect medicine. Anyway, I am well educated enough not to be superstitious, but. But I am superstitious. No, I refuse to consult a doctor from spike that you will probably not understand. Well, I understand that though. Of course I can't explain who it is, precisely that I'm more declining in this case. By my spite. I'm perfectly well aware that I cannot pay out the doctors and extract revenge by not consulting them.

Speaker 1:          00:57:35       I know better than anyone that by all this I'm only injuring myself and no one else, but still, if I don't consult a doctor, it's from spiked. My liver is bad. Well, let it get worse. Now he's a civil servant. I low ranting civil servant and he's retired because he got a little bit of inheritance. He says, when petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I sat, I used to grind my teeth at them and I felt intense enjoyment when I succeeded in making anybody unhappy, I almost always succeeded. For the most part. They were all timid people. Of course they were petitioners, but you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite? Well, the whole point that the real standard lay it in the fact that continually even in the moment of the acute spleen, I was inwardly conscious with shame, that I was not only not spiteful, but not even embittered and that I was simply scaring sparrows at random and amusing myself by it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       I was lying when I just said, now that I was a spiteful officials, I was lying from spike. I was simply amusing myself with the petitioners and with the officer and in reality, I never could become spiteful. I was conscious every moment in myself of many very many elements, absolutely opposite to that. I felt them positively swarming in me these opposite elements. I knew that they had been swarming and me my whole life and craving some outlet for me, but I would not let them out, would not let them purposely, purposely would not let them out. He tormented me until I was ashamed. They drove me to convulsions and sick and be at last. At last. How are they sick and me now. You're not fencing gentleman that I'm expressing remorse for something. Now that I'm asking your forgiveness for something, I'm sure you're fancying that however I assure you I do not care if you are. It was not only that I could not become a spiteful. I did not know how to become anything, neither spiteful nor kind. Neither a rascal nor and honest man. Neither hero nor an insect. Now I'm living my life out in my corner, taunting myself with the spike lists and useless constellation that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it's only the fool who becomes anything.

Speaker 1:          01:00:13       A direct person I regard as the real normal man

Speaker 1:          01:00:20       as his tender mother. Nature wished to see him once she graciously brought them into being on the earth. I not such a man til I'm green in the face, he's stupid. I'm not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man should be stupid. How do you know? Perhaps it's very beautiful in fact, and I am the more persuaded of that suspicion if one can call it so by the fact that you take, for instance the antithesis of the normal man that is the man of acute selfconsciousness who has come, of course not out of the lap of nature, but out of a retort. This is also almost mysticism gentlemen, but I suspect this to miss retort made, man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his intense USCIS, the normal man that with all his exaggerated self consciousness, he genuinely thinks himself a mouse and automation at all.

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       It may be an acutely conscious mouse, yet it is a mouse. Well, the other is a man and therefore etc. Etc. And thE worst of it is he himself, his very own self looks on himself as a mouse. No one asks him to do so. And that's an important point. Now, let us look at this mouse in action. Let us suppose for existence, for instance, that it feels insulted and it almost always feels insulted and it wants to revenge itself too. There mAy even be a greater of a cumulation of spike in it than in the man of nature and truth, the base and nasty desire to vent that spite on it's a sale. Assailant rankles, perhaps even more nastily in it than in the man of nature and truth for throw these innate stupidity, the latter. The normal mac looks upon his revenge. Is justice pure and simple? Well in consequences, his acute selfconsciousness the mouse does not believe in any justice at all. To come at last to the deed itself to the very act of revenge apart from one

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       the one fundamental nastiness. The luck was mouse succeeds in creating around it. So many other nastiness is in the form of doubts and questions adds to the one question. So many unsettled questions that there are inevitably works around it, up around it, a sort of fatal brute, a stinking mess made up of it's doubts. Emotions, end of the content spat upon it by the direct men of action who stands solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators laughing at it until they're healthy, sides ache. Of course, the only thing left for is to dismiss all that with a wave of it's paul and with a smile of assumed contempt in which it does not even itself believe and creep ignominiously into its mousehole there and it's nasty. Stinking underground. Home are insulted, crushed and ridiculed. Mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold, malignant and above all everlasting spite for 40 years together, it will remember it's injury down to the smallest most ignominious details, and every time we'll add up itself detail still more in ignominious, spitefully, teasing and turmeric itself with its own imagination. It will be ashamed of it's imaginings, yet it will recall it all. It will go over and over every detail. It will invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things might have happened and will forgive nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:03:49       Maybe it will begin to revenge itself too, but as it were piece meal in trivial ways from behind the stove incognito, without believing either in its own right to vengeance or in the success of its revenge. knowing that from all its efforts at revenge, it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom it revenge itself. While he I dare say, well not even scratch itself on its deathbed, it will recall it all over again. With interest accumulated over all the years now. The idea that nietzsche dostoevsky were developing was that

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       the dawning of consciousness in western society of the mythological substructure of the value system and the impossibility of conceptualizing that or proving the validity of it's structured from scientific means doomed it to do the people who were encapsulated in that system to formal disbelief in it and what they concluded from that was exactly what dos dsd, just stripe, which is that someone with that level of acute consciousness and cultural self knowledge would immediately come become fragmented beyond belief, unable to act, unhappy, resentful and dangerous, and both osteous in nature and in their works and dostoevsky developed this idea most particularly in a novel called the devil's said, that once that you had got to that point, which was inevitable if you were smart enough to take seriously what was going on. It was oNly a tiny step to identification with a murderer city ology. Now, some of the existentialists started to work up what you might regard as a solution to this problem, and I'm going to read character guards

Speaker 2:          01:06:19       solution.

Speaker 1:          01:06:29       It is now cure. ChAracter guard was a danish existential philosopher and he lived earlier the niche and he was, in some sense, you might think about him as the first modern psychologist he was. He was the first person to conceptualize, for example, of the separate entity of anxiety and despair. It is now about four years ago that I got the notion of wanting to try my luck as an author. I remember it quite clearly. That was on a sunday. Yes, that's it. It's sunday afternoon. I was seated as usual out of doors at the cafe in the fredericksburg garden.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       I'd been a student for half a score of years, although never lazy. All my activity nevertheless was like a glittering inactivity. I kind of occupation for which I still have a great partiality and for which I perhaps even have a little genius. I read much spent the remainder of the day idling and thinking our or thinking and idling, but that was all it came to, so I sat there and smoke my cigar until I lapsed into thought among other thoughts. I remember these you are goiNg on. I said to myself to become an old man without being anything and without really undertaking to do anything on the other hand, wherever you look around you in life and in literature, you see the celebrated names and figures, the precious and much heralded men who were coming into prominence and who are much talked about the many benefactors of the age who know how to benefit mankind by making life easier and easier, some by railways, others by omnibuses and steamboats, others by telegraph, others by easily apprehended compendiums, short and recitals of everything worth knowing, and finally the true benefactors of the age who make spiritual existence easier and easier, yet more and more significant, and what are you doing here?

Speaker 1:          01:08:28       My soliloquy, it was interrupted for my cigar with smoked out and a new one had to be lit so I smoked again and then suddenly this thought flashed through my mind. You must do something, but in as much with your Limited capacities, it will be impossible to make anything easier than it has become. You must with the same humanitarian enthusiasm as the others undertake to make something harder. This notion pleased me immensely and at the same time it flattered me to think that I like the rest of them would be loved and esteemed by the whole community,

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       for when all combined in every way to make everything easier, there remains only one possible danger, namely that the eas becomes so great that it becomes altogether too great. Then there is only one want left, though it is not yet felt want, when people will want difficulty out of love for mankind and out of disparate my embarrassing situation, seeing that I had accomplished nothing and was unable to make anything easier than it already was, and moved by a genuine interest in those who make everything easy. I can see that as my task to create difficulties everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       Same idea in different words, a traveler. This is nature and this is part of the development of his answer to the conundrum that he rates a traveler would seen many countries and peoples and several continents was asked what human traits he had found everywhere and he answered. Men are inclined to laziness. Some will feel that he might've said with greater justice, they are all timid. They hide behind customs and opinions at bottom. However, every human being knows very well that he is in this world just once as something unique and no accident, however strange we'll throw together a second time into a unity such a curious and diffuse plurality. He knows it, but he hides it like a bad conscience. Why procurer of his neighbor who insists on convention and veils himself with it, but what is it that compels the individual human being to fear his neighbor and to think and act heard fashion and not to be glad of himself a sense of shame perhaps in a few rare cases in the vast majority, it's the desire for comfort and inertia.

Speaker 1:          01:11:00       In short, that inclination to laziness of which the traveler spoke, he's right. Men are even lazier than they are timorous, and what they fear most is the troubles with which any unconditional honesty and nudity would burden them. Only artists hate this slovenly life in borrowed manners and loosely fitting opinions and unveiled the secret. Everybody's bad conscience. The principle that every human being is a unique wonder. They dared to show us the human being as he is down to the last muscle himself and himself alone. Even more that in this rigorous consistency of his uniqueness, he is beautiful and worth contemplating as novel and as incredible as any work of nature, and by no means dope. When a great thinker despises man, it's their laziness that he despises for it is on account of this, that they have the appearance of factory products and seem indifferent and unworthy of companionship or instruction. The human being who does not wish to belong to the mass materially seats must merely cease being comfortable with himself. Let him follow his conscience, which shouts at him. Be yourself. What you are at present, doing, opining, and desiring. That's not really you.

Speaker 1:          01:12:35       That's nietzsche and dostoevsky and existentialism in. That's the bare beginning of the thing.
