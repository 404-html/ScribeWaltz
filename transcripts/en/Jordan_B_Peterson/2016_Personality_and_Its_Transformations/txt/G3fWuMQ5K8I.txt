Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Okay, so we're going to talk about piaget today and as I believe I mentioned to you before, Psj was perhaps the 20 20th centuries for most developmental psychologist. He didn't regard himself as a psychologist. However, fact, a lot of the people who've been great psychologists have come in from outside the field. It's often engineers, for example, engineers that helped us establish most of our statistics anyways. Piaget, I suppose would have regarded himself more as a biologist be called themselves a genetic epistemologist, and by genetic he didn't mean the genes that organize your cells and spin you up out of nothing. He meant beginnings as in genesis and then an epistemologist with someone who was interested in how structures of knowledge emerge and how they're constituted. So we actually thought of himself as a biological philosopher now know one of the things that's kind of sad about learning about great theories is that you'll hardly ever learned about how peculiar that people who formulate them are.

Speaker 1:          00:01:17       Because generally they're extraordinarily interesting people you know, and that that in some ways that often they get sanitized in some way once they've become respectable. And that's really quite unfortunate. Piaget was really a genius. He was offered a position at a large museum, and I remember, I remember correctly, it was perhaps it wasn't director, but it was the position of approximately that stature. He was offered that when he was 10 years old, he'd written a paper on Mollusk behavior which was published and his parents told the museum people that he, of course they didn't know he was 10, you know, that he probably wasn't up for the job at that time. So, but that gives you some example, some idea about the magnitude of his intellect and Piaget wrote a lot. And you know, usually what you hear about if you study piaget in North America, if you hear about piaget, you hear about his stages of development, sensory motor, etc.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       And uh, that really wasn't what piaget was all that interest to Vietnam. There wAs something about the idea of countable stages that seem to appeal to north american developmental psychologists, but piaget didn't really regard that necessarily as either the central or the most important part of this theoretical edifice. Um, and you know, part of what piaget has been criticized for in recent years is that the stages don't necessarily occur either as he described her in the order that he described, but in some ways he wouldn't have found that particularly distressing because it was more of an attempt to explain how the personality emerged out. Nothing in some ways because in some ways you've kind of emerged out of nothing, you know, and it's not that easy to figure out for piaget in some ways you've sort of booted up. Although he wouldn't haVe used that metaphor obviously having existed in the time before.

Speaker 1:          00:03:12       That was a commonly known phenomena. So he also was concerned abouT high level metaphysical problems. And so one of the things that really motivated piaget was the contradiction between science and religion. That was very painful for him. And one of the things that he had set out to do as a young man was to bridge the gap between science and religion. And in some ways you might think about that in relationship to the sorts of things we talked about last class is that he was attempting to bridge the gap between a description of the world and a prescriptive description of the world, which means what the world is and how the world should be or what the world is and how you should act. and I think that's the most straightforward way of thinking about the division between religion and science because you need to know how to act.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       You can think about it as a division between morality and science or you can think about it as a division between behavioral wisdom and science, which I think is even a better way of thinking about it because it, it takes the specifically religious element out of it. so, but anyways, piaget wanted to devote his life to solving that problem. And I would say that's what he did. He also identified an interesting stage that you also hear very little about, but seems to be to be something worthy of note and also worthy of consideration. He thought that many people in their late adolescence went through a messiaNic stage. And what he meant by that was that when late adolescents or young adults, we're trying to orient themselves in the world, they were trying to figure out how they might plot their pAth forward in life so that they actually made a difference, you know, so they started to become concerned about the state of the world and about their role in determining that state and getting interested in and perhaps involved in large scale political or social movements.

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       And he was the only psychologists that I've ever seen who actually identified that as a stage, but it's switched. We're thinking about, you know, because it certainly is the case that many young people do pass through a stage that's something like that. And, um, it's interesting to speculate on it as a standard part of human development. Now. I think it's probably more characteristic of people with certain personality types. So I suspect if you're more extroverted and you're more open, um, particularly more open, which is the creativity dimension in the big five that you're more likely to be politically and socially, uh, compelled, you know, so we know, for example, that openness is a very good predictor of things like political liberalism and uh, you know, certainly a lot of the millennial movements and that religious movements that you see on campus that have what would arguably be a political base seemed to be associated with high openness.

Speaker 1:          00:06:05       So maybe that stage doesn't occur in everyone's life, but it certainly seems to occur in many people's lives. Okay. So now you might ask yourself, well, what was piaget up to? And while he wanted to figure out a lot of things and he was interested in very, very fundamental issues. So for example, his theories dealt with things like number in space. Product can't see that very well. It doesn't matter. I'll tell you what it says, time and speed, permanent objects. How did, how did a person developed the notion of what constituted a permanent object? How do you know when one thing is the same? When it changes into something different, so for example, if you pour one bit of liquid from one container into another, how do you know that the amount of liquid is the same? Um, how do children develop their ideas of chance and causality? How do they develop their concerns about morality and their moral knowledge? What, what the, what are they doing when they're playing? And I think actually piaget's most fundamental contribution as far as I'm concerned, came in his studies and analysis of play and also to some degree his, his analysis of dreams and he also spent a lot of time giving serious consideration to the role that imitation played in, in the scaffolding of the human personality. And so, um, so some of the, so,

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       uh, piaget believed that, well, I think this is the easiest way to talk about it. Actually will use this diagram here. So I'll shut this light, go off. It took me a long time to construct this diagram. So not because it's all that technically difficult, but it took a while to think it up. So I want to give you a little bit about background to it. So I imagine that

Speaker 1:          00:08:14       one of the things that distinguishes a human being from a computational device say, or at least the standard sort of computational devices that are primary cognitive problem, is how to perceive the world so that we can act in it so that we can get what we need to have or one. Okay, so all three of those things are roughly equivalent importance, right? You have to be able to perceive and you have to be able to act because if you can't act and he can't get what you need and if you can't get what you need, then of course there isn't an you. And so we're trying to always solve those problems simultaneously and we're also trying to do it in a way that's sustainable. Now, what that means in part is that the knowledge structures of human beings are organized or or they are organized along those three dimensions in those three dimensions also constitute the problem space.

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       In some sense, that has to be addressed for a solUtion to be useful. So not only do you have to be able to perceive in some accurate manner, but the accuracy is determined in part on in terms of whether or not the way that you're perceiving helps you pursue something that you want to pursue and then the utility of wanting to pursue something is dependent to some degree on the relationship between the utility of that and the things that you need to continue to survive. Now some psychologists have addressed that by thinking about such things as fundamental drives, you know, and that was mostly a behavioral idea in some ways and the drive might be hunger and, and the idea of a drive would be that hunger is a motivator that helps you put together a strings of motor behaviors that are sort of run out in automatic sequence so that you can, you can get the end that you want and continue one perhaps to fulfill another drive.

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       But the idea of drive is a little bit on the oversimplified side. although it has its place. I think that you can conceptualize the relationship between all of these by thinking in the following manner. So imagine first of all that people are after something, generally speaking. Now, if you look at us, you can kind of tell that were the sorts of creatures that are after things and the way that you can tell that is first of all that we can move and do so frequently, so we're always on a voyage of some sort of a journey of some sort from point one to point to or from point a to point b. I would say as well that that's also the hallmark of a simple story. If you're telling someone a story, generally what you do is you tell them about a time that you were somewhere and then you did some things and you went somewhere else. It's a very, very simple story.

Speaker 1:          00:10:44       Now the advantage of thinking about it as a story is that it helps you understand that the entire cognitive structure can't be reduced to necessarily anything that's, for example, that's drive like you have to think about it as more personality like and so you want something you orient yourself towards. Now, the way you do that, generally speaking, is with your sensory and your conceptual systems, right? So for example, if you want to walk towards the door, then you turn your head and you make yourself a mortal of the door and that model has to be bounded by its relevance to your action so you know the things that are going to be relevant to you about the door, for example, might be whether or not it's tall enough for you to walk through or whether or not the door is open or closed so that you can, as you're walking towards it, you can organize your body so that you can interact with the object as you see fit.

Speaker 1:          00:11:39       Now you pick your goals, know search for all sorts of different reasons and some of those reasons are more fundamental than others. So for example, fundamental by fundamental, I would mean likely what I mean by fundamental, something like evolutionarily ancient, you know, so the, the older, the necessity or the older, the system that's evolved to to allow you to pursue the necessity, the more fundamental it is and there's not. There's ways of identifying what constitutes the fundamental elements of goal seeking behavior, and you can do that in part by comparing yourself to other animals, you know, and so mammals, for example, all seem to jet to experience something that you might regard as anger or at least defensive aggression. They're all hungry, you know, they all have the, the, they all act as if they're, they're, they're, uh, uh, they highly value sexual behavior and so forth.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       And so those, you can't really think of those things as a specifically human. They're a lower level than that now. So at a fundamental level, you have biological systems that are setting forth what might constitute a goal. And you can think about that. You can think that what the system is doing is setting the goal or you can think that the system is driving behavior. But a better way of thinking about it is that the fundamental motivation motivational system sets up a framework that's like a personality that then acts in the world. And so this personality has something in mind that it wants. It has a collection of perceptions that organize itself around that thing that it wants, and then it has a plan or associated motor behaviors that it can lay out in the world that will take it from the point where it is to the point that it wants to be okay now.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       So once you know that, then you can start to think about these plans or these goals or these stories or these frameworks. I think those are all. You can even think about them as games. In some ways. You can think about them at different levels of complexity. Now what piaget was trying to do in part was to describe how a framework of this sort or a sub, a sub element of personality might develop itself and complexity over time. So, so the diagram I have here before he shows these little oval like figures and in the bottom left hand corner there's a box that says what is in the top right hand corner. There's a box that says what should be, and then there's some arrows showing a planned sequence of behavior. And the idea is that you have a sense of where you are and you have a sense of where you're going and that constitutes the framework within which you're looking at the world.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       And then within that framework there's different things that you can do with your body in order to advance from the first point, the second point. Now it's important to understand that this sort of thing is grounded in behavior and not in conception because it helps you also understand the nature of these fundamental elements of personality. The fundamental elements of personality or not descriptions of the world are tools for acting in the world, including the associated behaviors. Now, whether they're behavioral or to some degree depends on their level of abstraction. So, so here's how you. How to think about that. So imagine that you say that someone's a good person and you might say, well that's a description of the and that. And when you think about description, you tend to think about description in the way that you would describe an object in the world, like a scientific description.

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       But when you talk about someone as a good person, you're actually not describing them as an object in the world, wouldn't even describe yourself as an object in the world, that way what you're doing is using a shorthand to represent a higher the hierarchical arrangement of their personality and you can get away with it because when you say good person to someone, they already have an understanding of good person and they know what that hierarchy is and so you don't have to explain the whole thing to them and you can understand each other without even necessarily knowing exactly the details of what you're talking about. But I'm going to tell you now what I think you mean when you say that sort of thing. So imagine that good person is a description at the very, at the top end of a hierarchy. Okay? because good, the good is a very high level philosophical abstraction.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       It's a high level value. Be good. Okay. So what does that mean? If you decompose it? Well, we'll do it in a relatively straightforward manner. One that isn't really. It's more observational than philosophical. So let's say you take, you take someone who's a 40 year old mother for the sake of argument and who will say she also has a job. So if she's a good person and she's a mother, you might think that's one sub element of her personality. If she's a good person is being a good parent. Right? And I think you've put person above parent in the hierarchy because to be a good person you can be a good parent without being a good person, but it's hard to see how you could be a good person without being a good parent. So, and maybe if you're a good person, you're more than a good parent, you know you're probably a good partner and maybe you're good at your job and like there are, there are large domains of activity that you're good at or good in and with some your behavior across that are average year behavior across that or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       Then you ended up reasonably being described as a good person. Maybe you're a good friend as well and so good person has levels of hierarchy underneath it and were. And then each of those things that have levels of hierarchy, each of those entities at the level of hierarchy, right underneath, good person can also be decomposed. So we're going to decompose them and we're gonna see what happens. Because partly what happens is if you decompose them, you get right to the bottom. It's not an infinite decomposition. And so I also think this is one way that you can think about the relationship between the mind and the body because of the relationship between the mind and the body is a very tricky thing because the mind seems to be made of stuff that's other than the body. And I think there's some truth to that partly because we don't really understand consciousness, but there are.

Speaker 1:          00:17:48       But that's a complex problem and I think you can get a fair ways in addressing the mind body problem without having to drag into the problem of consciousness. So okay, so we could say, well good person sub element of that is good parent. Then you might think, well what is it that you need to be doing to be a good parent? And we might say, well, you have to have a good job, maybe that's one up in the hierarchy, but whatever, you have to have a good job because otherwise you can't provide for your children and you have to be able to care for the children. You might say, well, someoNe's good at caring for children and then you might ask them, well, what does it mean to be good at caring for children? And then you have to sort of think of the sub elements that would go into caring for children.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       And so one of them here is you have to know how to cook a meal or complete a meal and then you also have to know how to play with the baby so we could concentrate on playing with the baby. And so what you do when you're playing with a baby, you might play peekaboo. You might tickle the baby and you might clean the baby. Okay? Now you start thinking, well obviously once you're starting to get down to that level of detail. So that's a high resolution model, right? You're, you're starting to move from a low resolution model, good person to a high resolution model, which are what are precisely the multitude of elements that make up being a good person. Well, if you're playing peekaboo with a baby, for example, all of a sudden you're doing something that's not exactly conceptual. Being a good person is conceptual, but playing peekaboo isn't conceptual and the reason it's not conceptual, it's because he actually have to move your hands to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       So if you get to a high enough level of resolution in the description of a personality, what you start describing our patterns of behavior, now they have associated, you know they have an associated motivational framework and a viewpoint that goes along with them so that I would say, well, even while you're playing peekaboo with the baby, that the, the element of you that's playing peekaboo is best described as a subpersonality. It's a playful subpersonality and then it's the subpersonality that specifically knows how and is motivated to play peekaboo. But what it's composed of is no longer as subpersonality it starting to be composed of actual movements. So, and then underneath that, if you go to higher resolution, like, okay, what's the movement composed of? Well obviously you start to have to talk about musculature and then if you go below that, it's molecular movements and so on, but, but once you're down below a voluntary movement, there's really no you there anymore, right?

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       You sort of fade into unconsciousness because you know how to go like this, but you don't exactly know how to move the specific muscles that enable you to go like that. Or even if you do, you don't know how to twitch the muscle fibers or something like that. Right? There's some law. You don't know how to operate the cells. There's some level of resolution underneath voluntary motor control that that basically runs on automatic and to some degree you're capable of like steering it, but you're not really capable of. You're certainly not capable of being conscious of it. So the, the abstract moral conception, which is also a description, good person hits the world at the level of motor output now and a lot like even your sensory movement. A lot of outs, motor outPut, right? Because a lot of what you're doing with your eyes is moving them, so all right, now what does that have to do with piaget?

Speaker 1:          00:21:09       Well, one of the ways of understanding piaget is that he built. He was really interested in understanding how that entire system came to be and his theory is a bottom up theory. He says, okay, yeah, this is this. This is. He hasn't said this, but it's a very useful way of thinking about it because piaget believed that you started with small elements of what he called reflexive behavior and then you learn to chain them together and increasingly complex structures and then you chain those complex structures into more and more complex structures and so on and so forth until you built up the entire hierarchy. But you tended to start from the bottom. So piaget was particularly interested in what the minimum conditions were for something to emerge into the world so that he could build itself out of nothing. And that's really what he was interested in when he was starting to talk about infant development.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       And so piaget's hypothesis with something like this, well kill babies are born very, very immature. You might even say that they're born premature, so I'm a human baby. If you took a mammal, have read about human size and you said, well what's its average gestation period across the animal kingdom? You'd find out that for an animal of our size we should have a gestation period of pregnancy period of two years. So we don't. We hAve a gestation period of nine months. And so you might ask, well why is that? And the answer is complicated. Obviously you've got to hear some of the reasons as far as people can tell 'em we have big heads and they've really been expanding rapidly over particularly over the last 2 million years. But let's say since we split off from chimps, that's about 6 million years. We have very, very large heads and you know, if you look at a baby, a baby's head is pretty damn disproportionately large compared to its body.

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       Like a baby's like a third hat. And so even when the baby's little nine months old, well, nine months after conception and maybe a year and three months before it's supposed to be born, it's head is already extremely big. Now you think, well what's the problem with that? And the problem with that is while the bigger your head is, the harder it is to be born. And you might say, well why haven't the pelvic areas of human beings adjusted females in particular adjusted so that they could handle the birth with a larger head and the answer to that as well, they have to some degree, which is why women have wider hips that men do. But the problem is is evolution is a conservative business and it can only in some sense tinker with what it's already got. And so if you look at the basic bought your basic body plan, your basic body plan in it, most in its most fundamental levels was established some tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:24:07       And then the basic mammalian body plan was established say 60 million years ago. And so if you go, I went to the smithsonian wants and they have a skeleton museum at the smithsonian. It's sort of like a zoo for, for skeletons and it's really interesting place to go because you can see much more help and like mammals are when you see their skeleton. So for example, if you see a bat skeleton, it looks just like a human skeleton, except the fingers are really, really long. But it's the rest of it's like, yeah, that's basically the same skeleton as a human being. IT's just that the pieces have blown up in size or shrunk or, or, or contorted or something like that. But it's exactly the same damn structure. So as, as the brain was growing in the skull was getting larger and women, women's bodies had to adapt to that while there was parameters within which the body had to work.

Speaker 1:          00:24:58       And it turns out that if you make the hips any wider and you make the hole in the middle of the many bigger than the hips start to lose structural integrity. And the other thing that starts to happen is the woman can't run. So there's this weird, you imagine that evolution takes place within this set of constraints and so what's happening is the baby gets born way earlier. The women's hips are wider with the larger pelvic whole but not so wide. They can't run and not so wide. They're not strong and the baby's head is collapsible roughly because the bones aren't completely fused at birth and so generally, especially if it's a larger baby, if it's born, when it, when it emerges just after birth, it's head is quite compressed. Cone Shaped even so. And that's hard on the baby, but it's not nearly as hard on the baby or the mother as not being born at all.

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       So anyways, babies are born pretty premature and you know, that puts a tremendous burden on human parents because of course the child is, I can't even walk for the first year. Whereas you take a deer when a deer is born or an animal like that, you know, it's three minutes later, it's wobbling around on its feet and then it's running away from lions the next morning. It's like, that's, that's not us. You think, why not? It's well were born very premature and very, very vulnerable and you know, it's a major load on the, on the parents. Anyways. One question piaget was interested in is, well, what exactly is a baby born with? And he thought, well, they're born with a couple of things. One is here's three things. In a sense you might think they're born with a couple of reflexes and what you might think of a as a reflex is that it's a built in module of sensory motor capability and maybe it and it, you know, maybe there's a motivational element to it as well.

Speaker 1:          00:26:42       So I would say it's a built in subpersonality and it's a very narrow. Subpersonality has a very narrow cast. And so one thing, one thing babies can do is route. So if you touch them on the site, if they're cheap, then they route. And basically what that means is that they use their mouth and their head to search for something to latch onto with their mouth. And that would generally be a nipple. So they come pre wired to be able to use their mouth and their tongue and certain muscles have their head in order to figure out how to feed and that's actually a very complicated behavior. And so one of the things you see with babies is that their mouth and their tongue is quite wired up already. So if you're looking at a newborn baby, the intelligent part of the baby in some sense like the part that's already there is very much oriented towards health and its tongue.

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       And that's sorta like freud's idea of an oral stage in some sense. Although, you know, you could debate that, but that's partly why freud thought that way. He knew that babies were very mouth oriented. It once they can start using their hands and they can pick up objects. What do they do with objects? I put them in their mouth. Right? Why? Well, because that's what babies do partly, but that's not the only reason. It's like if you look at the. Okay, so back in the fifties, forties, maybe even earlier than that, there is a neurosurgeon named what? Wilder penfield who worked at the montreal neurological institute and he was one of the people who first did, um, surgery for example, for epilepsy. So if you hAve epilepsy, what happens is generally you kind of have a short circuit, there's a malfunctioning set of neurons usually in the hippocampus and they've produced like a positive feedback electrical circuit and it's like a little electrical storm and it'll start in damaged tissue and that's spread across the whole brain.

Speaker 1:          00:28:29       And one of the things the early neurosurgeons were doing was dividing the brain into to stop the hemisphere that had the damage from being able to spread pathological electric electricity across the entire brain. Now when you're doing brain surgery, you don't want to take out anything that isn't absolutely necessary. And so one of the things the brain surgeons do and still do and still do is that they do brain surgery. When you're conscious, which is quite a horrifying thought really, because you know your head is stuck in this little machine that doesn't let it move. and then they're poking around in your brain and you have to tell them what's going on while you're doing it. And if you start being able to respond, then I presume they assume that they've made a mistake and you know, tough luck for you at any ways. Penfield was interested not only in you know, conducting his surgery properly, but also in mapping out the brain to figure out, well, what parts of it could use and you know, do you have to keep and what parts can you maybe get rid of?

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       And part of that was because there was an idea for a long time among neurologists called equal potentiality, which meant that the cortex was an undifferentiated mass of tissue and you can take out parts of it without really much loss of function at all. Which that turned out not to be exactly right. Although it wasn't as stupid as an idea as it might seem, because the cortex is less differentiated than other parts of the brain. But it turns out that if you take out parts of it, like the prefrontal cortex, the damage that it does is not immediately evident. But if you watch the person for any length of time will usually their lives fall apart if their prefrontal cortex is being damaged enough. Anyway. So penfield was trying to figure out what the brain does and so he was using electrodes to touch the surface and what he found, if you imagine that this is the frontal part of your brain here, and it's called that because it's at the front, right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:19       And so there's a back part of it has to do more with sensory processing and then there's a fissure down the middle. And on The front side of the fisher there's an area that's roughly triangle shaped on the back of the fisher, there's another area that's roughly triangle shaped and the front part, if you touch it with a, with an electrode like up the right current, obviously, then people will report feeling something on different parts of their body. And then if you touch the part that's behind the fisher, so roughly about here, so then they'll, they'll be inclined to move or feel the impulse to move. And so what, what then feel did was draw a little map of what parts of the brain were connected to, what sensory sensations in the body and what parts of the brain were contained connected to what motor sensations and he.

Speaker 1:          00:31:08       He built this thing called a homerun keyless. It's a little, it's a little picture and the picture is of this creature that's laid out on the cortex. It's sort of like a dismembered body in some sense, and the size of each part corresponds to the amount of tissue that's devoted to processing that brain or that bodily area. And what you see is very, very interesting because if you look, there's a sensory homonculus. ThAt's how your body looks to your brain from a century perspective. And there's a motor home oculus, which is how your body looks to your brain from the perspective of being able to operate it. What you see for example, is with both the sensory and the motor cortex. The hand is as big as the whole body and the thumb is as big as the rest of the hand. And then the mouth and the tongue are also that big and so is the face.

Speaker 1:          00:31:55       So you've got this little itty bitty body because what are you, what are you going to do with your back? You know, you, you can't pick up anything with your back and you're also not very good. Really your sensory perception on your back is not very high resolution. So if I had one of you stand up and I put three fingers on your back this far apart and I said, how many fingers were there? You wouldn't be able to tell. You'd say one probably, but you can't tell even if you space them out quite a bit if you pushed simultaneously. Whereas on the surface of the hand you can tell immediately because this is a high resolution part of your body. And of course you know you can really move your little tentatively, technically appendages here and they're highly wired up to the brain as well and very, very sensitive.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       But the reason I told you all that, because it's also particularly true with the mouth and the and the lips and the tongue. And then also the entire face, because your face is extraordinarily mobile and you broadcast emotion with that and so it's a, it's a communication device of the highest order and so it has to be really wired up. You have so much neuro control over your face that you can actually teach yourself to fire single neurons in the tissue underneath your eye. So which you certainly not going to be able to do with your back. And then of course, well why would you anyways, so now, so what I tell you that in part so that you get some more understanding of how the child is wired up because that mouth, tongue lip sort of arrangement that, that, that the baby is born with is very, very powerful learning circuit and it's established quite nicely right at birth.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       And so then the baby can start exploring the world using parts of it that are already there. And a big chunk of that is the mouth. So, and you know, you know how this works. Some of you have recently had dental surgery of one form or another, or at least you can remember when you had it. Maybe you had a tooth pulled or a filling or you had racist put in or something. So one of the things you'll notice if you lose a tooth isn't your damn tommy's in there where the tooth was for the next six months. Right? Fiddling around and you can do it consciously, which you will sometimes, but even if you're not attending to it, your tongue will be in there checking out every tiny little crack and crevice in the new area. And what it's doing is updating your map of the map of your body because your mouth wants to know what part of it's you and what part of it isn't.

Speaker 1:          00:34:24       Because first of all, you're not supposed to chew the parts that are you. And second of all, if there's any foreign body in the mouth, obviously you want to get that out of there for endless numbers of reasons so you can detect surface variation with your lips and tongue with tremendous accuracy. And of course, you know there's all sorts of uses that people put that ability to. It's also one of the ways that people a test each other out for sexual compatibility, right? Because that's all mouth and tongue work rough. Not all of it obviously, but at least some reasonable proportion of it. And so that's also a part of exploratory behavior. So you're testing for things like health with, with, with kissing smell. So anyways, it's a major part of you, you know, and not only is it the part that you, that you explore the world with so that you can figure out what to eat and what not to eat, which is a big problem for omnivores, right?

Speaker 1:          00:35:19       Because we can eat damn near anything that's a complex cognitive problem, but you also can use it as a tool for exploring the contours of the world. Now animals really do that with smell, right? Because your typical animal is a smell based creature. Whereas human beings aren't really so much that probably because we became and for a bunch of other reasons, but smell is a tremendously powerful modality and it's pretty much fully there. At birth as well, and you know, mothers report that they can distinguish their baby by smell of virtually, you know, a day or two after they're born and they know what the smell and babies can certainly smell their mothers and their fathers as well. It doesn't take very long at all. So anyways, the baby's got its mouth and so it can start getting somewhere with that. And then it's also got basic reflexes, you know, and now what a baby does in some sense is if it starts developing from the middle and the top downward and outward.

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       So the mouth and the nose are all wired up. I start to get wired up fairly quickly. They're not much to begin with because the baby will move its eyes independently and it's not very good at focusing, although it's focal length is actually, it's natural focal length is pretty much exactly the distance from breast to mothers are, which makes perfect sense, right? Because the baby wants to be able to communicate extraordinarily well to produce a bond with the mother. And that happens most frequently with during breastfeeding, which is also extremely good for the baby because the baby gets touched and babies really, really, really, really need to be touched. If you don't touch them, they die. So even if you feed them, shelter them in all those sorts of things, they have to be touched and it's, it's very good for the baby's development. So anyways, the baby starts out with it's, it's uh, its ability to explore with its mouth and its tongue in its and its ability to smell and that it starts to develop its eyes, but it does that in concert with developing other parts of its body. No one. So the baby, if you put the baby on its stomach, then it starts to exercise its ability to lift up. It's, hey, I didn't. So it kind of gets that going and it starts to learn how to use its arms and its legs. And um, so one thing you can do for a baby

Speaker 1:          00:37:37       for example, to help and get going. So let's say the baby's in its crib, it's laying face upward. Okay? You can give it a mobile. How if you go into a baby store and you look at mobile, what you'll see as maybe the top part is like to coat hangers, right? It's like a cross and then there's things hanging from it and the things will be, I don't know, maybe they're cute. Who knows hello kitty things or some damn thing like that, you know, and they're facing you. Well that's a stupid mobile because you aren't the person who's supposed to be looking at the hello kitty thinks the baby's supposed to be looking at it. So those should be facing down and they never are. They're always facing sideways. So when the baby looks at all it sees is a bunch of horizontal lines. So let's assume that you're reasonably bright and you get one that the baby can see and then maybe it should be black and white or at least really, really bright primary colors because it's easier for baby could detect that black and white.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       It's really good because baby is pretty good at detecting edges and so that thing will move around the baby lay there and watch it, you know? And and babies, they, I think they kind of look like they're stoned on lsd and I actually think that's technically correct because one of the things that hallucinogens do is reduced the inhibiting power of memory on perception. And of course babies have no inhibiting power of memory on perception because they have no memory. So there are pretty much completely overwhelmed by the world all the time. so they laying there watching this mobile and you know, you can shake it and maybe they'll have a little reflex at that or, or you can interact with somebody in the baby will start checking that out and we'll watch it and watch watching to the watch party so that it can get its eyes organized.

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       And it does that in concert to some degree with its motor ability, you know, because you might say, imagine your cross side a little bit like the baby and you're looking at that thing and there's two of them. And you might think, well, how do you know there's not two of them? And the answer to that is what? You have to whack it with your hand as soon as you walk with your hand, you're going to find out if it's one thing or two things. Once you figure out whether that's one arm or two arms, you know, and so the baby is starting to to whack itself against the world and watched the consequences to help it start to build up its ability to interact with the world and its ability to model the world. And so one of the things you watch, for example, if you put a baby in the crib and it's got a mobile there, you want to kind of move to mobile down so that it's close enough so that the baby might be able to bump it because babies, if you, if you don't swaddle them, they lay there and their hands and legs sort of float in space like this.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       And It's because they're not really very well connected to them. And that's why a baby will poke itself and die now. And then with his thumb and it's rather amusing to watch and it kind of bleak manner be. So a baby will lay there and it'll poke itself and will go like that. And what it's just discovered is that there's some relationship between that random movement and that sensation. Okay, now, okay, so let's say it's laying there and it's floating around in space and it's fortunate enough so that it's leg comes into contact with an element of the mobile. Well that will make the mobile do something interesting and novel. And when the bait, when the mobile, that's something interesting and novel that triggers a reflex and the baby and the and the reflex is that the baby will orient towards it and look. And so for piaget that was the circuit.

Speaker 1:          00:41:07       That was the beginning of the baby's ability to sort of start bootstrapping it up in the world. And he thought what you needed was the ability to move a little bit at least. So that'd be the reflex say or even randomness. And then you needed the ability to refine that movement. So you needed to be able to practice it and you need it to be able to improve with practice and you need it to be able to imitate. And warming of the things that piaget thought, which I think is so smart, it's so smart, is that a lot of what babies did was imitate themselves. So for example, maybe they're, they're laying in bed and they're starting to get some sense of the connection between, of how their arms and legs work and so they can maybe make, start to make sort of broad gestures and that's it, but now and then they are lucky in their sort of flinging your arms around them, they hit them all bile and they'd get a little reflex out of that if it's a startle and an indication of interest. And then they'll sit there and practice how to whack that thing with their hand. And so then what. So what they're doing is they kind of accidentally produced a phenomena of interest and they noted the consequence and then what they do is try to reduplicate the phenomena of interest. So basically what they're doing is manifest in different patterns of quasi voluntarily read reflex plaza, involuntary reflex of behavior. And then if that produces something of note, they'll practice imitating it. So when my daughter was about 18 months, maybe not even at all,

Speaker 1:          00:42:47       13, 14 months, maybe old enough to sit up anyways and old enough to start to do some things by herself. We bought her these books. They were disney books, hardcover cardboard books, you know, five pages long or something. Each of the pages was quite thick because it was made out of cardboard and they, four of them would come in a little box which is about four inches high and about an inch and a half wide. And if you really careful you could take out the books and then you can put all of them back in. It wasn't that easy because the first one wasn't too hard, but they got, you know, consistently more difficult as you kept putting each of the men because the parameters of the exercise changed. And she must have spent, I don't know, 150 hours dumping those out, picking them up, putting them in. And you might say, well, what was she doing? And you know, you'd say, well, she was putting books in a box. That's not what she was doing. First of all, they weren't books to her and it wasn't a box because she didn't know what a box was, what she was doing was practicing going like this,

Speaker 1:          00:43:55       you know, and matching the size of something to, uh, to the size of something else and not very complicated and maybe you know,

Speaker 1:          00:44:04       so there is a jar of apple juice. OkaY. So you might say, well pick that up. Okay, well you can pick it up like this. You can pick it up like this, you can pick it up like this, you can pick it up like this. Like there's a lot of things to practice. And each of those movements is a different sensory motor capacity that has an incredibly wide range of potential applications. So a child will sit there and fiddle about their hands in their arms and the rest of their body for untold hours because what they're doing is building up these basic sensory motor systems from the bottom up so that they can, you know, so. So they practice them in one domain where there's some challenge and then they're starting to build new exploratory tools that they can go out and practice on the rest of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:44:51       So you know, once you can grip a, I'd say once you can grip a mobile and you can let go, which is something babies actually have a hard time doing because they have a grip reflex and they're quite strong when they're first born. If you put your fingers in their hands, you can lift them right off the ground, the cling to you. And that's probably old chimpanzee gripping behavior because chimps grabbed to their mothers first and then they're like carried around like that for about three years now. Since you don't have much for. It's kind of useless for the baby, although they're pretty good at getting your hair and your glasses and your nose. And so when you got to get them to let go. So anyways, they'll sit there and practice all these little sub routines. And so you'll see this too. If you have a baby, you got your baby in the highchair, maybe it's nine months old and you're trying to feed the baby, which is often very challenging because babies are very curious and annoying and troublesome and tough and ordinary and exploratory and, and misbehaving and provocative and all those things because they need that to learn about the world.

Speaker 1:          00:45:52       And they'll, they'll do something like maybe they'll eat and they'll drop the spoon and a will go in the floor and they think, oh, gravity, that's interesting. So then you'll give them their, their spoon again, and the first thing they'll do is take their food and finding it on the floor and then they'll do that launch because they're kind of interested in this whole twisting the spoon and having things fall on the floor phenomena. And so it's part of the reason why it's often hard to feed babies is because even if they're hungry, you feed them three things and then they're not starving. And then they're so hyper curious that they're gonna, you know, try to do something else. So, but what they're doing is they're, they're continually utilizing their basic reflexive behavior and building more and more complex structures up on the basis of that and with each time they do that, it opens up a new toolbox for them and they know, expand outward and start to interact with the world. And so that's one way also of understanding where a baby's personality comes from. Ali's is complicated because there are things about babies that are sort of

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       their parameters of personality or somewhat determined at birth. So I'll tell you how I conceptualized this. It's, it's how you might conceptualize the relationship between nature and nurture. I don't know if this is a good metaphor or not. It's not the most elegant metaphor in the world, but it's worked for me. So imagine for example, that a baby at three months of age can be a corn baby or nervous baby. Now that is the case. We know that even right at birth you could kind of figure out whether a baby is a baby or or nervous paypal. that's neuroticism. That's the fundamental dimension of negative emotion. So you might say that one baby's nervous behavior might have this range and another baby's nervous behavior might have this range and another baby's nervous behavior by cab, this range and most of the time it sort of in the middle of that range and now and then it'll manifest behaviors that are associated with what's extreme for it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:02       So even if you have a calm baby, sometimes it'll get upset and even if you have a baby that's always upset, sometimes it will be caught. So then you might ask yourself, well to what degree can you modulate the baby's nervous behavior? So let's say you want to have more calm baby, and so you're going to do some things to make that baby calm. The question is how much transformation can you make? And the answered that to some degree is it depends on how much effort you make. Some changes that are close to the average of the baby's natural curve of responses are fairly easy to make. So you can shift the baby a little bit towards being more calm without too much work. But if you want to shift it more towards being calm, then that's going to take more work and if you're going to shift it more to be calm, that's going to take more work and it's not linear. So what happens is at some point you kind of reach a practIcal limit. You're not going to make your baby more calm than you know. Maybe you could move it one standard deviation or two standard deviations from its natural

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       resting place when it was first, when it first emerged as a creature. But if you're going to move it three to three standard deviations from the fifth percentile to the 95th percentile, you're going to be working out. You're not going to be doing anything else with the baby. So you can start to conceptualize the relationship between nature and nurture as a cost relationship. So for example, iq is quite stable, but you can move iq, but it's really expensive. So there's a practical limit to it. So I think if you take twins that are adopted out at birth in order to get a 15 point difference in iq between the twins, by the time they become adult, one twin has to be at the 95th percentile for wealth in their family and the other twin has to be at the fifth percentile for wealth. So that's a massive difference, right? It's huge. And so it's such a big difference. You're not going to produce that with any degree of ease in the real world. But so environmental transformations of biological parameters, cost, that's a very useful way of thinking about it. So. So anyways, back to the baby.

Speaker 2:          00:50:14       Now

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       the baby is starting to organize itself from the bottom up. And so here's, here's kind of a way to about how that works. Piaget pointed out that this is quite well known in the development literature, that babies that are younger than three don't really play well with others and it's complicated because they can play some things with others. So for example, you can play peekaboo quite well with the nine month old, you know, so there's some sorts of simple games that that babies can play with you pretty much as soon as they get their eyes focused. And one of the funny things about babies when they're very young, even below nine months, is that they already have a sense of humor, which is something I've never been able to figure out. So they can play a little comical games with you as soon as you're smart enough to figure out what the baby's up to roughly speaking as they.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       They appreciate humor absurdly early and it's very difficult to understand why. But anyways, it doesn't matter. The psg eddie and idea was in some sense that what the baby does to begin with his first plays games with itself. So it's exploring, you know, and then it produces some phenomena of interest and then it replicates that until it masters it. And then it just keeps doing that and gets to be more and more and more complex. And then by the time it's about three, it's complex enough so that all of its little microsystems are kind of integrated into one thing, you know, so it's got a set of routines for being hungry. It's got a set of routines for being anxious, it's got a set of routines for being exploratory, it's got a set of routines for seeking attention from its parent and so on. And then it starting to build some overarching unity among all of those micro processes so that it can segue smoothly between them.

Speaker 1:          00:52:13       And you can really see this starting to happen at two because you know, you've heard of the terrible twos and what happens in the terrible two's is that the child is still fairly unintegrated. so they'll go there quite a riot to be around because they're staggeringly emotional. You know, they'll go from Guinea beyond belief to crying outrageously, too. So angry that if you ever saw an adult that angry, you'd immediately run away and call the police. And they can do that like in 15 minuteS. They just cycle through these things very, very rapidly. So and, and weirdly enough adults will notice behaviors or they'll see behaviors in children that would be absolutely outrageous and adults and they don't even really, it doesn't phase them at all. It shows you how well adapted we already children because you know, a child who's having a tantrum, if the child is good at it, you know, they'll fling themselves onto the floor, which you rarely see an adult do.

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       And then the pound and kick and scream, and then if they're really good at it and some of them get really amazingly good at it, they'll hold their breath until they turn blue and pass out. So I try that one night when you're, you know, when you don't have anything to do in your color is off, you know, just see if you can kick and scream on the floor for awhile and then hold your breath until you turn blue and pass out. You can't. And that just shows you how committed to the tantrum a child can be. So it's easy to stop that sort of behavior by the way. So if your child throws a tantrum that said home, just go away and then eventually the child will turn blue and pass out, then they'll come to and there isn't anyone there and that's not really an exciting outcomes.

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       So if you do that two or three times, the child usually figures out that it's really not worth the hassle. If you want him to choke, to continue, wait until they turn blue and pass out and then really freak out. Especially if you could do that randomly a few times, man, you'll get that child just having tantrums, turning blue and passing out pretty much everywhere. So don't, don't do that. That's a bad idea. So all right, now. So the got and idea in some sense is the child builds up these little reflexes and these little, we'll call them subpersonalities because it's a better way of thinking about it and it starts to build them around. Modern psychologists would think more thAt it starts to build them around motIvational systems. Piaget would necessarily say that, but, and then at some point the child starts to enter the social world.

Speaker 1:          00:54:41       Now it's simple in some ways to think of the child before three is not social and then the child after three is social, but it's not really accurate, right? Because if you think about it, the child is being social right from the beginning of its development because first of all it has to figure out, for example, how to feed even if it's not being breastfed. It Has to figure out how to participate in a playful and social manner around feeding and that's particularly the case if the child has to breastfeed because breastfeeding is very complex process. First of all, you have to get the mother to cooperate and you can't fight her, for example, and so there's all sorts of rules about breastfeeding that the baby has to follow and so the babies actually entering into fairly complex social relationships in games right from the beginning, and that's especially true if it also has siblings because if you have a baby and maybe have a two year old, the two year old and the baby are playing right off the bat and they're two year olds are amazingly good at playing with newborns. It's quite staggering to watch them and so if you're thinking about having children, and I also recommend not just having one because one child is way more work than three because you have to amuse one child all the time. Whereas if you have three, you can ignore them completely and they'll just raise each other.

Speaker 1:          00:55:57       It's actually much better for the children, you know, as long as you're there not to make sure that they don't lie to each other on fire and that sort of thing, which is your basically your jaw. So okay. But we'll ask for the time being as if the child isn't social till three because that's simplification, but it's a useful one. So piaget was also extremely interested in how the child became social and I think apart from his ideas about, you know, the, the self generation of the baby from the bottom upwards using its own reflexes and its own capacity to be explored. The other thing that piaget was extraordinarily good at

Speaker 1:          00:56:36       laying out and andy and remarkable at discovering what's the role of games. And so piaget was the first psychologist, I would say, who discovered just how important it is to have kids play. Now, the problem with players that it's fun and so utilitarian people, especially ones that are really conscientious, have this idea that if it's fun, it can't really be good for you. And so because of that, the role of play in children was not and still isn't appreciated in the full dimensions of its importance. So for example, you know, we take the kids that are in grade one there like six, you know, what are we doing for them? We put them in chairs like the ones you're in, you've been in that damn chair for like 16 years, you know, it's like we take those little characters and we put them in chairs and we expect them to sit there and listen to adults for six hours a day while it's, it's so idiotic that it's beyond comprehension. It's no wonder tHe little gliders are hyperactive, you know, that just means they're alive. They shouldn't be taken out into the school yard and supervised well playing until they're completely exhausted. Then they should have a little nap. Then maybe you could teach them something for awhile, but

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       stopping them from playing on an or or not facilitating play among them is absolutely crazy because that's exactly how children come to become social in the world. And the reason for that is that the games children play are analogs of the activities that adults engage in. Well, it's not that hard to figure it out. Figure that out. If you think about it, I mean think about playing monopoly or you're a teenager, you play monopoly. How many people have played monopoly? Great. Everybody's played monopoly. Well, what are you doing? You're, it's like evil capitalist pig gain, right? So, and you know, if you're going to grow up to be an evil capitalist pig, then you can get a good practice, good practice going by playing monopoly and you can, you can become part of the one percent, which is what you have to do to win, right? You need to have all the hotels and so no one else has any hotels and you know, you play that and it's fun. It's fun. So it's an analog of real life now. It's an analog of real life in many ways because most of the things that you do with other people involve adhering to a set of shared rules. And most of the things that you do with other people involve cooperating and competing with them. so if you're playing monopoly, are you cooperating or competing?

Speaker 1:          00:59:19       How many people think competing? Okay. How many people think cooperating? Okay, you're cooperating. Are you playing the same rules? Are you playing by the same rules? Well, yes. Unless you're cheating. If you're cheating, you're not playing monopoly, right? You're cheating. ThAt's a different game. So to play monopoly you have to cooperate because you have to all agree to sit in the same place. You have to agree not to steal the money. You have to agree that the stupid rules which are completely arbitrary, are the ones that are going to govern your life for the next, you know, two hours. You have to agree to try. You have to agree to try to have fun. You have to agree to try to be like a good player, which means you don't get all sniffly and whiny when someone, when you land on someone's boardwalk and they completely bankrupt you, you know, so you're cooperating like mad.

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       And another thing piaget pointed out, which is absolutely lovely, is that you can have a game without cooperation and competition at the same time. So there's no such thing as cooperative games. You have to have for it to be a game, it has to be competition within cooperation or it can be cooperation within competition, within cooperation. You know, these things are very complex and the nasty. So if you're playing hockey, for example, is, is hockey and aggressive game or come or a cooperative game? Well, you have to play by the rules. So both teams agree to that. You're on the ice at the same time. You don't bring a basket basketball, you don't bring a chess game. you're there to play hockey. Are you cooperating or competing with your teammates? Well, both, right? You're cooperating with them because you want everyone to win. Plus, you want everybody to get better at playing across time, but you're competing with them because maybe you can be the star of the game and everybody's happy about that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:08       And then with the other team, well, are you cooperating or competing with them? Well, as long as you're playing by the rules, you're cooperating, but there's obviously an element of competition. Now, almost every human activity has those elements. There's a body of rules underneath it or if they're not rules, they're at least social conventions, right? There are things that people understand are allowed and not allowed, and then there's a competitive and a cooperative element. Alright, so that's what children's start to become particularly exposed to when they're about three. I'll piaget pointed out that there were in some sense two classes of children's games. There was the games that have a really clearly defined aim and that'd be the goal and that'd be like, you know, in the little circles that we were talking about, that's where you're trying to go. Now, the thing about it being a game is that all of you have to be trying to go there at the same time and so what piaget realized was that just as the child is trying to integrate all their little micro games inside them into some sort of unified thing, which would be the child, a stable personality across time and capable of weathering the storms of life.

Speaker 1:          01:02:17       When a group of children get together, they build another one of those routines, but it includes all of them and so the kids might say, well, let's play hide and go seek. That's a good one, and everyone knows the rules to hide and go seek and you can win or lose it heightened, go seek. But what you're trying to do is you have to bring your subpersonalities all the way up to their integrated state underneath a metal structure, but that's organized by the collection of children. So the child would say, well, do you want to play hide and go seek? And you're supposed to say you're either supposed to say yes or perhaps positive another game. You're not supposed to freak out or get angry or say that that's a stupid game or run back to your mom because then you're not going to be very popular and you're not going to get to play, and if you don't get to play well then you're.

Speaker 1:          01:03:04       You're ruined because if you don't learn how to play with others between two and four, you never learn and then you're some poor outcast and maybe you end up in jail or at least you end up like isolated and and awkward and and poorly socially integrated. And that's not good because if you don't get into the kids' games at three, all of them start moving ahead and you don't. And the farther they've moved ahead past you, the less likely it is that they're going to play with you. So one of the things that's really worth thinking about if you're going to have kids is you have a job as a parent and your job as a parent is to make your child socially acceptable, especially to other children by the time they're three. And if you don't do that well, that's not very good. You'll pay for it and so will your child and you know, there's been lots of longterm followup. So on this sort of thing and it seems pretty evident that if the kid isn't socialized by

Speaker 2:          01:04:02       for then good luck.

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       There is no evidence at all from the developmental literature, which is quite a dismal literature that you can fix that. So anyways. All right, so the children don't get together and they say, well here's what we're going to do. And everyone says yes. And so they orient their personalities towards that goal and then they interact in a cooperative and competitive way in pursuing the goal and that's a game and what they're doing is practicing being social human beings and so and they do that with all sorts of different games. and then you might say, well here's something really worth thinking about. What does it mean to be a functional human being? It to me it means to be the sort of human being that can be a good player across multiple games. So you might think, for example, you tell your kid, I'll tell you the story, but hockey game that I saw once hockey parents say 10 percent of them should just be jailed as soon as they enter the arena. So when my kid played,

Speaker 2:          01:05:14       I don't know what you'd call it, a level

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       high level hockey for a while when he was a kid anyways, he was a good, here's a good hockey player, but it was really unbearable. So we didn't do it for very long for a variety of reasons. But anyways, on his way to learning how to play hockey, he was in one of these uh, local leagues. We had an arena just around the corner, fortunately enough and he wasn't the best player on the team. There was a, another kid on the team who was, who is better, I would save. And uh, he uh, he was in a championship game at one point. He hadn't been in very many championship games because there's teams often work very good. But anyways, it was the local championship and we went and watched and it was a really fun game, you know, like it was really close, I think if I think it was three, three till the final 15 or 20 seconds, and then some kid from the other team scored a really good goal, you know, it was, it wasn't one of those things where they accidentally kicked the pocket into the [inaudible] or something.

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       It was a really nice play. And so it was a tight game. The teams were well matched, the local league had made sure like they'd set up teams together and then if one team kept winning to consistently or one losing to consistently being sort of revamp the team so they were roughly equal, which I really liked because, you know, all the kids got a reasonably equal shot at it and everybody got to develop. so anyways, we were watching that. It was pretty fun. And uh, they, the star kid, he was skating around out there and the game ended and he went off the ice and he smashed his hockey stick onto the cement because he was all irritated and you know, which was pretty pathetic. And then his father came running up to him and said, oh, you got robbed. It was really terrible, you know, the rafting was bad and you play it very well and you should have won the game. And he didn't say, you know, stop being a little rat and smashing your hockey, stick onto the cement like your three, which is what he should have said.

Speaker 2:          01:07:06       He, he

Speaker 1:          01:07:09       basically rewarded his child for narcissistic,

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       a immature misbehavior. So it was pretty pathetic. Was child abuse as far as I'm concerned, sort of up the second, man. That's stupid. What are you going to do? You're going to train your child to be a narcissist. That course, that's child abuse. It's moronic. Of course it was due to his own foolishness, but I don't know if that's criminal, right? But it was really pathetic. So, but no, but think about this now for a minute. So you might think, well what did that kid do wrong? It's like, well, he wanted to win, so that's okay. You should want to win. If you're playing a game. I mean you're not any fun if you're playing a game and you're not trying to win and there's nothing more miserable than playing a game with someone. At the end of they say, well you won because I wasn't really trying. It's like, no, you're not going to play with them again if they do that. And that's kind of interesting because it means they've done something wrong. No, when even a kid can figure that out. And so you might tell your kid, be a good sport and it doesn't matter whether you win or not. It matters how you play the game. Now what the hell kid doesn't know how to what to make of that and you hardly believe it. You think, yeah, it doesn't matter if you win. So I don't know what this means, but you'll tell the child that and so then you might think, well, what does it mean to be a good sport? And and that and that. How you played the game is more important than whether you win or lose. Okay, so think about it this way.

Speaker 1:          01:08:37       What's your goal? Well, you might say to win the hockey game, but that implies you're only going to play one hockey game, but it's going to play 100 hockey games and then forget about that. What if you're going to play 100 hockey games and 200 basketball games and 50 chess games and you're going to have a bunch of jobs and you're going to have a bunch of friends and you can have a bunch of relationships and all of those have a game like structure and let's say that you're a real son of a bitch when you play hockey and so no one ever invites you to do any of those other things. It's like, well, you win the game, but you lose the metagame. The metagame is the game that's made up of all the games you're ever going to play and what a parent means when they say it doesn't matter whether you win or lose, it matters how you play the game is that the metagame is more important than the game and you should learn how to play games so that whether or not you win or lose, people really want to play with you because if they want to play with you, man, you're set.

Speaker 1:          01:09:32       Right? So here's, here's a cool game. So, okay, you two are going to play this game. Are you ready? Okay. So here's the deal. I'm going to give you $20. You have to give some of that to him. You want to get to offer once. If he rejects it, neither of you get anything. Okay? How much are you going to give him? 10. Would you take that? Okay? Okay. What? Why? I mean like these better than not second, clara maass, right? Yeah. Yeah. So here's. This experiment is being done all over the world. And so basically what they find is that people pretty much offer 50 slash 50. Now here's something cool. Let's say you go play this game and use 20 bucks in your planet with really poor people. And so you, you set the game up. So you say, look, offer him two bucks, he's poor, he'll take it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       So you offered to box, what does he do? He tells you to screw off, right? And he's more likely to do that if he's poor. So that's pretty interesting. [inaudible], like a classical economists would say, look, what you should've done was offered them a dollar. It's like you get 19, you get 19, he gets a dollar, he's going to take the damn dollar because it's better than nothing. But thAt is more people are like, it's like you give them a dollar and you get 19, they want to punch you, right? They're not going to take that. And that's because they don't want to play the game that way.

Speaker 1:          01:11:02       They want to play the game so that it's fair across multiple games. Now you might say, let's say you're playing out in front of a whole bunch of people like we were now and let's say a whole, all these people are going to be able to invite you to play the same game and so maybe you're going to be able to make $400 in the next hour or so. Then you might say, well, what should I do if I wanted everybody to invite me to play this game as much as possible, then how much would you offer? Fifteen. 15. Exactly. That's cool. So that means actually you lost the gate, the one game, right? Because you only get 15, five and he gets 15, but like everyone's thinking, hey, I'm going to play it escape with her. Well that's, that's what it means when you tell someone to play the game properly. You say, act as if while you're playing a specific game that there's a higher order moral principle that has to do with the total number of games that you're going to play across your entire life and play that game properly. Yeah, well that's the evolution of higher moral thinking in part from a piagetian perspective. It's bloody brilliant. So right. We'll see you tuesday.
