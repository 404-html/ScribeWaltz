1
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I talked a little bit last time about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we were going to cover,</v>

2
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't get quite through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to finish that.</v>

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who weren't here last </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you can watch the lecture because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

5
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stopped at the depth psychologist.</v>

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Really those are the psychoanalysts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychoanalysts are people who are </v>

8
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>concerned with,</v>

9
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a psychoanalyst,</v>

10
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a collection of loosely </v>

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.291
<v Speaker 1>integrated spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it or </v>

12
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.471
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities you're not a unity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>no subpersonalities have their basis in </v>

13
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>while and all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have their basis in past,</v>

14
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>especially traumatic experience or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns of socialization that </v>

15
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>characterized your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they might also have their basis in </v>

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>fundamental biological motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

17
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a psychoanalyst would conceptualize it,</v>

18
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>anger or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps sexual attraction as a </v>

19
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that,</v>

20
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like when you get </v>

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get angry at someone you love.</v>

22
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.700
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

23
00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you know at some level you're wishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>harm.</v>

24
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Now that might only be that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>win the argument and you want them to be</v>

25
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:18.340
<v Speaker 1>nicely crushed while you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so,</v>

26
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 1>so there's a desire that comes along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the anger,</v>

27
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:25.921
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of other things that </v>

28
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:25.921
<v Speaker 1>happened to.</v>

29
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:25.921
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone's annoying you,</v>

30
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:30.571
<v Speaker 1>even if you love them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that at that moment </v>

31
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:33.631
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be able to easily access</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the memories you have about how </v>

32
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:37.681
<v Speaker 1>annoying they are and have difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>time accessing the memories about how </v>

33
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>wonderful they mean to you is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

34
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know that because sometimes you </v>

35
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.051
<v Speaker 1>get angry with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an argument with them and you </v>

36
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>sort of clue in later you snap out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more or less possessed state and </v>

37
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

38
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I really wasn't taking the context into </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and I was kind of harsh.</v>

40
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.340
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:55.780
<v Speaker 1>so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>

42
00:01:55.781 --> 00:02:00.781
<v Speaker 1>well who's in control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the question the </v>

43
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.871
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts are really interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their answer is it's not generally </v>

44
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:08.041
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very terrifying reading in </v>

45
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.101
<v Speaker 1>some sense because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like to think of themselves as </v>

46
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:12.010
<v Speaker 1>masters of their own house so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just,</v>

47
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 1>it's only vaguely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

48
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:18.460
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that too because you make</v>

49
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe New Year's Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call those resolutions,</v>

50
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:29.011
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to be a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the most common ones is </v>

51
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:29.011
<v Speaker 1>mad and you're going to hit the gym </v>
<v Speaker 1>three times a week.</v>

52
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

53
00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so very few people do.</v>

54
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:37.651
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's hard and so you don't want to </v>

55
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:40.711
<v Speaker 1>do hard things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because </v>

56
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:40.711
<v Speaker 1>they're hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't take much explanation,</v>

57
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's also because you can't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell yourself what to do.</v>

58
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's annoying too because life </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a lot easier if you could just </v>

59
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

60
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 1>well you don't sit down study for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

61
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:53.800
<v Speaker 1>don't watch cats on youtube or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that you're watching.</v>

62
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.730
<v Speaker 1>And No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

63
00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what happens.</v>

64
00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:57.790
<v Speaker 1>You sit there and you study for a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

65
00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:02.791
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about cats and next </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you know you're watching haunted </v>

66
00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:03.990
<v Speaker 1>mansions in London or some damn thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

68
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's a scary idea in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you think,</v>

69
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not reading master of your own</v>

70
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:17.821
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have yourself under full </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary control and you certainly </v>

72
00:03:17.821 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what does.</v>

73
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.640
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud is interesting in that regard </v>

74
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>because he really talked about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motive power of fundamental motivational</v>

75
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:30.931
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly for Freud it was aggression in </v>

76
00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:30.931
<v Speaker 1>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:30.931
<v Speaker 1>and those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are big motivators.</v>

78
00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Let's make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he thought of you as,</v>

79
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>as the conscious part of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality may be as the.</v>

80
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like the captain of a ship with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very unruly crew.</v>

81
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice metaphor because of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ships on the ocean and the ocean can</v>

82
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:51.451
<v Speaker 1>be very stormy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can only sort of plot your </v>

83
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>course and you have to work with what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown at you.</v>

84
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>And then the unruly crew is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

85
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:59.851
<v Speaker 1>it's all your drives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That drives is a wrong way of thinking </v>

86
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:03.061
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I liked the psychoanalytic notion </v>

87
00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 1>of subpersonality because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality has a viewpoint.</v>

88
00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>There's things it wants and it plants.</v>

89
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

90
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:08.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

91
00:04:08.871 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a living entity.</v>

92
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not some dead cognitive system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

93
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>So Freud was interested in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about,</v>

94
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biological underpinnings of the </v>

95
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.480
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.480
<v Speaker 1>because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

97
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.430
<v Speaker 1>he was quite biologically oriented in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he realized that sexuality and </v>

98
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very fundamental subpersonalities.</v>

99
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>And then there's young and young is much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more terrifying than Freud,</v>

100
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>which is really saying a lot because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's quite terrifying,</v>

101
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

102
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.700
<v Speaker 1>he's just terrifying the unbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

103
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.980
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sub personalities that make you up </v>

104
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>are thousands and thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

105
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>They're cultural constructions that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years old and</v>

106
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>they have you in their grip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for union,</v>

107
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.500
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he said,</v>

108
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>and I don't remember where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this phrase,</v>

109
00:04:56.051 --> 00:05:01.051
<v Speaker 1>it's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about this for like </v>

110
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:03.870
<v Speaker 1>five years and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can still think about it after </v>

111
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.870
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

112
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you said was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't have ideas,</v>

113
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.740
<v Speaker 1>ideas have people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something to think </v>

114
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>about because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think about your own situation,</v>

115
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:16.720
<v Speaker 1>so no doubt you have political views and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think I have political views.</v>

116
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no you don't because you share them</v>

117
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're certainly not yours.</v>

118
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.200
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had a very lengthy historical </v>

119
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>development far before you ever showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

120
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're rooted rooted,</v>

121
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.980
<v Speaker 1>right at the depths of your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then of course they've been </v>

122
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.041
<v Speaker 1>elaborated by one philosopher or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>extensively over the last two or 300 </v>

123
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's this whole system of thought</v>

124
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:48.181
<v Speaker 1>and Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it inhabits your brain and then you </v>

125
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:48.181
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

126
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:48.181
<v Speaker 1>I've got political views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

127
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the political views have you.</v>

128
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very salutary thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's one of the ways to stop </v>

129
00:05:58.071 --> 00:06:03.071
<v Speaker 1>yourself from being possessed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people get possessed all the time by </v>

130
00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:03.071
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

131
00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened in Nazi Germany.</v>

132
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

133
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>It happens everywhere all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

134
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>well possessed is a little strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

135
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not actually.</v>

136
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a metaphor obviously,</v>

137
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's the right kind of metaphor </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a body of ideas like political </v>

138
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are living thing,</v>

139
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.660
<v Speaker 1>you know they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not some dead dusty words on a </v>

140
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.531
<v Speaker 1>bookshelf somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're an integral part of a dynamic </v>

141
00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 1>society and and the motive force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas have motivates you.</v>

142
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:40.271
<v Speaker 1>You're in their grip and so you can tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking to someone who's </v>

143
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:44.860
<v Speaker 1>completely possessed by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by an idea system or in India logical </v>

144
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.101
<v Speaker 1>system because they'll just bore you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death unless you happen to believe </v>

145
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:51.971
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll spout out a few of their </v>

146
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:54.701
<v Speaker 1>fundamental belief axioms and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can identify which system they're part </v>

147
00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:59.141
<v Speaker 1>of and then they just speak in cliches </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that point onward and you can </v>

148
00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>predict everything you're going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know the axioms of the system.</v>

149
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very non authentic speech and that </v>

150
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:11.110
<v Speaker 1>would be a way that say someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers or or,</v>

151
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.120
<v Speaker 1>or Abraham maslow who were humanists of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties might talk about it </v>

152
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.931
<v Speaker 1>because the person isn't speaking from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the depths of their own experience or </v>

153
00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:20.980
<v Speaker 1>from even their embodied knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.990
<v Speaker 1>they're just mouthpieces for abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and so it's very frightening to </v>

155
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 1>realize the extent to which you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mouthpiece for abstract ideas,</v>

156
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually one of the dangers of </v>

157
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.141
<v Speaker 1>becoming educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the mass system like the </v>

158
00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:40.601
<v Speaker 1>university system because a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to you when you come to </v>

159
00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:43.541
<v Speaker 1>university is that you're fed a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pre digested ideas.</v>

160
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's one way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

161
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very easy for you to think,</v>

162
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>well that those are now your ideas.</v>

163
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.260
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are not lots of ideas you have to </v>

164
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 1>earn and if it's a great idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you really have to earn it.</v>

165
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Because why should you be able to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>along and like pluck up a great idea.</v>

166
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:09.190
<v Speaker 1>That's not how things work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to earn things that are </v>

167
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:09.190
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

168
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>the depth psychologist man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so good at that.</v>

169
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>It's lovely to read them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem too is with a lot of the</v>

170
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:18.971
<v Speaker 1>people we're going to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to summarize their </v>

171
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:18.971
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>because often the devil's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>details.</v>

173
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might look at someone like piaget is</v>

174
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:28.091
<v Speaker 1>a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constructivist that we talked about </v>

175
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:28.091
<v Speaker 1>briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

176
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.510
<v Speaker 1>the guy wrote dozens of books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just summarize those suckers.</v>

177
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:34.511
<v Speaker 1>It's not one coherent theory that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can boil down to 10 axioms and then you </v>

178
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 1>can read it while you're flying from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto to Montreal and Poof,</v>

179
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:38.940
<v Speaker 1>Europe yet.</v>

180
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>And psychologists like it doesn't work </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

181
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 1>The people who make who formulated these</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories were extremely intelligent and,</v>

182
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're often great writers and so a</v>

183
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:54.581
<v Speaker 1>lot of the knowledge is actually in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing itself and nodding what you can </v>

184
00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>extract out from the just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>and most of the theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud Young,</v>

186
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>it's harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but freud,</v>

187
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 1>rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that.</v>

188
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 1>You can extract out the gist of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories and then you can,</v>

189
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

190
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.420
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can stereotype it or you can correct</v>

191
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:15.430
<v Speaker 1>your it and then you can point out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>your caricatures observed and then you </v>

192
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>can feel like you're even smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>

193
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

194
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these people should also be </v>

195
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 1>approached with respect because man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have so much to tell you.</v>

196
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:26.520
<v Speaker 1>It's so useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

197
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:29.060
<v Speaker 1>So we talked about the depth </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>

198
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>We talked about the constructivists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't talk about the humanists,</v>

199
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists or phenomenologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mouthful of words,</v>

200
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:41.631
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's put a little bit of foundation </v>

201
00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Speaker 1>under those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a humanist,</v>

202
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>to be a humanist means really to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature of the enlightenment.</v>

203
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.670
<v Speaker 1>And a human is thought in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least this is what the humanists </v>

204
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think of it as post religious,</v>

205
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

206
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.920
<v Speaker 1>they think of a humanistic thought as </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting the value of the human being at </v>

207
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:05.250
<v Speaker 1>the center of the cosmos in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuing the person as they are.</v>

208
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 1>And then also valuing the person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could be and,</v>

209
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.840
<v Speaker 1>and promoting the pathways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development that would allow people to </v>

210
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>become what they could be as creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are valuable in their own right.</v>

211
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 1>So a humanist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

212
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 1>would be very skeptical of claims.</v>

213
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.200
<v Speaker 1>So let's say standard Christian claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I use that example because the realm</v>

214
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 1>of ideas that these thinkers emerged out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of was almost always Judeo Christian and</v>

215
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

216
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 1>the roots of their thinking are in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and you can't understand their </v>

217
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.491
<v Speaker 1>thinking without understanding that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of humanism was a rebellion </v>

218
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 1>against the idea that life on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

219
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:51.870
<v Speaker 1>was of limited value because everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>of any importance was going to happen in</v>

220
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:55.350
<v Speaker 1>the afterlife after you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

221
00:10:55.351 --> 00:11:00.351
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's here and now it's right now that </v>

222
00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:00.351
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

223
00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:03.621
<v Speaker 1>life in the present is what's important </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't need some kind of </v>

224
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:07.041
<v Speaker 1>afterlife or some kind of belief in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent reality in order to find </v>

225
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.250
<v Speaker 1>value right here and now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

226
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:09.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

227
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of good things about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

228
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:17.070
<v Speaker 1>And the whole idea that you can improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in some sense is a humanistic </v>

229
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.011
<v Speaker 1>idea and most of you have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you believe that you can </v>

230
00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:22.011
<v Speaker 1>improve yourself?</v>

231
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.510
<v Speaker 1>So is there anybody who doesn't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

232
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:30.710
<v Speaker 1>that's willing to admit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So usually people only don't believe </v>

233
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>that if they're very depressed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopeless,</v>

234
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:33.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's not self evident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>

236
00:11:34.641 --> 00:11:37.230
<v Speaker 1>in many cultures you could think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>medieval culture,</v>

237
00:11:37.231 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe where you know,</v>

238
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:43.701
<v Speaker 1>you were sort of stuck in your position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no real idea of self </v>

239
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could try not to sin,</v>

240
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 1>but you aren't going to get like </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically better in some way.</v>

241
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>You are just who you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was that.</v>

242
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 1>But not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case for the,</v>

243
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists were kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kettle of fish.</v>

244
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.840
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Freud talks about psychopathology,</v>

245
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:04.510
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of personality is about </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology,</v>

246
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:06.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How personal this can go wrong.</v>

247
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Freud kind of thinks of the normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>person roughly speaking as healthy in </v>

248
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:16.171
<v Speaker 1>their normality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps transformed into a </v>

249
00:12:16.171 --> 00:12:19.561
<v Speaker 1>pathological version of themselves by </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of past trauma and that might </v>

250
00:12:19.561 --> 00:12:20.870
<v Speaker 1>often be an abusive childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.890
<v Speaker 1>or or maybe a sexually abusive childhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know Freud talked a lot </v>

252
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:25.890
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

253
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.930
<v Speaker 1>It happens fairly frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for Freud,</v>

254
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.740
<v Speaker 1>all things considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you weren't healthy,</v>

255
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.610
<v Speaker 1>there was a reason for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

256
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.630
<v Speaker 1>something terrible that happened to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you needed to come to terms with </v>

257
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.721
<v Speaker 1>that terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However you might do that and put </v>

258
00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:42.970
<v Speaker 1>yourself back together and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could wander along.</v>

259
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Being a healthy person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the existentialists,</v>

260
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:50.461
<v Speaker 1>that's not how they think at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think the standard human being is </v>

261
00:12:50.461 --> 00:12:54.631
<v Speaker 1>pathological and the reason they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is because they think that self </v>

262
00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 1>conscious existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so life,</v>

263
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 1>the life of a creature that knows it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounded in time and space,</v>

264
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:06.031
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knows it's vulnerable to disease and </v>

265
00:13:06.031 --> 00:13:10.081
<v Speaker 1>illness and death and the loss of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they love and the disintegration of</v>

266
00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:15.361
<v Speaker 1>all things in some sense is that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of a problem to give you </v>

267
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:19.590
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without having to have been abused by </v>

268
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.471
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the existentialists view life </v>

269
00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:25.621
<v Speaker 1>itself as a problem of sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude that it can destabilize you </v>

270
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.330
<v Speaker 1>mentally merely by being aware of it.</v>

271
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.140
<v Speaker 1>And so they also believe that often what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do as a consequence of that is </v>

272
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.290
<v Speaker 1>flee from their own awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:40.291
<v Speaker 1>so how do you deal with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is suffering but you don't think </v>

274
00:13:40.291 --> 00:13:40.291
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

275
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>for an existentialist that's not a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good answer.</v>

276
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:46.240
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for clinical psychologists,</v>

277
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:51.241
<v Speaker 1>that's also not a very good answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the literature suggests pretty </v>

278
00:13:51.241 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 1>damn strongly that the harder you run </v>
<v Speaker 1>from something you're afraid of,</v>

279
00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:58.090
<v Speaker 1>the larger it becomes and the faster it </v>
<v Speaker 1>chases you.</v>

280
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So avoidance of avoidance is generally a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad strategy.</v>

281
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not always the case because </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if you can't do anything about</v>

282
00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:13.261
<v Speaker 1>something really you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's not a lot of sense spending</v>

283
00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>a lot of time planning and struggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>against it.</v>

284
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:20.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people are in generally </v>

285
00:14:20.731 --> 00:14:20.731
<v Speaker 1>genuinely hopeless situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

286
00:14:20.731 --> 00:14:20.731
<v Speaker 1>but often did not.</v>

287
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.110
<v Speaker 1>So I really liked the existentialist </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

288
00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I think they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

289
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:26.020
<v Speaker 1>I have all the people that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about,</v>

290
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.400
<v Speaker 1>their thinking is extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable.</v>

291
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.240
<v Speaker 1>It helps situate you in your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps clarify the nature of your </v>

292
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 1>relationship to other people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

293
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:41.881
<v Speaker 1>It helps you lay out what your future </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be if you were the creatures that </v>

294
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you could be really wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists.</v>

295
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.650
<v Speaker 1>They're tricky bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the fundamental phenomenologists was</v>

296
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Martin Heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was also somewhat also somewhat </v>

297
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.340
<v Speaker 1>tangled up with the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

298
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was clearly not a good thing.</v>

299
00:15:01.231 --> 00:15:06.231
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people debate about whether or not you </v>

300
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:08.591
<v Speaker 1>can separate out his philosophy from </v>
<v Speaker 1>what tangled them up with the Nazis and </v>

301
00:15:08.591 --> 00:15:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

302
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger,</v>

303
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.300
<v Speaker 1>heidegger learned to take a fresh look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the nature of reality.</v>

304
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:22.130
<v Speaker 1>And so heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his idea was that we,</v>

305
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.580
<v Speaker 1>we made a fundamental philosophical era </v>
<v Speaker 1>way back when,</v>

306
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 1>when we were Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greek,</v>

307
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.010
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we started concentrating on the</v>

308
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:31.940
<v Speaker 1>wrong elements of.</v>

309
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.090
<v Speaker 1>He didn't read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really call it reality being.</v>

310
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.550
<v Speaker 1>So a phenomenologist as someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with being and you,</v>

311
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

312
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:42.470
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality?</v>

313
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:47.471
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you define being and </v>

314
00:15:47.471 --> 00:15:51.371
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how you define reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So heidegger's observation was that for,</v>

315
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.980
<v Speaker 1>for for modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

316
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.060
<v Speaker 1>reality is sort of a d animated </v>
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>

317
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.410
<v Speaker 1>objective substrata.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

318
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.280
<v Speaker 1>it's dead in its essence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

319
00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:09.281
<v Speaker 1>and the things that are most real are </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely those things you can think </v>

320
00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:10.640
<v Speaker 1>about that it's all objective reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>

321
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.940
<v Speaker 1>but when what heidegger tried to point </v>
<v Speaker 1>out is there's a choice in some sense </v>

322
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:22.030
<v Speaker 1>because of your knowledge is finite </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're fundamentally ignorant </v>

323
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:26.051
<v Speaker 1>about all things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide that certain things </v>

324
00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:26.960
<v Speaker 1>are true and then act from that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

325
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:31.961
<v Speaker 1>heidegger's point was there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you can decide about at the </v>

326
00:16:31.961 --> 00:16:35.621
<v Speaker 1>very fundamental level of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of axiom and so one of the things you </v>

327
00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:38.690
<v Speaker 1>can decide for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is whether or not the objective world is</v>

328
00:16:38.691 --> 00:16:43.691
<v Speaker 1>what's more real or whether or not your </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived experience is what's more real now</v>

329
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:46.760
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the distinction there?</v>

330
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.760
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the distinction is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably something like watching someone</v>

331
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:55.400
<v Speaker 1>in pain on a video and being in pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

332
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so pain is a good example of,</v>

333
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.400
<v Speaker 1>of an element of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's obviously it's obviously </v>

334
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.810
<v Speaker 1>you experience it within your own.</v>

335
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.870
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to talk about this because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses different terminology.</v>

336
00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Pain is an element of your being and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

337
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the pain itself is not something </v>

338
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:22.430
<v Speaker 1>that you can even conceptualize in </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective terms.</v>

339
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you can measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:26.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe your heart rate goes up when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in pain or something like that or</v>

341
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 1>your facial expressions change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

342
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:33.851
<v Speaker 1>so you can index it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the indexes are not the phenomena </v>

343
00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 1>that's hence phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

344
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:39.680
<v Speaker 1>And so the phenomenologists have built </v>
<v Speaker 1>up an entire system of thinking,</v>

345
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.160
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the initial axiom that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best way to approach life is to assume </v>

346
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.740
<v Speaker 1>that being is the fundamental reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than the objective as the </v>

347
00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 1>fundamental level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>

348
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:54.150
<v Speaker 1>well why do people are with that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

349
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 1>And part of it is one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an existentialist plate.</v>

350
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:03.050
<v Speaker 1>One of the consequences of developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the objective theory of existence was </v>

351
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:06.410
<v Speaker 1>obviously all of the amazing technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have around us and you know,</v>

352
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.450
<v Speaker 1>great thank going for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise we'd be sitting outside </v>

353
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.301
<v Speaker 1>freezing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the consequences of that is </v>

354
00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:17.631
<v Speaker 1>once people established objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and then defined it as </v>

355
00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:20.930
<v Speaker 1>ultimately real terrible questions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning of life or ropes,</v>

356
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if the world,</v>

357
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:24.540
<v Speaker 1>the universe is made out of nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead matter,</v>

358
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:29.541
<v Speaker 1>it's eternally existing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're nothing but a candle flashing the </v>

359
00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:33.591
<v Speaker 1>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea creeps into your mind that </v>

360
00:18:33.591 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 1>perhaps all of the damn suffering isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth it or,</v>

361
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.730
<v Speaker 1>or could put it another way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

362
00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:40.731
<v Speaker 1>does your life really have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any real meaning or is that just an </v>

363
00:18:40.731 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 1>illusion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

364
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.580
<v Speaker 1>heidegger would say the reason that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that problem is because you're </v>

365
00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 1>approaching the entire problem wrong.</v>

366
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Clearly things have meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't.</v>

367
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:55.101
<v Speaker 1>If you make the hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's our objective is </v>

368
00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:58.500
<v Speaker 1>ultimately real and everything else is </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely a secondary consequence of that.</v>

369
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>

370
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 1>It takes a while to get your head around</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

371
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm the humanists and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialists and to some degree the </v>

372
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.810
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all came out of,</v>

373
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.170
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a variety of sources for their</v>

374
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:18.171
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and I would say one of them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the clash between religion and science </v>

375
00:19:18.171 --> 00:19:19.650
<v Speaker 1>or between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between value and objective truth.</v>

376
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.650
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rectify the division.</v>

377
00:19:22.651 --> 00:19:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And Piaget himself was trying to do some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that as well.</v>

378
00:19:25.111 --> 00:19:27.100
<v Speaker 1>So it was young I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

379
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:32.420
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing is a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialist and humanist work was </v>

380
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.030
<v Speaker 1>post World War Two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

381
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after World War Two happened with its </v>

382
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.120
<v Speaker 1>immense catastrophes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course people who were thinking about</v>

383
00:19:39.121 --> 00:19:44.121
<v Speaker 1>human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very interested in why such a </v>

384
00:19:44.121 --> 00:19:46.281
<v Speaker 1>thing could happen and existentialism at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least as a psychological school arose in</v>

385
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:48.780
<v Speaker 1>part as a reaction to the horrors of </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War Two.</v>

386
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a very serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very serious branch of psychology </v>

387
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.830
<v Speaker 1>and it was mostly characterized thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 fifties before the hippies </v>

388
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.460
<v Speaker 1>came along and made everything sweetness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and light.</v>

389
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.640
<v Speaker 1>So which is more where Roger's and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>maslow fit.</v>

390
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.070
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to talk about them a fair</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit that the three different categories.</v>

391
00:20:08.071 --> 00:20:12.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of a strange approach in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense that this class takes.</v>

392
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Because I talked to you about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists in that in that period,</v>

393
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:19.110
<v Speaker 1>but the other people I talked to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly about aren't set.</v>

394
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:24.240
<v Speaker 1>They're not technically psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on what you mean by </v>

395
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:24.660
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

396
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.410
<v Speaker 1>I talk a lot about Nietzsche and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky and then also a lot about our</v>

397
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Russian literary figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who wrote a book </v>

398
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.310
<v Speaker 1>called the Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was one of the.</v>

399
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
<v Speaker 1>There was a few cataclysmic events that </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought the totalitarian system of the </v>

400
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union to a halt and you can argue</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what they were,</v>

401
00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:51.561
<v Speaker 1>but one of them for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what social needs and published </v>

402
00:20:51.561 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 1>publication of the Gulag Archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a 2,700</v>

403
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 1>word book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2,700</v>

404
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 1>page book.</v>

405
00:20:55.870 --> 00:21:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Can I get that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That describes what it was like to be </v>

406
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:04.540
<v Speaker 1>there and how many people died and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

407
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a searing book you want to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about prize and he deserved it.</v>

408
00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn,</v>

409
00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 1>a remarkable person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like the Dostoevsky of the 20th </v>

410
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.261
<v Speaker 1>century and that's really saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and Dostoevsky is another </v>

411
00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:23.040
<v Speaker 1>person I use a lot in that section and </v>
<v Speaker 1>both Dostoevsky and niche and regard </v>

412
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.490
<v Speaker 1>themselves as psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

413
00:21:25.491 --> 00:21:30.491
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because when you think about </v>

414
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:30.491
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

415
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 1>usually think about people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducting experiments,</v>

416
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:33.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then one of the things,</v>

417
00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:35.260
<v Speaker 1>and you'll notice this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>

418
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.800
<v Speaker 1>a lot of you have taken a fair number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>science courses are of one form or </v>

419
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:40.800
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

420
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.720
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what you're taught when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught how to do science is how to </v>

421
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:45.720
<v Speaker 1>generate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 1>how to lay out an experiment property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get the methodology right,</v>

423
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.210
<v Speaker 1>how to do the analysis properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe how to structure the,</v>

424
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.960
<v Speaker 1>the revealing of your findings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper scientific format,</v>

425
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how to test a hypothesis.</v>

426
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.640
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that you never </v>
<v Speaker 1>really told about is,</v>

427
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:05.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you generate the </v>

428
00:22:05.641 --> 00:22:05.641
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses to begin with because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

429
00:22:05.641 --> 00:22:09.630
<v Speaker 1>really that's at least half the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's probably a lot more than half </v>

430
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:14.611
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of being a scientist is the </v>

431
00:22:14.611 --> 00:22:18.121
<v Speaker 1>ability to be a hypothesis generator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the hypothesis test or maybe </v>

432
00:22:18.121 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you need to be both to be a true </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>

433
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not.</v>

434
00:22:23.561 --> 00:22:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can just generate </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary hypothesis.</v>

435
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:31.081
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly the case that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dostoevsky Nietzsche were </v>

436
00:22:31.081 --> 00:22:32.710
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably good hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generators.</v>

437
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.760
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

438
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:38.080
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking in many ways underlies </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire development of thought.</v>

439
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:43.340
<v Speaker 1>This sort of thought that you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to encounter in university </v>

440
00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.871
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're thinking underlies the entire </v>

441
00:22:45.871 --> 00:22:47.911
<v Speaker 1>development of the edifice of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say both scientific and </v>

442
00:22:47.911 --> 00:22:49.990
<v Speaker 1>nonscientific thought across the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire 20th century,</v>

443
00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:55.650
<v Speaker 1>and so it's quite entertaining to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>down there and wander around the roots </v>

444
00:22:56.171 --> 00:23:01.171
<v Speaker 1>of these sorts of things because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out how things are linked together </v>

445
00:23:01.171 --> 00:23:03.610
<v Speaker 1>and why they're linked together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they develop and what that means and</v>

446
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.880
<v Speaker 1>also what it means for you to have those</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and why you have them and what </v>

447
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:08.950
<v Speaker 1>role they play in your life.</v>

448
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:11.760
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

449
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:16.770
<v Speaker 1>so after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much in some sense you </v>

450
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.531
<v Speaker 1>might think that's where the clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>and philosophical part of the course </v>

451
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:24.970
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm a clinical psychologist and most</v>

452
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:29.971
<v Speaker 1>of the people who are great personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists were clinical psychologists </v>

453
00:23:29.971 --> 00:23:33.511
<v Speaker 1>and that explains to some degree wind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first part of the course is </v>

454
00:23:33.511 --> 00:23:36.040
<v Speaker 1>philosophical because the thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychologists and psychiatrists</v>

455
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:41.041
<v Speaker 1>and medical doctors for that matter is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not exactly scientists.</v>

456
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.680
<v Speaker 1>They're more like engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what an engineer to do.</v>

457
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:50.681
<v Speaker 1>They might engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might use scientific knowledge and you </v>

458
00:23:50.681 --> 00:23:50.681
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for them.</v>

459
00:23:50.681 --> 00:23:54.220
<v Speaker 1>They should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really what they want to do is make </v>

460
00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:54.220
<v Speaker 1>something changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to build something.</v>

461
00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.530
<v Speaker 1>They want to transform something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to act on the world in a,</v>

462
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.440
<v Speaker 1>in a beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally in a beneficial way.</v>

463
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.580
<v Speaker 1>While the same thing as the case with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the health domains.</v>

464
00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.790
<v Speaker 1>So like someone comes to you with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological problem.</v>

465
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.590
<v Speaker 1>What you want to do is you want to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>it better and better is not a scientific</v>

466
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:16.100
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to the degree that you're a practice,</v>

467
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.030
<v Speaker 1>like you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

468
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:19.460
<v Speaker 1>it's scientific because worst means </v>
<v Speaker 1>abnormal.</v>

469
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:22.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make that case,</v>

470
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:27.101
<v Speaker 1>but it's shallow because there's lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times when you don't consider normal </v>

471
00:24:27.101 --> 00:24:27.380
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

472
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.660
<v Speaker 1>you can send her exceptional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

473
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

474
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.760
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you consider exceptional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desirable and desirable.</v>

475
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:36.890
<v Speaker 1>It might even be better than healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

476
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:41.891
<v Speaker 1>So you can't get out of the value domain</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to interact with </v>

477
00:24:41.891 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 1>people and sort out their lives because </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly what you're,</v>

478
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.790
<v Speaker 1>what you're always asking is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong?</v>

479
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.520
<v Speaker 1>What's the matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you dissatisfied?</v>

480
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Why are you suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you productive?</v>

481
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Why do you fight with everyone you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't you sleep at night?</v>

482
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Why do you wake up screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.870
<v Speaker 1>why can't you pursue anything that's two</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old benefit?</v>

484
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Why do you hurt everyone that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 1>those are moral questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next problem is,</v>

486
00:25:08.781 --> 00:25:10.250
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are we gonna do about it?</v>

487
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:15.280
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you like your life to look if </v>

488
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.921
<v Speaker 1>it could look the way you wanted it to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then how are we going to get from </v>

489
00:25:17.921 --> 00:25:21.130
<v Speaker 1>where you are to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are all their engineering </v>

490
00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.551
<v Speaker 1>questions in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but above all their ethical questions </v>

491
00:25:24.551 --> 00:25:25.660
<v Speaker 1>because they deal with how to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

492
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to just slide over that big</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's generally what happens </v>

493
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.800
<v Speaker 1>because physicians and clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and psychiatrists,</v>

494
00:25:33.801 --> 00:25:38.801
<v Speaker 1>even though their physicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like to think that what they're </v>

495
00:25:38.801 --> 00:25:40.430
<v Speaker 1>doing is science and that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's informed by science,</v>

496
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.200
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the same thing.</v>

497
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.200
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly true with doctors </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not even trained to be </v>

498
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:47.200
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

499
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's that.</v>

500
00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 1>So then the next part of the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last half,</v>

501
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.080
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it concentrates on two elements of </v>

502
00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.070
<v Speaker 1>personality theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more modern elements I would say,</v>

503
00:25:58.071 --> 00:26:03.071
<v Speaker 1>although not more valuable necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that I'm partly very </v>

504
00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:09.910
<v Speaker 1>neurobiological because we made a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>strides in the last 5,000</v>

505
00:26:11.511 --> 00:26:12.260
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

506
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.200
<v Speaker 1>in understanding the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

507
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.860
<v Speaker 1>the structure and the function of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

508
00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Like the things we don't know about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

509
00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

510
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.200
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of things we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand about the brain.</v>

511
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.860
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

512
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:33.310
<v Speaker 1>what its relationship is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness except that more or less </v>

513
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.070
<v Speaker 1>it seems necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

514
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:39.340
<v Speaker 1>so all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even even that you can dispute to some </v>

515
00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.981
<v Speaker 1>degree because they're great case </v>
<v Speaker 1>histories of people who were born with </v>

516
00:26:41.981 --> 00:26:45.461
<v Speaker 1>hydrocephalus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that your skull </v>

517
00:26:45.461 --> 00:26:45.461
<v Speaker 1>basically fills with water.</v>

518
00:26:45.461 --> 00:26:49.380
<v Speaker 1>And the most famous case of that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>French guy who,</v>

519
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:54.381
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went for an Mri for God only knows what </v>

520
00:26:54.381 --> 00:26:57.231
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had nothing to do with with what was </v>

521
00:26:57.231 --> 00:26:59.751
<v Speaker 1>eventually discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he only had five percent of his </v>

522
00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:02.181
<v Speaker 1>cortical tissue is whole brain has all </v>
<v Speaker 1>head was full of cerebral spinal fluid </v>

523
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:07.550
<v Speaker 1>and the brain was just a little skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the side that was like a balloon </v>

524
00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 1>and as far as they could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing wrong with them.</v>

525
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

526
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.660
<v Speaker 1>isn't that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is all the riff that brain</v>

527
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 1>for you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get the other issue.</v>

528
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever heard of a.</v>

529
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.080
<v Speaker 1>can't remember her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's peppered.</v>

530
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 1>She had a famous parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an African gray.</v>

531
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 1>You can look it up talking African gray </v>
<v Speaker 1>parrot and that damn parent,</v>

532
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:34.310
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing could talk like a four year </v>

533
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.310
<v Speaker 1>old kid.</v>

534
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Way better than any chimpanzee full </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences.</v>

535
00:27:34.921 --> 00:27:37.830
<v Speaker 1>It seemed to know what it was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's apparent,</v>

536
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brain is this big.</v>

537
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.290
<v Speaker 1>So how is that even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

538
00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:49.150
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of things we don't know </v>

539
00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:49.150
<v Speaker 1>about the brain really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's unbelievably complicated.</v>

540
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.230
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we have learned a lot of things that</v>

541
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:57.231
<v Speaker 1>are interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of understand the existence and </v>

542
00:27:57.231 --> 00:27:59.550
<v Speaker 1>the location of the fundamental reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pain and anxiety circuits.</v>

543
00:27:59.551 --> 00:28:00.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are,</v>

544
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.910
<v Speaker 1>those are like discovering major </v>
<v Speaker 1>continents,</v>

545
00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:07.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we understand to some degree how people </v>

546
00:28:07.911 --> 00:28:09.420
<v Speaker 1>learn and under what conditions they </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn and we understand,</v>

547
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I would say to some degree what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental motivations and emotions are</v>

548
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.580
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are not scientific categories,</v>

549
00:28:17.581 --> 00:28:20.430
<v Speaker 1>motivations and emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their linguistic categories.</v>

550
00:28:20.431 --> 00:28:22.840
<v Speaker 1>So what we're stuck with so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

551
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:27.890
<v Speaker 1>we know a fair bit about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying neurobiological basis and I </v>

552
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.420
<v Speaker 1>want to take you through that in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail because for a bunch of reasons,</v>

553
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:35.450
<v Speaker 1>partly because it provides a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific underpinning to a lot of the </v>

554
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.910
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses and presuppositions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle analysis.</v>

555
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

556
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Freud hypothesized the existence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

557
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Now there is no way I didn't your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter because the</v>

558
00:28:47.441 --> 00:28:52.441
<v Speaker 1>ID,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the ID is a functional </v>

559
00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:52.441
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a tool.</v>

560
00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:54.120
<v Speaker 1>But there are lots of end like </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures in your brain,</v>

561
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:59.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them in particular is the </v>

562
00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus and that thing like human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings like to think that they're really</v>

563
00:29:00.361 --> 00:29:02.400
<v Speaker 1>impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Critical cap is the thing that's,</v>

564
00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:03.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in charge of things.</v>

565
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:08.691
<v Speaker 1>But your hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this little tiny thing that </v>

566
00:29:08.691 --> 00:29:11.781
<v Speaker 1>sits at the top of your spinal cord man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's running you and let you </v>

567
00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:17.151
<v Speaker 1>know as long as you're not hungry or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry or not chasing after sexual </v>

568
00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 1>excitement and not gambling and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted.</v>

569
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:23.940
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you're completely well fed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and warm and comfortable,</v>

570
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.750
<v Speaker 1>then you can think and you're more or </v>
<v Speaker 1>less in control.</v>

571
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:32.930
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as any of those things go as</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight it's subcortical all the way </v>

572
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:33.690
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see this,</v>

573
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:36.360
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conditions like Anorexia,</v>

574
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:37.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Anorexia,</v>

575
00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:41.530
<v Speaker 1>you can think of Anorexia as a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the cortex and the hypothalamus.</v>

576
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:46.531
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you then the only time the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex winds is when the anorexic dies.</v>

577
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Because other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the hypothalamus that wins all the </v>

578
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.691
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is why anorexics cannot stop </v>

579
00:29:54.691 --> 00:29:54.691
<v Speaker 1>themselves from bingeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

580
00:29:54.691 --> 00:29:58.790
<v Speaker 1>so they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll cut their body weight down to </v>

581
00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.710
<v Speaker 1>say 75 percent of what it should be and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hard.</v>

582
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Like you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to starve yourself like </v>

583
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll still binge like mad,</v>

584
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:10.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a whole gallon of ice cream and </v>

585
00:30:10.621 --> 00:30:10.621
<v Speaker 1>two bags of bread and they can't stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

586
00:30:10.621 --> 00:30:14.971
<v Speaker 1>And that's because your hypothalamus </v>
<v Speaker 1>flint would rather you didn't starve to </v>

587
00:30:14.971 --> 00:30:14.971
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

588
00:30:14.971 --> 00:30:18.240
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not on top of the game or </v>

589
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you've been hurt recently and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so your resources or your,</v>

590
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.540
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

591
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:27.690
<v Speaker 1>You're the negative emotion that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>interfering with your cognitive </v>

592
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:31.141
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamus will come up and grab </v>

593
00:30:31.141 --> 00:30:31.141
<v Speaker 1>you and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

594
00:30:31.141 --> 00:30:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you're hungry and it's off to the fridge</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

595
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so two in the morning,</v>

596
00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:36.700
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be eating everything in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in a kind of a daze.</v>

597
00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And you'll snap out of that and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

598
00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:39.580
<v Speaker 1>what the hell was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

599
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:44.581
<v Speaker 1>well that's the end folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's no trivial thing and it's a </v>

600
00:30:44.581 --> 00:30:46.480
<v Speaker 1>good thing too because if it didn't tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you what to do all the time,</v>

601
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:51.520
<v Speaker 1>like think about how foolish you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to breathe voluntarily,</v>

602
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:56.521
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many days do you think you'd go </v>

603
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:56.521
<v Speaker 1>through?</v>

604
00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's like you wake up one day and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour later you'd forget to breathe and </v>

605
00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.060
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like your,</v>

606
00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:05.080
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain doesn't let you do anything </v>

607
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.621
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes care of all that in the </v>

608
00:31:07.621 --> 00:31:07.621
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

609
00:31:07.621 --> 00:31:11.701
<v Speaker 1>because you're just not that smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't know how to digest </v>

610
00:31:11.701 --> 00:31:11.701
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

611
00:31:11.701 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't know how you walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you can do it.</v>

612
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:19.420
<v Speaker 1>So there are very fundamental subsystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them that aren't even conscious,</v>

613
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:21.460
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're neurological,</v>

614
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:26.640
<v Speaker 1>they're doing all the heavy lifting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like your cortex is as long they're all </v>

615
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 1>along for the ride in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of things.</v>

616
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.470
<v Speaker 1>It's in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

617
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

618
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to talk a fair bit about </v>

619
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.480
<v Speaker 1>fundamental brain structures and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>function of those structures.</v>

620
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Because I like functional neuroanatomy.</v>

621
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to know just what the brain</v>

622
00:31:41.411 --> 00:31:46.411
<v Speaker 1>is made out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to know what all the parts </v>

623
00:31:46.411 --> 00:31:48.241
<v Speaker 1>are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's difficult papers in </v>

624
00:31:48.241 --> 00:31:48.241
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swanson,</v>

625
00:31:48.241 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard paper and the grit paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>by gray,</v>

626
00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:56.790
<v Speaker 1>those are papers that were written by I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think genius level neuropsychologists </v>

627
00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:01.230
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put their whole life's work into a </v>

628
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.240
<v Speaker 1>paper and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't pick it up.</v>

629
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:02.080
<v Speaker 1>You're going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

630
00:32:02.081 --> 00:32:03.100
<v Speaker 1>this is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

631
00:32:03.101 --> 00:32:06.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some genius spent 30 years writing it.</v>

632
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're so informative.</v>

633
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:14.610
<v Speaker 1>They're worth the struggle if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the sort of thing you want to </v>

634
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.360
<v Speaker 1>struggle with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the biological end.</v>

635
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:18.800
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the psychometric ended </v>
<v Speaker 1>site,</v>

636
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:23.850
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unpopular field of psychology even </v>

637
00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:27.301
<v Speaker 1>amongst psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that </v>

638
00:32:27.301 --> 00:32:29.670
<v Speaker 1>psychometric nutrition's I guess have </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually discovered things and people </v>

639
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:30.490
<v Speaker 1>hate what they've discovered.</v>

640
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 1>So and no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

641
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:35.870
<v Speaker 1>it was people who do psychometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers actually who in,</v>

642
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.740
<v Speaker 1>who entered psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who discovered intelligence,</v>

643
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.380
<v Speaker 1>technical psychometric intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq.</v>

644
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.430
<v Speaker 1>And people will tell you there's lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of intelligence.</v>

645
00:32:45.431 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

646
00:32:46.191 --> 00:32:48.440
<v Speaker 1>there aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong,</v>

647
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:53.830
<v Speaker 1>and it's wrong in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The statistics that psychologists use </v>

648
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.030
<v Speaker 1>were invented by the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered Iq,</v>

649
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.900
<v Speaker 1>and that means every single thing that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist has ever claimed that's </v>

650
00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.390
<v Speaker 1>been verified in some way using some </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical process has been verified,</v>

651
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.730
<v Speaker 1>verified the same way that I knew was </v>
<v Speaker 1>verified.</v>

652
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.680
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't get to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

653
00:33:09.681 --> 00:33:14.681
<v Speaker 1>the ICU stuffs in valid without saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of psychology and a lot of other </v>

654
00:33:14.681 --> 00:33:16.370
<v Speaker 1>fields is invalid too because it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same methods of proof.</v>

655
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:21.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's even worse than that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the relationship between Iq and </v>

656
00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.661
<v Speaker 1>life success is way stronger than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between almost any other </v>

657
00:33:25.661 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 1>psychological phenomena and almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

658
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.020
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you guys even know,</v>

659
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

660
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:37.570
<v Speaker 1>you're all far above average in </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence because otherwise you </v>

661
00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be here like at least 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth percentile.</v>

662
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:43.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's something to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of that is determined by </v>

663
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:43.360
<v Speaker 1>biological factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

664
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 1>So a huge chunk of the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're here is because you know,</v>

665
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:50.681
<v Speaker 1>you won the genetic lottery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like hooray for you and no one's </v>

666
00:33:50.681 --> 00:33:51.830
<v Speaker 1>screwed it up too badly as you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up,</v>

667
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even among you guys,</v>

668
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.080
<v Speaker 1>that correlation between your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and your and your grade </v>

669
00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.040
<v Speaker 1>point average is quite high even though </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a truncated sample,</v>

670
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:06.041
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're all pretty bright and </v>

671
00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:08.261
<v Speaker 1>even though there's a lot of error in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the grade measurement system because it </v>

672
00:34:08.261 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 1>doesn't only index intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still very powerful.</v>

673
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.980
<v Speaker 1>And so the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the peep,</v>

674
00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you controlled for conscientious ness</v>

675
00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:21.011
<v Speaker 1>and other elements of personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can do statistically in 20 </v>

676
00:34:21.011 --> 00:34:25.061
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the 10 percent of the people in </v>

677
00:34:25.061 --> 00:34:25.910
<v Speaker 1>this room who have the highest Iq is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will have the highest income virtually.</v>

678
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

679
00:34:27.111 --> 00:34:29.180
<v Speaker 1>unless some terrible thing happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

680
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.420
<v Speaker 1>you can overcome it to some degree if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really hardworking because then </v>

681
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:34.550
<v Speaker 1>that's conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

682
00:34:34.551 --> 00:34:39.551
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's also a trait which seems to </v>

683
00:34:39.551 --> 00:34:39.560
<v Speaker 1>have quite a heavy biological loading so</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

684
00:34:39.561 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 1>So that's the sort of thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate about psychometricians because they</v>

685
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:48.221
<v Speaker 1>come up with these facts and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts that are really dismal and I can </v>

686
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:49.520
<v Speaker 1>give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

687
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:54.710
<v Speaker 1>so you guys all have an Iq of over 150,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

688
00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:00.040
<v Speaker 1>100 makes you about as smart as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical high school reading 115.</v>

689
00:35:00.381 --> 00:35:04.870
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the low end for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for managing the rigors of a,</v>

690
00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:08.220
<v Speaker 1>a fairly high end university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

691
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.420
<v Speaker 1>1:15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still going to have a lot of </v>

692
00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:13.420
<v Speaker 1>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to work like mad.</v>

693
00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:13.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>

694
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:18.761
<v Speaker 1>so 150.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's one standard deviation above </v>

695
00:35:18.761 --> 00:35:18.770
<v Speaker 1>the mean.</v>

696
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.550
<v Speaker 1>One standard deviation below the mean is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Iq of 85.</v>

697
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Now there's just as many people out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the world who have an Iq of 85 </v>

698
00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.760
<v Speaker 1>as there are people who are able to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to college.</v>

699
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

700
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:36.700
<v Speaker 1>what can you do if you have an Iq of 85 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

701
00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one answer.</v>

702
00:35:37.891 --> 00:35:42.891
<v Speaker 1>So the US army has been doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometric testing for 100 and some </v>

703
00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:42.891
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

704
00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:47.570
<v Speaker 1>for a whole bunch of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've done a lot in the basic </v>

705
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:47.570
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

706
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:51.140
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing about the u s army is they </v>

707
00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.321
<v Speaker 1>like to have recruits and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why because do you really </v>

708
00:35:54.321 --> 00:35:56.910
<v Speaker 1>want to go off somewhere and get shot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is generally no.</v>

709
00:35:56.911 --> 00:36:01.911
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like there were people </v>
<v Speaker 1>lining up to get into the army even in </v>

710
00:36:01.911 --> 00:36:01.911
<v Speaker 1>peace time.</v>

711
00:36:01.911 --> 00:36:06.680
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the Americans have used the US </v>

712
00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.140
<v Speaker 1>army as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

713
00:36:07.141 --> 00:36:10.050
<v Speaker 1>imagine you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an underclass of people who aren't doing</v>

714
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:15.051
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the case in every society and </v>

715
00:36:15.051 --> 00:36:15.051
<v Speaker 1>you want to boost some of them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

716
00:36:15.051 --> 00:36:17.220
<v Speaker 1>into something resembling the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

717
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:22.430
<v Speaker 1>You can do that fairly effectively by </v>
<v Speaker 1>inducting the young men in particular </v>

718
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:23.000
<v Speaker 1>into the army because they get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

719
00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get some discipline and maybe they </v>

720
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 1>can kind clamber up into the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

721
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.971
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a lot of policy reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A why the American army or enforces want</v>

722
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:34.500
<v Speaker 1>people and be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

723
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.170
<v Speaker 1>just to be in the army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also for social reasons,</v>

724
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:42.470
<v Speaker 1>positive social reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not likely not to let you in </v>

725
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.480
<v Speaker 1>the the consequences of 100 years of Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing was the PR was the establishment</v>

726
00:36:48.091 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 1>of a law in the United States.</v>

727
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You cannot induct anyone into the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot accept them into the army.</v>

728
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:57.990
<v Speaker 1>If they have an Iq of less than 82,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 10 percent of the population.</v>

729
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:04.130
<v Speaker 1>So you think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means one person in 10 cannot do </v>

730
00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.880
<v Speaker 1>anything that is a positive value in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

731
00:37:08.881 --> 00:37:13.881
<v Speaker 1>It's rather complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not more complex than other </v>

732
00:37:13.881 --> 00:37:14.700
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's desperate for people.</v>

733
00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Nothing they can offer has positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

734
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:21.510
<v Speaker 1>It's worse to have them in the army than</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to have them there at all.</v>

735
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that that's a terrible way </v>

736
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:27.170
<v Speaker 1>of putting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

737
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible statistic because it </v>

738
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 1>also means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

739
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.020
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the army as roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the world in some sense,</v>

740
00:37:34.021 --> 00:37:39.021
<v Speaker 1>in terms of its complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that there's 10 percent of the </v>

741
00:37:39.021 --> 00:37:42.270
<v Speaker 1>population who just cannot really exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in a complex cognitive society.</v>

742
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.700
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

743
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something should be done about that.</v>

744
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:51.441
<v Speaker 1>It's like good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People had been trying to do something </v>

745
00:37:51.441 --> 00:37:52.680
<v Speaker 1>about that for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been billions,</v>

746
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:57.681
<v Speaker 1>if not trillions of dollars poured into </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to do cognitive remediation in </v>

747
00:37:57.841 --> 00:38:02.841
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention that we actually have an </v>

748
00:38:02.841 --> 00:38:03.990
<v Speaker 1>education system and the cool is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually make people smarter.</v>

749
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.830
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to talk a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics.</v>

750
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about the psychometricians</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they're basically brute force </v>

751
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:13.990
<v Speaker 1>statisticians in some ways they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheoretical,</v>

752
00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they use computer power roughly </v>

753
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.461
<v Speaker 1>speaking and advanced statistical </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques to look at large data sets </v>

754
00:38:22.461 --> 00:38:23.210
<v Speaker 1>and extract out patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

755
00:38:23.211 --> 00:38:28.211
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hated the big five when I first came </v>

756
00:38:28.211 --> 00:38:28.211
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

757
00:38:28.211 --> 00:38:28.211
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is boring.</v>

758
00:38:28.211 --> 00:38:31.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no theory behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not prescriptive,</v>

759
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not interested in any literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

760
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't have a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

761
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 1>it came out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so dry,</v>

762
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.050
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

763
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:42.760
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

764
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.160
<v Speaker 1>that's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to spend a lot of time on</v>

765
00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:53.161
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lab two has done a fair bit of work </v>

766
00:38:53.161 --> 00:38:54.910
<v Speaker 1>over the last 10 years elaborating out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big five models.</v>

767
00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:59.911
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we'll talk about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big 10 model and what it does </v>

768
00:38:59.911 --> 00:39:01.840
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is break each of the five into two,</v>

769
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:07.140
<v Speaker 1>we call them aspects and they're pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting like they predict political </v>

770
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:07.140
<v Speaker 1>belief for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite nicely.</v>

771
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:10.600
<v Speaker 1>So conservatives tend to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly,</v>

772
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.330
<v Speaker 1>which is part of conscientiousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less creative,</v>

773
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.680
<v Speaker 1>less open and liberals tend to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>open and less conscientious,</v>

774
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:22.800
<v Speaker 1>which a cynic would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're so into income </v>

775
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:22.840
<v Speaker 1>redistribution because they actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't work.</v>

776
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:28.380
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives work like mad and the </v>

777
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:28.380
<v Speaker 1>liberals say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

778
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:28.750
<v Speaker 1>how about some of that money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.060
<v Speaker 1>the system is unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Conservatives say,</v>

780
00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:36.061
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we worked hard and we're not giving you </v>

781
00:39:36.061 --> 00:39:36.061
<v Speaker 1>any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

782
00:39:36.061 --> 00:39:37.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both have flaws in their theories.</v>

783
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.390
<v Speaker 1>But liberals by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make very good entrepreneurs like.</v>

784
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me rephrase that.</v>

785
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Most entrepreneurs are liberal in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>political outlook and that's because </v>

786
00:39:47.531 --> 00:39:52.531
<v Speaker 1>they're high in openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way it really seems to work is </v>

787
00:39:52.531 --> 00:39:54.550
<v Speaker 1>that liberal minded people start </v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses and conservatives run the.</v>

788
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.890
<v Speaker 1>So they're necessary for one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

789
00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the liberals being open,</v>

790
00:39:59.391 --> 00:40:00.920
<v Speaker 1>they're often the next idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

791
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.370
<v Speaker 1>and they don't want to attend to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn details.</v>

792
00:40:03.371 --> 00:40:05.650
<v Speaker 1>They get bored by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not particularly orderly,</v>

793
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you've established a process </v>

794
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.261
<v Speaker 1>and it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need someone to watch to make sure </v>

795
00:40:13.261 --> 00:40:15.550
<v Speaker 1>the process keeps working well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not very interesting if you're a </v>

796
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.550
<v Speaker 1>creative person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

797
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's basically that.</v>

798
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:26.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now what are we doing time here?</v>

799
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:35.630
<v Speaker 1>So I think what I'll do now is I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell you a story and you're going to </v>

800
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:37.170
<v Speaker 1>think it has absolutely nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with what we've been talking about,</v>

801
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.540
<v Speaker 1>but it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's okay.</v>

802
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.080
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I picked this weird picture.</v>

803
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:53.260
<v Speaker 1>It's the picture of Jonah Biblical </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

804
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.600
<v Speaker 1>so 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old story.</v>

805
00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:00.190
<v Speaker 1>So that's a pretty old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generally if a story is 2,500</v>

806
00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:02.170
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot older than that,</v>

807
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:07.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just happened to be written down </v>

808
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:07.440
<v Speaker 1>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

809
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.260
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that long ago it wasn't like there were </v>

810
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.560
<v Speaker 1>novels and books and that you could find</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 different stories,</v>

811
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at your fingertips.</v>

812
00:41:12.881 --> 00:41:17.881
<v Speaker 1>There were a few stories and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew them and God only knows how long </v>

813
00:41:17.881 --> 00:41:17.881
<v Speaker 1>they been around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a very,</v>

814
00:41:17.881 --> 00:41:18.610
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

815
00:41:18.611 --> 00:41:21.850
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was written down 2,500</v>

816
00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:22.270
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

817
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.730
<v Speaker 1>But we don't really have any idea how </v>
<v Speaker 1>old it is.</v>

818
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost infinitely old at least on </v>

819
00:41:30.851 --> 00:41:35.851
<v Speaker 1>any human scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you see this picture and what you </v>

820
00:41:35.851 --> 00:41:37.040
<v Speaker 1>see is this thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

821
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a medieval idea of a whale is what </v>

822
00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:42.610
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

823
00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:46.361
<v Speaker 1>when you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that isn't really what a whale </v>

824
00:41:46.361 --> 00:41:48.041
<v Speaker 1>looks like and that's kind of right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a medieval Wale wasn't the whale </v>

825
00:41:48.041 --> 00:41:53.021
<v Speaker 1>that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whale in medieval times meant </v>

826
00:41:53.021 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying underwater thing,</v>

827
00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:59.810
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe that was maybe a giant </v>

828
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:00.640
<v Speaker 1>squid was a whale and the whale was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whale in the shark was a whale,</v>

829
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the categories not to save.</v>

830
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:08.590
<v Speaker 1>So that kind of accounts for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in pure ignorance is what accounts </v>

831
00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 1>for the kind of strange mythologized </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

832
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:14.390
<v Speaker 1>But it's still a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

833
00:42:14.391 --> 00:42:19.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just a little generalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what he's doing is vomiting Jonah up</v>

834
00:42:19.131 --> 00:42:21.230
<v Speaker 1>onto dry land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

835
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And you think that's pretty damn weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have Seen Pinocchio?</v>

836
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

837
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.250
<v Speaker 1>how many of you haven't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Haven't Seen Pinocchio?</v>

838
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.930
<v Speaker 1>What kind of parents did you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything?</v>

839
00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Are you Remembering Pinocchio?</v>

840
00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Father stuck in,</v>

841
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:43.871
<v Speaker 1>away away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Pinocchio asked to go down </v>

842
00:42:43.871 --> 00:42:45.941
<v Speaker 1>there and rescue them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you didn't notice </v>

843
00:42:45.941 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 1>when you were watching Pinocchio is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>how daft that is.</v>

844
00:42:47.991 --> 00:42:52.991
<v Speaker 1>There you are sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching a puppet go down into </v>

845
00:42:52.991 --> 00:42:55.610
<v Speaker 1>the ocean to rescue his father from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whale.</v>

846
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.910
<v Speaker 1>And you think that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

847
00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:01.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's interesting.</v>

848
00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

849
00:43:02.451 --> 00:43:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Why does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does that make sense?</v>

850
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Because it doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

851
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.550
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see,</v>

852
00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:15.570
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example of the grip of an </v>

853
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.101
<v Speaker 1>archetypal idea because in archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas a very deep and old idea that </v>

854
00:43:18.201 --> 00:43:23.201
<v Speaker 1>makes sense to you even though if </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone points out to you that you </v>

855
00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:26.141
<v Speaker 1>believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which more or less do while you're </v>

856
00:43:26.141 --> 00:43:26.141
<v Speaker 1>watching the movie you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

857
00:43:26.141 --> 00:43:30.611
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird that I believe that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like kill and that isn't a puppet going </v>

858
00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:33.890
<v Speaker 1>down into the ocean to rescue his father</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a whale either.</v>

859
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a drawing of a puppet going down </v>

860
00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:38.890
<v Speaker 1>into the ocean to rescue is far from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whale.</v>

861
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:43.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's like divorced from reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life in all sorts of ways.</v>

862
00:43:43.491 --> 00:43:48.491
<v Speaker 1>But what's so interesting is you go into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theater and watch something like </v>

863
00:43:48.491 --> 00:43:51.911
<v Speaker 1>that there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone taps you on the shoulder and </v>

864
00:43:51.911 --> 00:43:51.911
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

865
00:43:51.911 --> 00:43:51.911
<v Speaker 1>do you know what you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

866
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:54.140
<v Speaker 1>why don't you shut up and let me watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>

867
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't notice.</v>

868
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very peculiar.</v>

869
00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Very peculiar thing sitting here </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this and not noticing how </v>

870
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 1>strange I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

871
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.100
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

872
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.250
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why I'm going to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>this story because.</v>

873
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Because it's true even though it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

874
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.010
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a funny thing.</v>

875
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange professor at the University</v>

876
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.480
<v Speaker 1>of Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died a few years ago.</v>

877
00:44:20.481 --> 00:44:25.481
<v Speaker 1>He got on a bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in Winnipeg and he never </v>

878
00:44:25.481 --> 00:44:25.481
<v Speaker 1>got off the bus and no one ever saw him </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

879
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.710
<v Speaker 1>So he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd been a prison psychologist.</v>

880
00:44:27.711 --> 00:44:30.740
<v Speaker 1>He worked in the maximum security prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>in University of Alberta.</v>

881
00:44:30.741 --> 00:44:34.830
<v Speaker 1>So who maybe he met one of his old </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients,</v>

882
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible,</v>

883
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:37.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strange ending.</v>

884
00:44:37.681 --> 00:44:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time we were talking about fiction,</v>

885
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:42.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

886
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:47.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said fiction is a lie that can tell </v>

887
00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:50.841
<v Speaker 1>you the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting way of </v>

888
00:44:50.841 --> 00:44:50.841
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

889
00:44:50.841 --> 00:44:54.360
<v Speaker 1>because you read fiction and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true,</v>

890
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obviously because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really about a thing that actually </v>

891
00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:03.741
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more than that some ways </v>

892
00:45:03.741 --> 00:45:06.501
<v Speaker 1>because if it's good fixture it's about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of things that happened </v>

893
00:45:06.501 --> 00:45:06.960
<v Speaker 1>sort of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

894
00:45:06.961 --> 00:45:11.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a distillation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone tells you a long story</v>

895
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:12.720
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

896
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:17.750
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked to your partner and they </v>

897
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:18.150
<v Speaker 1>asked you what was that all about and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you tell them in two sentences what</v>

898
00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:18.630
<v Speaker 1>it was about.</v>

899
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:20.520
<v Speaker 1>You boil it down to the just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

900
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Well a really good story is the gist of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and some of the really old </v>

901
00:45:26.251 --> 00:45:28.500
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the really weird ones like Jonah and the</v>

902
00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:30.770
<v Speaker 1>whale for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which as I said is,</v>

903
00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:33.740
<v Speaker 1>is told to some degree in the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio there,</v>

904
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:38.750
<v Speaker 1>the gist of a lot of things and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been boiling those damn stories </v>

905
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:40.140
<v Speaker 1>down for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a very,</v>

906
00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:40.890
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

907
00:45:40.891 --> 00:45:41.880
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

908
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.940
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people over thousands of </v>

909
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:52.130
<v Speaker 1>years and they come up with these weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that people remember and then </v>

910
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.500
<v Speaker 1>people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

911
00:45:52.501 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 1>they're real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

912
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:53.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

913
00:45:53.911 --> 00:45:56.220
<v Speaker 1>but they're not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way of scientific story is real.</v>

914
00:45:56.221 --> 00:45:58.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a different kind of real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

915
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.220
<v Speaker 1>here's the story of Jonah.</v>

916
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:07.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's an old Jewish story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a very intimidating in </v>

917
00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.670
<v Speaker 1>the Korean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know that variance.</v>

918
00:46:10.671 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there isn't.</v>

919
00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Lives in 500 BC and uh,</v>

920
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.980
<v Speaker 1>God has a chat with them one day and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

921
00:46:19.981 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah there,</v>

922
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.620
<v Speaker 1>there's this city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineveh,</v>

923
00:46:22.621 --> 00:46:24.710
<v Speaker 1>and the people there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

924
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:30.320
<v Speaker 1>they're really not on the straight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow and things are going to go to </v>

925
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.940
<v Speaker 1>hell in a handbasket very rapidly if </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone doesn't do something about that.</v>

926
00:46:32.941 --> 00:46:35.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think that you should go to Nineveh</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should tell the king and all the</v>

927
00:46:35.731 --> 00:46:37.530
<v Speaker 1>people that are there that are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

928
00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:42.780
<v Speaker 1>they're just not doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jonah being a perfectly intelligent </v>

929
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.240
<v Speaker 1>person says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want me to go to a city and you want</v>

930
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:49.490
<v Speaker 1>to go meet me to tell the king like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian die who has absolute power</v>

931
00:46:49.491 --> 00:46:54.491
<v Speaker 1>of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's something wrong with what </v>

932
00:46:54.491 --> 00:46:54.491
<v Speaker 1>he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all of the citizens are corrupt.</v>

933
00:46:54.491 --> 00:46:56.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want me to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jonah says,</v>

934
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.500
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I'm doing that because as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

935
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:03.530
<v Speaker 1>he's a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he runs off and he goes to this town </v>

936
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:07.601
<v Speaker 1>and and as he's reading off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he rents a boat more or less than it's </v>

937
00:47:07.601 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Speaker 1>big boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's fishermen and they're gonna </v>

938
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:11.820
<v Speaker 1>like him somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God can't find them,</v>

939
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.840
<v Speaker 1>which is not going to be an easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so god of course cannot be fooled by</v>

940
00:47:15.841 --> 00:47:20.490
<v Speaker 1>such relatively poorer strategic choices</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's omniscient and all that.</v>

941
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.700
<v Speaker 1>So he's out on the water Jonah and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the fisherman there.</v>

942
00:47:23.701 --> 00:47:26.290
<v Speaker 1>And then some God calls up this big </v>
<v Speaker 1>storm and up.</v>

943
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:31.400
<v Speaker 1>The fishermen are shorting out about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and because they're going to swamp </v>

944
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.651
<v Speaker 1>the boat and then they're all going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>die and they're not that happy about </v>

945
00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:37.081
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they decided to do is throw </v>

946
00:47:37.081 --> 00:47:37.081
<v Speaker 1>everything overboard so that the boat is</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightened,</v>

947
00:47:37.081 --> 00:47:38.860
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't help much because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>storm gets worse.</v>

948
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:42.210
<v Speaker 1>And so then all of them start praying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have different gods.</v>

949
00:47:42.211 --> 00:47:44.620
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a little God competition.</v>

950
00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:49.840
<v Speaker 1>One fishermen talks to one God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another fisherman talks to another God </v>

951
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.221
<v Speaker 1>and nothing's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Joe and it happens to be asleep in </v>

952
00:47:53.221 --> 00:47:57.091
<v Speaker 1>the hold of the ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's already told them that he's </v>

953
00:47:57.091 --> 00:47:57.091
<v Speaker 1>been running from his God and so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

954
00:47:57.091 --> 00:48:02.011
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd better go wake up Jonah because </v>

955
00:48:02.011 --> 00:48:02.011
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's the guy that's causing all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trouble.</v>

956
00:48:02.011 --> 00:48:04.970
<v Speaker 1>So they'd go down there and they wake </v>
<v Speaker 1>them up and they asked him about his God</v>

957
00:48:04.971 --> 00:48:06.010
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

958
00:48:06.011 --> 00:48:08.890
<v Speaker 1>my God made the heavens and the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their gods,</v>

959
00:48:08.891 --> 00:48:10.660
<v Speaker 1>they weren't doing anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnificence.</v>

960
00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:12.100
<v Speaker 1>So they're pretty freaked out about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

961
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:17.101
<v Speaker 1>And so they tell Jonas like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you running away from </v>

962
00:48:17.101 --> 00:48:17.101
<v Speaker 1>this guy for it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea.</v>

963
00:48:17.101 --> 00:48:18.100
<v Speaker 1>And Jonah says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

964
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:23.101
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's my fault that this storm </v>

965
00:48:23.101 --> 00:48:25.081
<v Speaker 1>has come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you just throw me over and </v>

966
00:48:25.081 --> 00:48:25.081
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

967
00:48:25.081 --> 00:48:25.081
<v Speaker 1>we can't really do that because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

968
00:48:25.081 --> 00:48:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't run away like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not a murderer or anything,</v>

969
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:33.361
<v Speaker 1>we can't just toss you over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they decided to try to row to </v>

970
00:48:33.361 --> 00:48:33.700
<v Speaker 1>shore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God's not having any of that.</v>

971
00:48:33.701 --> 00:48:36.460
<v Speaker 1>So he raises up a big storm and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting worse and worse.</v>

972
00:48:36.461 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And finally the fishermen say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

973
00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:40.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over you go in,</v>

974
00:48:40.421 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 1>join is into that because he knows he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad guy and so away all swallows them.</v>

975
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

976
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.990
<v Speaker 1>that's probably not exactly right </v>
<v Speaker 1>because first if a whale swallowed you,</v>

977
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.930
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was probably a shark anyways.</v>

978
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're going to be driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>

979
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not a big cavern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

980
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.780
<v Speaker 1>you know the Pinocchio Whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

981
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it's solid and there's no oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your dad.</v>

982
00:49:02.651 --> 00:49:04.900
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah's in the whale.</v>

983
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:10.320
<v Speaker 1>And he's Kinda freaked out by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now he's in a whale and there's </v>

984
00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.801
<v Speaker 1>a storm in God's angry at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing he does is pray and </v>

985
00:49:13.801 --> 00:49:14.620
<v Speaker 1>tell God what an idiot he isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he'd like to be forgiven,</v>

986
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:18.850
<v Speaker 1>and so the whale zips up to shore and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vomit some onto the beach,</v>

987
00:49:18.851 --> 00:49:23.851
<v Speaker 1>which is the very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very undignified mode of arriving </v>

988
00:49:23.851 --> 00:49:24.730
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

989
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.760
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Jonah Story.</v>

990
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:30.430
<v Speaker 1>And then of course Jonah picks himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and he thinks,</v>

991
00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

992
00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:32.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't so good.</v>

993
00:49:32.981 --> 00:49:37.981
<v Speaker 1>It was a little rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe I'm going off to Nineveh </v>

994
00:49:37.981 --> 00:49:40.381
<v Speaker 1>to tell the ninevites or whoever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were that they're just not living </v>

995
00:49:40.381 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 1>properly because that's a lot better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than making God angry,</v>

996
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what with the storms and the </v>

997
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:47.170
<v Speaker 1>fishermen and the whales and all that.</v>

998
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.640
<v Speaker 1>So then he goes off to Nineveh and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells them what's going on in it seems </v>

999
00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.760
<v Speaker 1>to more or less work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1000
00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's a very interesting story and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

1001
00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:56.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did people believe that?</v>

1002
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one question might be,</v>

1003
00:49:58.541 --> 00:49:59.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe that story?</v>

1004
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:03.730
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

1005
00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:09.090
<v Speaker 1>but then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe that's more complex question </v>

1006
00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:09.700
<v Speaker 1>than you might think because it turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that I believe the Pinocchio Story.</v>

1007
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.350
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

1008
00:50:11.351 --> 00:50:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say,</v>

1009
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 1>well it kind of depends on what you mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>by bleed,</v>

1010
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:20.970
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you watched it and while you </v>

1011
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:20.970
<v Speaker 1>were watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1012
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.210
<v Speaker 1>you were into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understood it,</v>

1013
00:50:22.211 --> 00:50:24.550
<v Speaker 1>you didn't want it to be disrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you followed it.</v>

1014
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.320
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you believe it?</v>

1015
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:32.410
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were like a four year old skeptic </v>

1016
00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:32.410
<v Speaker 1>sitting there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1017
00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop it whale.</v>

1018
00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:32.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't add up.</v>

1019
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:38.020
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're acting out your belief in it by </v>

1020
00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:40.211
<v Speaker 1>being engaged in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if someone taps you on the shoulder </v>

1021
00:50:40.211 --> 00:50:41.270
<v Speaker 1>and wakes you up 30 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years later you say,</v>

1022
00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:42.310
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>

1023
00:50:42.311 --> 00:50:43.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1024
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.420
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of remarkable what you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>

1025
00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:48.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you are star wars?</v>

1026
00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Like Aficionados?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1027
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.200
<v Speaker 1>you won't admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you?</v>

1028
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.280
<v Speaker 1>But there's lots of you in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1029
00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.590
