1
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after all that,</v>

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>so welcome to psychology to 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice to see you all here.</v>

3
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm going to do today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:21.441
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start is I'm going to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you an overview of the content of the </v>

5
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.401
<v Speaker 1>course and then I'll give you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overview of the class requirements right</v>

6
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>at the end of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we might as well jump right into</v>

7
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:33.171
<v Speaker 1>the content to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a website,</v>

8
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like blackboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have my own website.</v>

9
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>You can go to Jordan with Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>b Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark palm and underneath there there's a</v>

11
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:48.741
<v Speaker 1>menu that lists all the courses and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>full syllabus is listed there.</v>

12
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 1>So all the information that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to need about the course can be found </v>

13
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including most of the readings,</v>

14
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:59.721
<v Speaker 1>although there is also a textbook which </v>
<v Speaker 1>I presumed a majority of you have </v>

15
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:03.651
<v Speaker 1>already purchased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it also lists the other things that </v>

16
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>you need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what days the tests are going to be</v>

17
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>and what the assignments are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll go over that anyways at the end</v>

18
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>of the clocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

19
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>but to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you what the course is</v>

20
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>about so you can decide whether you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the right class or not.</v>

21
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

22
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>personality is a somewhat peculiar field</v>
<v Speaker 1>of study in psychology because it spans </v>

23
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:40.541
<v Speaker 1>a number of sub disciplines that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly well suited to one another,</v>

24
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.520
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it spans clinical psychology and </v>

25
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>experimental psychology and it also </v>
<v Speaker 1>spans and approach that is associated </v>

26
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:04.421
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally with single individuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an approach that analyzes </v>

27
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.990
<v Speaker 1>individual characteristics in large </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

28
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.140
<v Speaker 1>which is generally what you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>in experimental psychology.</v>

29
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.460
<v Speaker 1>It's also a relatively strange admixture</v>
<v Speaker 1>of philosophy and I would say </v>

30
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.700
<v Speaker 1>engineering and medicine as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and you might think of medicine </v>

31
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:34.511
<v Speaker 1>as a science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not and the reason that it's </v>

32
00:02:34.511 --> 00:02:38.081
<v Speaker 1>not as because it's concerned with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>promotion of health and health is not a </v>

33
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:42.101
<v Speaker 1>scientific category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a category that can't help but be </v>

34
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:44.600
<v Speaker 1>value-laden because you have to decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes health,</v>

35
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>health and what constitutes illness or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes wellness and what </v>

36
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.501
<v Speaker 1>constitutes pathology and there's no way</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that without bringing value </v>

37
00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 1>judgments into the equation.</v>

38
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.140
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly true in psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you're thinking about what </v>

39
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.761
<v Speaker 1>a healthy might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you generally don't merely think in </v>

40
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:07.621
<v Speaker 1>terms of the absence of pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think in terms of the presence of </v>

41
00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>positive traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

42
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>and someone who's fully healthy mentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>and physically.</v>

43
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.870
<v Speaker 1>While the psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the humanistic psychologists </v>

44
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>from the sixties might consider someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's truly psychologically healthy,</v>

45
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:23.071
<v Speaker 1>self actualized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would mean in some sense that </v>

46
00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>they've been able to develop the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirety of their positive potential,</v>

47
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because of these peculiarities,</v>

48
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.330
<v Speaker 1>personality psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the course of course in personality </v>

49
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>psychology has to be pretty wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranging.</v>

50
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And so this course is in fact wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranging.</v>

51
00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:40.830
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

52
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>it brings in elements of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

53
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of moral philosophy and then </v>

54
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>elements that I would consider almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely biological.</v>

55
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.820
<v Speaker 1>And it does that in order to provide you</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a multidimensional view of what it </v>

56
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>means to be a human being.</v>

57
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I have some other principles that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>abide by while I'm teaching this course </v>

58
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.341
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of those is that I don't really </v>

59
00:04:11.341 --> 00:04:14.341
<v Speaker 1>want to tell you about anything that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think you will find useful and </v>

60
00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a difference between a fact</v>

61
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>and a useful fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.340
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go on Google and you can drown </v>

63
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.340
<v Speaker 1>yourself in facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you do that every day,</v>

64
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.950
<v Speaker 1>but a useful fact to me is one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transforms the way that you look at the </v>

65
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.841
<v Speaker 1>world or the way that you act in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world in some manner that you find </v>

66
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.580
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so another way of,</v>

67
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>of describing useful from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is relevant.</v>

68
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the principles I abide by </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I don't really want to teach you</v>

69
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:49.441
<v Speaker 1>anything that isn't relevant and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>criteria for relevant is first isn't </v>

70
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>going to make a difference to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>

71
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:57.811
<v Speaker 1>So are the things that you learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately meaningful to how you </v>

72
00:04:57.811 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>interact with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second is,</v>

73
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>is there some evidence that the facts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be,</v>

74
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.030
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to be presented with </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have some social utility or </v>

75
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 1>some political utility or some economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility.</v>

76
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:13.711
<v Speaker 1>So that the fact that you know them </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a difference to the way that you </v>

77
00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Speaker 1>act in a way that also affects the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people around you.</v>

78
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

79
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.990
<v Speaker 1>it's for those multiple reasons that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought together the material that I </v>

80
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.831
<v Speaker 1>have brought together now that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some factors that you have </v>

81
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:32.490
<v Speaker 1>to take into account</v>

82
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.410
<v Speaker 1>before you take this course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's another personality course </v>

83
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.130
<v Speaker 1>being given at exactly the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

84
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't this semester anyways.</v>

85
00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:45.900
<v Speaker 1>And so it may be that that one's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>suitable for you to network.</v>

86
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you what this one is </v>

87
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.330
<v Speaker 1>going to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if that isn't what you want or if</v>

88
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:56.331
<v Speaker 1>that's not what you're interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you probably shouldn't take this </v>

89
00:05:56.331 --> 00:05:56.760
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first issue is that there's a lot</v>

90
00:05:56.761 --> 00:06:01.761
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't as much reading as there </v>

91
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:02.280
<v Speaker 1>used to be in this course by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

92
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.420
<v Speaker 1>but there's still a lot of reading and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of its original source material,</v>

93
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>both from the personality theorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and then also original source</v>

94
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:18.401
<v Speaker 1>material from empirical papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that not only is there a </v>

95
00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:22.631
<v Speaker 1>lot of reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the readings actually quite </v>

96
00:06:22.631 --> 00:06:22.631
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

97
00:06:22.631 --> 00:06:25.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's useful given the way I </v>

98
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.871
<v Speaker 1>already defined utility to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I believe that reading what I </v>

99
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>present to you is going to be good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

100
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:33.860
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't have time to do a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reading,</v>

101
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to find this course </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrating.</v>

102
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.370
<v Speaker 1>So there's also because of the emphasis </v>
<v Speaker 1>on clinical theoreticians,</v>

103
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>which is a major part of personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

104
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>especially the more classical </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality theory,</v>

105
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is generally the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of personality theory that most</v>

106
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 1>students are most interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

107
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of what I would consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical material and the reason </v>

108
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>it's philosophical is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with how a person should live.</v>

109
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's a much different question </v>
<v Speaker 1>than what a person is.</v>

110
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's how a person should live or </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps how a person might transform </v>

111
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 1>themselves or act in order to transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves so that their personality is,</v>

112
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>

113
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>better now you can substitute healthier </v>
<v Speaker 1>for better.</v>

114
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 1>But in a context like the one we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing,</v>

115
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:31.361
<v Speaker 1>the difference is trivial really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the last thing that I would </v>

116
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:37.031
<v Speaker 1>caution you against is that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture from the reading material so </v>

117
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure even what I'm going</v>

118
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 1>to tell you when I come to class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the material,</v>

119
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to stick to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribed beltline.</v>

120
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you about the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think are important and so with </v>

121
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>luck that'll make the lectures worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>attending and worth listening to.</v>

122
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.360
<v Speaker 1>But if you're more inclined from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamental perspective,</v>

123
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.420
<v Speaker 1>do you want it a course where things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out in a very orderly fashion and </v>

124
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.141
<v Speaker 1>they progress in a linear fashion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's predictable and the lectures </v>

125
00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>reflect the reading material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this is not a good course for you.</v>

126
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 1>And so I would presume that would be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case if you're orderly.</v>

127
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.050
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the subdivisions of the </v>

128
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.481
<v Speaker 1>big five personality trait model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An orderly people tend to be </v>

129
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:32.950
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they like things cut and dried and </v>

130
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.100
<v Speaker 1>laid out in linear fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

131
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm higher in openness and openness is a</v>

132
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:42.161
<v Speaker 1>creative dimension and open people tend </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use relatively loose,</v>

133
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 1>loose associations when they speak and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cover a wide amount of territory.</v>

134
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.080
<v Speaker 1>And so some people would like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you like reading literature for </v>

135
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.310
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably liked this course.</v>

136
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you probably won't.</v>

137
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

138
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.720
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much enough for the </v>

139
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:05.720
<v Speaker 1>warnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

140
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'll tell you what we're going to </v>

141
00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:11.241
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that makes human </v>

142
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 1>beings unique</v>

143
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.820
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that we're self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

144
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.750
<v Speaker 1>you'll see ecologists are people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>study animal behavior,</v>

145
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.980
<v Speaker 1>do relatively elementary tests of self </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness on animals.</v>

146
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.560
<v Speaker 1>So one of the most famous demonstrations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of such self consciousness is the mirror</v>

147
00:09:35.561 --> 00:09:37.870
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in the mirror test,</v>

148
00:09:37.871 --> 00:09:39.850
<v Speaker 1>what you essentially do is you take an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>

149
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe a chimp or maybe a three year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

150
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.530
<v Speaker 1>and you put a lipstick mark on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>forehead or on their nose,</v>

151
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.590
<v Speaker 1>and then you show them a reflection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in the mirror.</v>

152
00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:53.180
<v Speaker 1>And if they wipe off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Jeff,</v>

153
00:09:53.181 --> 00:09:58.181
<v Speaker 1>you're towards the lipstick mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can make the presumption that </v>

154
00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:00.280
<v Speaker 1>they understand that it's them that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being reflected in the mirror,</v>

155
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 1>or at least they understand that well </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that they can use the mirror </v>

156
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.781
<v Speaker 1>as a guide to action with their with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hand or or whatever it is that </v>

157
00:10:09.941 --> 00:10:13.180
<v Speaker 1>they happen to be pointing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reflection now,</v>

158
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.340
<v Speaker 1>dolphin seemed to be able to manage </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

159
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.250
<v Speaker 1>There some members of the core of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

160
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 1>So those are basically crows and ravens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are really smart and they </v>

161
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.541
<v Speaker 1>seem to possess rudimentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfconsciousness said dolphins </v>

162
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:28.810
<v Speaker 1>citations in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whales,</v>

163
00:10:28.811 --> 00:10:32.290
<v Speaker 1>although I don't know if all whales are </v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious because it's,</v>

164
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.660
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get a mirror and big enough</v>

165
00:10:34.661 --> 00:10:35.620
<v Speaker 1>to show a blue whale</v>

166
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:43.160
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's about it.</v>

167
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's a very good </v>

168
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.201
<v Speaker 1>definition of self consciousness really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the mere fact that you can </v>

169
00:10:51.201 --> 00:10:52.800
<v Speaker 1>recognize yourself and it's also not </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair to some animals like dogs,</v>

170
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:55.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because dog would need a smell of mirror</v>

171
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 1>really because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most animals are very,</v>

172
00:10:57.481 --> 00:11:02.481
<v Speaker 1>very smell predicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the brain is structured with the</v>

173
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.420
<v Speaker 1>olfactory system as its core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike us really because our brains are </v>

174
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 1>structured with the visual system at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>core and that makes us rather peculiar,</v>

175
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:15.561
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little unfair to animals like</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs and rats that relied primarily on </v>

176
00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:17.310
<v Speaker 1>olfaction to orient themselves in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

177
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:22.311
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is I don't think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really a very good definition of self </v>

178
00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rudimentary.</v>

179
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

180
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:28.401
<v Speaker 1>that's the first sort of step to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious because if you're fully </v>

181
00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you need two more things.</v>

182
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.260
<v Speaker 1>You need the capacity to imitate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a much more important capacity </v>

183
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>than people generally realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

184
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's a equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance.</v>

185
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>It's of equivalent importance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

186
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.120
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure that you could use </v>

187
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.120
<v Speaker 1>language if you can't imitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

188
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.250
<v Speaker 1>obviously all the words you used are </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the words that other people use.</v>

189
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be very </v>

190
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.511
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even the mere fact that you do speak </v>

191
00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:01.690
<v Speaker 1>means that you're relying on invitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get your point across.</v>

192
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.400
<v Speaker 1>So you need an invitation and the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need invitation is because once you </v>

193
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.701
<v Speaker 1>can imitate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use your body as a </v>

194
00:12:11.701 --> 00:12:14.761
<v Speaker 1>representational structure to represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and other people you can even </v>

195
00:12:14.761 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 1>use your body as a representational </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure to represent yourself,</v>

196
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 1>which you might do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

197
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:22.690
<v Speaker 1>if you're telling a joke at a dinner </v>
<v Speaker 1>party and then you know,</v>

198
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.810
<v Speaker 1>act out of self parody and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>likes so.</v>

199
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:32.310
<v Speaker 1>And then with regards to language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well language obviously enables you to </v>

200
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.581
<v Speaker 1>build sophisticated models of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are well articulated to exchange </v>

201
00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>those with other people and to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

202
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:42.331
<v Speaker 1>so in order to be self conscious you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be able to recognize that you </v>

203
00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 1>exist in this physical envelope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least here and now.</v>

204
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>You need to be able to imitate because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly how you come to understand</v>

205
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.200
<v Speaker 1>yourself and other creatures like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very important part of being </v>

206
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.390
<v Speaker 1>self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

207
00:12:55.391 --> 00:13:00.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything I learned about any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you is also going to help me understand </v>

208
00:13:00.391 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 1>the sort of creature that I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's for good or for evil.</v>

209
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:09.030
<v Speaker 1>And then with language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not only can we articulate our </v>

210
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.300
<v Speaker 1>representations about each other in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

211
00:13:10.301 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>but we can also store those articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations over very,</v>

212
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

213
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:20.161
<v Speaker 1>very long spans of time and we do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly in ritual which is the acting out</v>

214
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:21.970
<v Speaker 1>of a representation.</v>

215
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:27.090
<v Speaker 1>And we do that partly with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories which are in some sense and </v>

216
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.980
<v Speaker 1>articulated representation of an acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

217
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:35.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can think of a story as a </v>

218
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.651
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So drama is behavior representing </v>

219
00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:41.281
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the story is an articulated </v>

220
00:13:41.281 --> 00:13:43.921
<v Speaker 1>representation of a drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we have very old rituals and we have</v>

221
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.950
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old stories and so part of what we </v>

222
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:54.931
<v Speaker 1>do in this course as we go back to as </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the beginning as we can </v>

223
00:13:54.931 --> 00:13:58.171
<v Speaker 1>possibly manage to start to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>how people have understood themselves </v>

224
00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:01.840
<v Speaker 1>and represented themselves across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>span of human history.</v>

225
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.560
<v Speaker 1>And we're doing that because we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to put our current knowledge in </v>

226
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 1>some kind of historical context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is,</v>

227
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that characterizes the</v>

228
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>human personality is that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical phenomenon.</v>

229
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:23.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've heard in many classes </v>

230
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.850
<v Speaker 1>that much of what makes up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality is a cultural construct.</v>

231
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not much of it is or not </v>

232
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.341
<v Speaker 1>isn't really the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly some of it is an important </v>

233
00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:35.071
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a cultural creature and that </v>

234
00:14:35.071 --> 00:14:37.351
<v Speaker 1>means that you have emerged within a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition that's been shaped and in any </v>

235
00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:41.881
<v Speaker 1>number of ways by an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>lengthy historical past or historical </v>

236
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:46.951
<v Speaker 1>and biological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means in part is that </v>

237
00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:50.310
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand your history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's your history as it matters,</v>

238
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily some collection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>

239
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.780
<v Speaker 1>then you don't understand yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

240
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:04.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings in their self conscious </v>

241
00:15:04.781 --> 00:15:04.781
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know how old we are,</v>

242
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:10.570
<v Speaker 1>more or less biologically or genetically</v>
<v Speaker 1>identical creatures to us existed at </v>

243
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 1>least 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

244
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.830
<v Speaker 1>But we seem to have discovered fire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>were able to master it maybe 2 million </v>

245
00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:19.380
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

246
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.530
<v Speaker 1>And that required a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

247
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are,</v>

248
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 1>there are artifacts that indicate a fair</v>
<v Speaker 1>high level of,</v>

249
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.960
<v Speaker 1>of cultural capacity that are at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>

250
00:15:32.961 --> 00:15:35.090
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can't really say when,</v>

251
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.870
<v Speaker 1>when we got fully self conscious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps we might also say that we're not</v>

252
00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Speaker 1>even fully self conscious yet because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.010
<v Speaker 1>really what the hell do you know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>

254
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really,</v>

255
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:44.750
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

256
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:49.751
<v Speaker 1>really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at best you have a partial model of </v>

257
00:15:49.751 --> 00:15:50.780
<v Speaker 1>who you are and that thing fails all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

258
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:55.810
<v Speaker 1>which as you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're always doing things that </v>

259
00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:56.420
<v Speaker 1>surprise you and often not in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly positive way.</v>

260
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.590
<v Speaker 1>So there's no end of mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

261
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:06.790
<v Speaker 1>The upshot of all this is that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to establish the context first.</v>

262
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.390
<v Speaker 1>That's a historical context and I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that two ways.</v>

263
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I want to do is to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you about mythological </v>

264
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.970
<v Speaker 1>representations of personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's more important than you might</v>

265
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:21.590
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

266
00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 1>it's probably more important than you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

267
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm by myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean is the representations of </v>

268
00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:34.721
<v Speaker 1>human beings in extremely long lasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and persistent stories.</v>

269
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:41.890
<v Speaker 1>And so some of those are the stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are found in various religious </v>

270
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.311
<v Speaker 1>traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's oral traditions that </v>

271
00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:47.981
<v Speaker 1>surround those religious traditions just</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that the religious traditions </v>

272
00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:51.491
<v Speaker 1>are written down and there's fairy tales</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of thing and standard </v>

273
00:16:51.491 --> 00:16:55.631
<v Speaker 1>narratives that people use to guide </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves as they move through the </v>

274
00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:59.921
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of the clinical theories that </v>

275
00:16:59.921 --> 00:17:04.571
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Freud's theory and theory and the </v>

276
00:17:04.571 --> 00:17:07.550
<v Speaker 1>theory of the existentialists and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists in the humanists and so</v>

277
00:17:07.551 --> 00:17:12.551
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are variance of those mythological </v>

278
00:17:12.551 --> 00:17:12.551
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

279
00:17:12.551 --> 00:17:14.000
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>neat.</v>

280
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:19.170
<v Speaker 1>You said once that a philosopher was </v>
<v Speaker 1>seldom anything other than the </v>

281
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 1>unconscious advocate of their cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>

282
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:29.290
<v Speaker 1>So what he meant by that was you already</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to the scene with a set of </v>

283
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.410
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

284
00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:32.210
<v Speaker 1>some of those are embedded in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

285
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:33.620
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you walk,</v>

286
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:36.020
<v Speaker 1>when you attend a funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to behave.</v>

287
00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:37.670
<v Speaker 1>He generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're quiet and solemn.</v>

288
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:43.180
<v Speaker 1>You might not be able to explicate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules that a person should follow at a </v>

289
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.210
<v Speaker 1>funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do it now.</v>

290
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:48.770
<v Speaker 1>You could perhaps articulate them press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like you're following those</v>

291
00:17:48.771 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to a funeral,</v>

292
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 1>you just know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone pressed you,</v>

293
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:57.951
<v Speaker 1>you could turn it into a list of rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really more encoded in your </v>

294
00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 1>actual behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just automatically know what to do.</v>

295
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 1>You can tell when you ever.</v>

296
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.980
<v Speaker 1>You interact with someone who's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially fluent,</v>

297
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously processing the way that </v>

298
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.751
<v Speaker 1>they're acting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they're self conscious and </v>

299
00:18:14.751 --> 00:18:14.751
<v Speaker 1>awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just very fluid.</v>

300
00:18:14.751 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 1>It's automatized behavior and it's coded</v>
<v Speaker 1>right into them.</v>

301
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a great philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then according to Nietzsche,</v>

302
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:24.300
<v Speaker 1>at least what you do is you take a look </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how you act and what you think,</v>

303
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 1>and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

304
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:30.681
<v Speaker 1>this is what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much that you're inventing </v>

305
00:18:30.681 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 1>new ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you're articulating the nature</v>

306
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:35.310
<v Speaker 1>of structures that are already there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine,</v>

307
00:18:35.311 --> 00:18:40.311
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're particularly </v>

308
00:18:40.311 --> 00:18:43.521
<v Speaker 1>interested in wolves and so you studied </v>
<v Speaker 1>some wolves and one of the things you </v>

309
00:18:43.521 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 1>see is that the wolves have a dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

310
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:50.901
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a leader and then there is </v>

311
00:18:50.901 --> 00:18:52.470
<v Speaker 1>struggle in the pack to see who's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the dominant leader.</v>

312
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a couple of problems with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

313
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:57.170
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:02.180
<v Speaker 1>if we'll fail and we'll be fight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty evenly matched and they </v>

315
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.811
<v Speaker 1>tear each other to shreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll see is going to come in and </v>

316
00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:08.781
<v Speaker 1>pound both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a particularly useful </v>

317
00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:11.601
<v Speaker 1>strategy for welfare for Wolf B plus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the pack loses the power of Wolf </v>

318
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:14.580
<v Speaker 1>and wolf be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's hard to useful at all.</v>

319
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.850
<v Speaker 1>So what's happened is that wolves have </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved dominance and submission </v>

320
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.661
<v Speaker 1>strategies so that they can figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is going to leave and who is going </v>

321
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:27.420
<v Speaker 1>to follow without having to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of physical combat that's going</v>

322
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:32.421
<v Speaker 1>to result in damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so usually what happens is that the </v>

323
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:36.141
<v Speaker 1>two wolves face off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably seen cats do this when </v>

324
00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:36.141
<v Speaker 1>they encounter each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

325
00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:40.771
<v Speaker 1>other on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they do is sort of </v>

326
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:40.771
<v Speaker 1>turned sideways and they puff themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

327
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:40.771
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

328
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:42.150
<v Speaker 1>And they dance back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite comical.</v>

329
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.360
<v Speaker 1>But what the caps trying to do is look </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and exposed to try and make the </v>

330
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.051
<v Speaker 1>other cat nervous enough to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what was do is roughly the same </v>

331
00:19:51.051 --> 00:19:55.791
<v Speaker 1>thing they puff out so they look big and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make all sorts of ferocious noises </v>

332
00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:59.210
<v Speaker 1>and they threaten each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually what happens is one wolf </v>

333
00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.570
<v Speaker 1>will lose his nerve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flopped down,</v>

334
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:01.860
<v Speaker 1>roll over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show his throat,</v>

335
00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Speaker 1>and that basically means something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm useless and,</v>

336
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:09.830
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pathetic and you can tear out my </v>

337
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 1>throat if you want because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other wolf.</v>

338
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

339
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.080
<v Speaker 1>you are pretty useful and pathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

340
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.760
<v Speaker 1>we're going to need you tomorrow to hunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>down a deer so you know,</v>

341
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.750
<v Speaker 1>you can get up and protect your </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable self and that'll be okay.</v>

342
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were watching that,</v>

343
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 1>you might say we'll just follow rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course they don't.</v>

344
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.360
<v Speaker 1>That's just how wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zach,</v>

345
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.850
<v Speaker 1>when you describe what the wells are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

346
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.550
<v Speaker 1>then you turn it into a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't a rule to begin with.</v>

347
00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:34.320
<v Speaker 1>It was just a pattern of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

348
00:20:34.321 --> 00:20:39.321
<v Speaker 1>human beings are like that were chalked </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of patterns of behavior and </v>

349
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.590
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

350
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:45.950
<v Speaker 1>they're the consequences of our biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something we'll talk about in </v>

351
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 1>depth in the last half of the course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are consequence of our culture</v>

352
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 1>and they're built into our bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every,</v>

353
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 1>every time you interact with another </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

354
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 1>they're telling you how to behave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

355
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Don't be too obtuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to be a little bit witty,</v>

356
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.670
<v Speaker 1>have something interesting to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be too annoying if you're going to</v>

357
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 1>say something funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure it's funny.</v>

358
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Take turns while you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Play nicely,</v>

359
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.170
<v Speaker 1>take your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't eat all the bread,</v>

360
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.400
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

361
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you don't abide by those </v>

362
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.560
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people lift their eyebrow at you or</v>

363
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:25.561
<v Speaker 1>they don't smile at your jokes are they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look at you or they roll their </v>

364
00:21:25.561 --> 00:21:28.561
<v Speaker 1>eyes when you come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really not a good sign by the </v>

365
00:21:28.561 --> 00:21:30.640
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get punished severely for it.</v>

366
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 1>And then if you do act like they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you to act,</v>

367
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:34.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people smile at you and they're,</v>

368
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.200
<v Speaker 1>they invite you to their place for </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner and you know,</v>

369
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have an intimate relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people that like you.</v>

370
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:45.330
<v Speaker 1>And so we're exchanging information </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how we should manifest ourselves </v>

371
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.010
<v Speaker 1>in our bodies with every possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

372
00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.020
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that shapes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that we act.</v>

373
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is or partly is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really understand the consequences</v>

374
00:21:56.171 --> 00:21:57.230
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

375
00:21:57.231 --> 00:22:02.231
<v Speaker 1>you can act it out more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on your social skill and the </v>

376
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:02.290
<v Speaker 1>degree to which you've been exposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

377
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.560
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you're a conscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have that.</v>

378
00:22:05.561 --> 00:22:08.800
<v Speaker 1>You can consciously articulate all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules that underlie that.</v>

379
00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 1>And if you think that maybe you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fine.</v>

380
00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:15.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine a well behaved four year old,</v>

381
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by four,</v>

382
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.320
<v Speaker 1>you've got a lot of the social rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>down because by four you can play with </v>

383
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.260
<v Speaker 1>others if you're ever going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

384
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.930
<v Speaker 1>You can already do it by the time you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

385
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 1>If you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you were four,</v>

386
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:33.150
<v Speaker 1>you are in serious trouble because other</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids won't play with you and then they </v>

387
00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.661
<v Speaker 1>won't teach you how to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you stay immature and isolated </v>

388
00:22:36.661 --> 00:22:39.931
<v Speaker 1>and you know often your little corner </v>
<v Speaker 1>dejected and bitter for the rest of your</v>

389
00:22:40.781 --> 00:22:45.781
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think that's a little </v>

390
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:45.781
<v Speaker 1>rough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

391
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:45.781
<v Speaker 1>That's what the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the data indicate.</v>

392
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.800
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

393
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.370
<v Speaker 1>what this means in part is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

394
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:57.390
<v Speaker 1>we've been shaping how all of us behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as we've been social.</v>

395
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

396
00:23:00.761 --> 00:23:03.370
<v Speaker 1>how long have we been social?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

397
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:08.620
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans are social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So lobsters for example,</v>

398
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 1>organize themselves into dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies and they modify each other's</v>

399
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:17.770
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's $400 million years.</v>

400
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:23.430
<v Speaker 1>So we've been social and living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups since our ancestors departed on </v>

401
00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:31.030
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary timescale from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancestors of lobsters.</v>

402
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

403
00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:37.111
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There weren't any trees around back </v>

404
00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:40.000
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So social life is older than trees,</v>

405
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.080
<v Speaker 1>so you can be sure that you're adapted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it in a major way.</v>

406
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:49.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's built into your biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the historical element </v>

407
00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 1>of it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's quite.</v>

408
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.150
<v Speaker 1>We're quite flexible from a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

409
00:23:54.151 --> 00:23:57.420
<v Speaker 1>So there's an example skier named Robert</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sapolsky,</v>

410
00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.790
<v Speaker 1>who I really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great scientist.</v>

411
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 1>He went off to Africa to study baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baboons are not pleasant generally </v>

412
00:24:06.451 --> 00:24:08.220
<v Speaker 1>speaking there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fight a lot.</v>

413
00:24:08.221 --> 00:24:09.420
<v Speaker 1>They're bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bite.</v>

414
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 1>They can really bite at that boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a predatory cat will think twice </v>

415
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.190
<v Speaker 1>about taking on and by mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got major teeth and their.</v>

416
00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Their temperament is not particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

417
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly went and studied a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>baboons and they were engaged in typical</v>

418
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.640
<v Speaker 1>baboons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gang behavior,</v>

419
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:31.790
<v Speaker 1>harassing each other all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullying each other and they're all </v>

420
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.281
<v Speaker 1>stressed out because he knew that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he measured their levels of </v>

421
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:37.701
<v Speaker 1>stress and their testosterone and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth and so it was pretty miserable </v>

422
00:24:37.701 --> 00:24:38.820
<v Speaker 1>baboons existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what happened was that</v>

423
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:44.190
<v Speaker 1>the baboons went to feed somewhere that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember and they,</v>

424
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:49.280
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them contracted tuberculosis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turned out that almost all the </v>

425
00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.171
<v Speaker 1>hyper aggressive males got tuberculosis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and died and all that was left was the </v>

426
00:24:54.171 --> 00:24:57.981
<v Speaker 1>Beta males roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the whole book by building </v>

427
00:24:57.981 --> 00:25:01.190
<v Speaker 1>culture transformed so that it became </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more agreeable and much more </v>

428
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.401
<v Speaker 1>cooperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when aggressive baboons would </v>

429
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:04.401
<v Speaker 1>move into that territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

430
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:08.040
<v Speaker 1>singly or their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'd get all placid and calm too.</v>

431
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting gay because </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously baboons aren't social to the </v>

432
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.421
<v Speaker 1>degree that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does indicate that even at the </v>

433
00:25:17.421 --> 00:25:18.060
<v Speaker 1>advanced primate level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:20.100
<v Speaker 1>their brains are pretty big but not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>big as ours.</v>

435
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:24.840
<v Speaker 1>But cultural transmission of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation can be quite powerful and it</v>

436
00:25:24.841 --> 00:25:28.800
<v Speaker 1>can transform quite rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

437
00:25:28.801 --> 00:25:31.110
<v Speaker 1>we've been shaping each other's behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a very,</v>

438
00:25:31.111 --> 00:25:31.800
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

439
00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:32.850
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>

440
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:38.570
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that is encoded deeply in </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology and in culture.</v>

441
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically,</v>

442
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.930
<v Speaker 1>when we'll talk about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we get to the biological section,</v>

443
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.500
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways that you can know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>social you are is by noting how hurt and</v>

444
00:25:48.601 --> 00:25:51.390
<v Speaker 1>ashamed you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make a serious social error.</v>

445
00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're at a party and you make a </v>

446
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 1>fool of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

447
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.260
<v Speaker 1>depending on your level of neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a big five trait,</v>

448
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.170
<v Speaker 1>that index is how sensitive you are to </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>

449
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.620
<v Speaker 1>You might obsess about what an idiot you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are for the next three or four months or</v>

450
00:26:04.621 --> 00:26:06.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe even for the next five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

451
00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:11.930
<v Speaker 1>people do not like social exclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you have a little counter </v>

452
00:26:13.201 --> 00:26:15.960
<v Speaker 1>that's more or less built into the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your brain that roughly,</v>

453
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.810
<v Speaker 1>first of all estimates how successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

454
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.770
<v Speaker 1>There's an estimation that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to occur right at birth where when</v>

455
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.800
<v Speaker 1>part of your neuroticism levels are set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that can be modified to some </v>

456
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.740
<v Speaker 1>degree by learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

457
00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:33.741
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a talk baboons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're going to experience less </v>

458
00:26:33.741 --> 00:26:37.290
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion and more satisfaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you are if you're a bottom baboons.</v>

459
00:26:37.291 --> 00:26:39.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's exactly the same with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

460
00:26:39.871 --> 00:26:44.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like to be climbing up dominance </v>

461
00:26:44.871 --> 00:26:47.781
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to be near the top of </v>

462
00:26:47.781 --> 00:26:49.521
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the little counter out the back </v>

463
00:26:49.521 --> 00:26:51.891
<v Speaker 1>of your brain notices that you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a good job of climbing </v>

464
00:26:51.891 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 1>towards the top of irrelevant dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

465
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.830
<v Speaker 1>then it's going to produce more </v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin and you're not going to be as </v>

466
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:58.200
<v Speaker 1>in as much pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be as depressed,</v>

467
00:26:58.201 --> 00:27:03.201
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be as anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be stressed and so </v>

468
00:27:03.201 --> 00:27:03.201
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

469
00:27:03.201 --> 00:27:07.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a biological basis for our </v>

470
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.611
<v Speaker 1>social being and it's extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to us how we fit into social </v>

471
00:27:10.611 --> 00:27:10.611
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

472
00:27:10.611 --> 00:27:15.321
<v Speaker 1>So we've also been trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell we are,</v>

473
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:19.290
<v Speaker 1>who we are for thousands and thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>

474
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Partly as a consequence of invitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

475
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.370
<v Speaker 1>because I can act you out and it'll sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of help me understand what you're like.</v>

476
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:31.670
<v Speaker 1>And partly as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated communication loader that </v>

477
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 1>storytelling now people have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling stories for.</v>

478
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:39.230
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you go and visit peoples that </v>

479
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:44.181
<v Speaker 1>have no written language and who'd been </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated from the rest of human society </v>

480
00:27:44.181 --> 00:27:48.741
<v Speaker 1>for say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of years and such </v>

481
00:27:48.741 --> 00:27:48.960
<v Speaker 1>people still exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find that they tell stories,</v>

482
00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:50.760
<v Speaker 1>they danced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they act each other out,</v>

483
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we know certainly that the propensity</v>

484
00:27:54.601 --> 00:27:59.601
<v Speaker 1>to tell stories and to engage in ritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior is far older than our ability </v>

485
00:27:59.601 --> 00:27:59.601
<v Speaker 1>to write.</v>

486
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I suspect you could push it back at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least 50,000</v>

487
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:05.340
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I suspect it's a lot older than</v>

488
00:28:05.341 --> 00:28:10.341
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happened is that across </v>

489
00:28:10.341 --> 00:28:13.910
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of timescales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've started to tell stories about one </v>

490
00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.820
<v Speaker 1>another that represent how we act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>

491
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:22.821
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those stories are interesting </v>

492
00:28:22.821 --> 00:28:24.441
<v Speaker 1>and memorable and some of them aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we tend to remember the </v>

493
00:28:24.441 --> 00:28:25.140
<v Speaker 1>interesting and memorable ones and pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>them on.</v>

494
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.680
<v Speaker 1>And so you can also imagine human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggregating together in groups of </v>

495
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.460
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of people over </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years telling</v>

496
00:28:35.461 --> 00:28:40.461
<v Speaker 1>their stories to one another and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammering those stories into some sort </v>

497
00:28:40.461 --> 00:28:42.600
<v Speaker 1>of mutually acceptable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensible for.</v>

498
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.900
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one example of that is that if you look </v>

499
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.021
<v Speaker 1>at the creation stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creation story that say occurs in </v>

500
00:28:51.021 --> 00:28:54.291
<v Speaker 1>Genesis in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a member of a class of creation </v>

501
00:28:54.291 --> 00:28:58.701
<v Speaker 1>stories that characterized Middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eastern mythology and it seems to have </v>

502
00:28:58.831 --> 00:29:03.831
<v Speaker 1>arisen out of the organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have separate Middle Eastern tribes </v>

503
00:29:03.831 --> 00:29:08.031
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each with their own traditions into a </v>

504
00:29:08.031 --> 00:29:11.541
<v Speaker 1>relatively homogenous story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized a large group of people,</v>

505
00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:13.170
<v Speaker 1>central beliefs.</v>

506
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:19.100
<v Speaker 1>So we have information about how we act </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the representations that we've made</v>

507
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:26.211
<v Speaker 1>of those actions that we passed forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Lot of those take the form of miss </v>

508
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.750
<v Speaker 1>religious stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of what we're going to do is</v>

509
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:35.751
<v Speaker 1>we're going to begin the course with two</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation establishing themes.</v>

510
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.500
<v Speaker 1>One has to do with the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological representations and the </v>

511
00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:48.421
<v Speaker 1>second has to do with a set of rituals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and processes and beliefs that have been</v>

512
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 1>identified more or less worldwide that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do with shamonic transformation.</v>

513
00:29:55.570 --> 00:30:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the title of this course is personality </v>

514
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.061
<v Speaker 1>and its transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's titled that way is </v>

515
00:30:03.061 --> 00:30:05.881
<v Speaker 1>because you aren't just who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're also something that changes all </v>

516
00:30:06.501 --> 00:30:11.501
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're more like a river than like a </v>

517
00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:11.501
<v Speaker 1>rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're constantly transforming.</v>

518
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.320
<v Speaker 1>The physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Erwin Schrodinger thought that people </v>

519
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.290
<v Speaker 1>were dissipative structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting idea.</v>

520
00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:25.291
<v Speaker 1>So a dissipative structure is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that maintains its structural </v>

521
00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:25.620
<v Speaker 1>integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

522
00:30:25.621 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 1>it's elements transformed completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

523
00:30:28.901 --> 00:30:33.130
<v Speaker 1>when you let the water out of the sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a whirlpool and the whirlpool is</v>

524
00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:35.890
<v Speaker 1>a fairly stable entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the water that the whirlpool is made</v>

525
00:30:35.891 --> 00:30:37.180
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's constantly changing.</v>

526
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a dissipative structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what you're like.</v>

527
00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:45.270
<v Speaker 1>You maintain your form across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your elements are constantly </v>

528
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.500
<v Speaker 1>transforming and people are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very transformative creatures.</v>

529
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

530
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 1>unlike animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because animals are sort of what they </v>

531
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:56.140
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

532
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have some capacity learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not very much.</v>

533
00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Your typical beaver is acting more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less today.</v>

534
00:31:00.501 --> 00:31:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his great,</v>

535
00:31:01.851 --> 00:31:02.480
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

536
00:31:02.481 --> 00:31:05.030
<v Speaker 1>great grandfather was acting 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

537
00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no real accretion of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with human beings,</v>

538
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:14.600
<v Speaker 1>we transformed like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do that culturally,</v>

539
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:16.730
<v Speaker 1>things aren't much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many things,</v>

540
00:31:16.731 --> 00:31:21.731
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are different now than there were </v>

541
00:31:21.731 --> 00:31:22.190
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago that it's almost impossible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manage it and then so we transform on</v>

542
00:31:22.191 --> 00:31:25.280
<v Speaker 1>a cultural scale quite rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also do that individually.</v>

543
00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys have all just made the </v>

544
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:30.580
<v Speaker 1>transition to university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just roughly speaking,</v>

545
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that your like you were in some</v>

546
00:31:33.951 --> 00:31:35.870
<v Speaker 1>ways when you were in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

547
00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.090
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you're better than you were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>

548
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:41.000
<v Speaker 1>A whole bunch of ways as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be more mature,</v>

549
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.580
<v Speaker 1>but your personality may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed substantially.</v>

550
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with any luck you're not done with </v>

551
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.941
<v Speaker 1>your sequences of transformations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that's going to be something </v>

552
00:31:51.941 --> 00:31:55.811
<v Speaker 1>that characterizes you for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life in so far as you're a dynamic </v>

553
00:31:55.811 --> 00:31:56.230
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes are open,</v>

554
00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.730
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you can learn.</v>

555
00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:04.210
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you might say </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the most stable thing there is </v>

556
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.080
<v Speaker 1>about human personality is its capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to transform.</v>

557
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something that's worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>

558
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things I can tell you</v>

559
00:32:10.911 --> 00:32:15.911
<v Speaker 1>about the great myths of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of them and they have </v>

560
00:32:15.911 --> 00:32:19.481
<v Speaker 1>different themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most powerful themes is the </v>

561
00:32:19.481 --> 00:32:22.970
<v Speaker 1>way you get yourself out of trouble is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to transform your personality.</v>

562
00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Now you think you kind of do that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you learn something,</v>

563
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

564
00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Because you learn something in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>little different than you were before,</v>

565
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:35.740
<v Speaker 1>hopefully different in a significant way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully different in a way that </v>

566
00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.010
<v Speaker 1>helps you solve some problems that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't solve before.</v>

567
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:41.600
<v Speaker 1>So you could say one of the late motifs </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being human is,</v>

568
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to encounter an obstacle,</v>

569
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I can just transform and I can figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out some way of getting around it.</v>

570
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:49.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that makes us quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable.</v>

571
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I could suggest </v>

572
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 1>to you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of the largest ideas</v>

573
00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.670
<v Speaker 1>that exist especially communicable in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this short time,</v>

574
00:33:01.671 --> 00:33:06.671
<v Speaker 1>is that it's much better to identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your capacity to transform than it </v>

575
00:33:07.131 --> 00:33:09.140
<v Speaker 1>is to identify with who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

576
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.290
<v Speaker 1>And that can get you out of an awful lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trouble.</v>

577
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that characterizes </v>

578
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:17.470
<v Speaker 1>video logs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

579
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:20.201
<v Speaker 1>or people who are trapped in fixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief systems is that they worship who </v>

580
00:33:20.201 --> 00:33:24.131
<v Speaker 1>they are now and that'd be all fine if </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was going 100 percent for </v>

581
00:33:24.131 --> 00:33:24.740
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's seldom the case.</v>

582
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.460
<v Speaker 1>And so unless your life is perfect and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems highly improbable,</v>

583
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you were someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be better.</v>

584
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all you've got in some sense </v>

585
00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.181
<v Speaker 1>because changing the world in some way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to make you feel better </v>

586
00:33:40.181 --> 00:33:40.490
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

587
00:33:40.491 --> 00:33:45.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to do that in some </v>

588
00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:46.931
<v Speaker 1>small way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that you could or </v>

589
00:33:46.931 --> 00:33:48.890
<v Speaker 1>should try to do that on large scale is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty low.</v>

590
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:54.910
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the mythological representation </v>

591
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.371
<v Speaker 1>section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to you about the </v>

592
00:33:58.371 --> 00:34:00.071
<v Speaker 1>fundamental elements of narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that I think that that's </v>

593
00:34:01.341 --> 00:34:05.480
<v Speaker 1>necessary is because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of two things that you have</v>

594
00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:07.490
<v Speaker 1>to consider when you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

595
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.760
<v Speaker 1>And one is objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a person like?</v>

596
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.980
<v Speaker 1>They'll say what you might think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what a rat is like or maybe even what a </v>

597
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:17.980
<v Speaker 1>rock is like.</v>

598
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.690
<v Speaker 1>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a scientific question in some </v>

599
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.391
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's another question which </v>

600
00:34:25.391 --> 00:34:25.400
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe two questions.</v>

601
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 1>How do people act and how should they </v>
<v Speaker 1>act?</v>

602
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.060
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the first one is a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

603
00:34:32.061 --> 00:34:37.061
<v Speaker 1>but the second one certainly isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that we explore how people </v>

604
00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:41.360
<v Speaker 1>do act and how they should act has a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>more to do with narrative then it has to</v>

605
00:34:41.361 --> 00:34:43.880
<v Speaker 1>do with science and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

606
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.460
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

607
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:50.500
<v Speaker 1>when you think about where do you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of your information about what </v>

608
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.250
<v Speaker 1>people are like when you're not actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>just interacting with some people.</v>

609
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.620
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>

610
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.900
<v Speaker 1>You read novels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he read literature,</v>

611
00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:00.200
<v Speaker 1>you go see movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch a game of thrones,</v>

612
00:35:00.201 --> 00:35:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you've been John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>game of thrones,</v>

613
00:35:02.001 --> 00:35:04.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go watch star wars.</v>

614
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you line up for three days if </v>

615
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:09.440
<v Speaker 1>you're completely insane to go see star </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>

616
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might ask,</v>

617
00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:11.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the world are you doing?</v>

618
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are hungry for information about </v>

619
00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.411
<v Speaker 1>how people do act and how they should </v>
<v Speaker 1>act and we're absolutely compelled by </v>

620
00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:25.010
<v Speaker 1>narratives and there's a reason for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

621
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you kind of know what a narrative is</v>

622
00:35:26.721 --> 00:35:31.721
<v Speaker 1>and one isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to a movie and you think are the </v>

623
00:35:31.721 --> 00:35:32.370
<v Speaker 1>character development is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

624
00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a story it was terrible.</v>

625
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.770
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you talk with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends about why it a terrible story.</v>

626
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:40.350
<v Speaker 1>But the funny thing is you kind of know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

627
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like some things are stories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some things aren't.</v>

628
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.290
<v Speaker 1>And laying out what actually makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

629
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:51.291
<v Speaker 1>a story that's very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still know it and you can come </v>

630
00:35:51.391 --> 00:35:52.990
<v Speaker 1>to some consensus even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

631
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:56.070
<v Speaker 1>if you look on I am deb or rotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes,</v>

632
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:01.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people form large group consensus about </v>

633
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:05.960
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes an acceptable narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn quickly and there seems to </v>

634
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.540
<v Speaker 1>be at least a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement,</v>

635
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barring individual differences.</v>

636
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:14.450
<v Speaker 1>So the mythological and the demonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions that were going to undertake</v>

637
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.960
<v Speaker 1>have a couple of purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is to provide you with the </v>

638
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.050
<v Speaker 1>foundations of a language that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>use to understand narrative,</v>

639
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:33.270
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to prove very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very useful because most of the clinical</v>

640
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:38.510
<v Speaker 1>theories that we're going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>are really narrative based and once you </v>

641
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:40.700
<v Speaker 1>understand their mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>substructure,</v>

642
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:45.710
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a framework within which </v>

643
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.810
<v Speaker 1>you can slot the theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

644
00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:50.811
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated about personality theory is </v>

645
00:36:50.811 --> 00:36:52.470
<v Speaker 1>that there are a lot of personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories and you might think,</v>

646
00:36:52.471 --> 00:36:53.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can that be?</v>

647
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically there can only be one.</v>

648
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.930
<v Speaker 1>There's only one theory of relativity </v>
<v Speaker 1>route.</v>

649
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little fuzzy around the edges,</v>

650
00:37:03.361 --> 00:37:06.960
<v Speaker 1>but people agree on the core elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well with personality theory,</v>

651
00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:09.030
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is many,</v>

652
00:37:09.031 --> 00:37:13.350
<v Speaker 1>many different personality theories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you might think,</v>

653
00:37:13.351 --> 00:37:18.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you supposed to make any sense </v>

654
00:37:18.351 --> 00:37:18.351
<v Speaker 1>out of that?</v>

655
00:37:18.351 --> 00:37:18.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways.</v>

656
00:37:18.351 --> 00:37:21.951
<v Speaker 1>One is to put all of them into a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental underlying structure and </v>

657
00:37:22.021 --> 00:37:27.021
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I'm really going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to strive to have you guys do while </v>

658
00:37:27.021 --> 00:37:29.901
<v Speaker 1>you're taking this course and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to actually adopt a slightly </v>

659
00:37:29.901 --> 00:37:33.651
<v Speaker 1>different set of presuppositions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality theories and so you could </v>

660
00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:33.651
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

661
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.110
<v Speaker 1>there's only one theory of relativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you might say,</v>

662
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:39.000
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only one theory of relativity,</v>

663
00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:44.001
<v Speaker 1>but then consider a tool box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe some of you are relatively </v>

664
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:49.311
<v Speaker 1>handy and you have a tool box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's in the toolbox hammers or a </v>

665
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:52.020
<v Speaker 1>hammer saws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrenches,</v>

666
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.730
<v Speaker 1>pliers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice grips,</v>

667
00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.310
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you might say,</v>

668
00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their tools,</v>

669
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.560
<v Speaker 1>why do you need all those tools?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

670
00:38:04.561 --> 00:38:06.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hammer a nail in with a ranch,</v>

671
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.840
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be a lot better if you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>use a hammer and you can probably bang a</v>

672
00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:14.841
<v Speaker 1>bolt off with a hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be a lot better if you had </v>

673
00:38:14.841 --> 00:38:14.841
<v Speaker 1>a ranch and so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

674
00:38:14.841 --> 00:38:18.390
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and sophisticated,</v>

675
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.610
<v Speaker 1>why not have a bunch of tools?</v>

676
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't generally think of scientific </v>

677
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.020
<v Speaker 1>theories as tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although that is what they are above all</v>

678
00:38:28.021 --> 00:38:33.021
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their tools and then when we're dealing </v>

679
00:38:33.021 --> 00:38:33.021
<v Speaker 1>with something as complicated as a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

680
00:38:33.021 --> 00:38:36.700
<v Speaker 1>while you know we may need more than one</v>
<v Speaker 1>tool to get to the bottom of it and it's</v>

681
00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:41.701
<v Speaker 1>also the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that to say understand that </v>

682
00:38:41.701 --> 00:38:41.701
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

683
00:38:41.701 --> 00:38:43.630
<v Speaker 1>that's a complicated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's guess You might say,</v>

684
00:38:43.631 --> 00:38:44.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

685
00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 1>To what end you don't mean comprehensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal on esc and understanding.</v>

686
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you mean I want to know x </v>
<v Speaker 1>about someone because I have some desire</v>

687
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.880
<v Speaker 1>in relationship to my interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's all sorts of tools that </v>

688
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.381
<v Speaker 1>can facilitate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I would say is that no freud's a</v>

689
00:39:04.951 --> 00:39:08.530
<v Speaker 1>microscope and young as a telescope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of thinking about it.</v>

690
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:13.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no particular reason I </v>

691
00:39:13.531 --> 00:39:13.540
<v Speaker 1>associated either of those with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>two tools,</v>

692
00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:18.541
<v Speaker 1>but the point is is that if you paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful attention to personality </v>

693
00:39:18.541 --> 00:39:22.411
<v Speaker 1>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can expand your capacity to </v>

694
00:39:22.411 --> 00:39:25.951
<v Speaker 1>represent yourself in ways that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely useful because you should </v>

695
00:39:25.951 --> 00:39:29.611
<v Speaker 1>understand who you are and why and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>implications that has for you because </v>

696
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:37.040
<v Speaker 1>you're a transformable creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have a fairly stable </v>

697
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:37.040
<v Speaker 1>underlying sub structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

698
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you just melt like an octopus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're this weird dynamic combination</v>

699
00:39:42.491 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 1>of relatively permanent structure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then embedded capacity to transform.</v>

700
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you have a nature and so understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>your nature is extraordinarily youth </v>

701
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:57.530
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile and so hopefully what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do during this course is give </v>

702
00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:01.921
<v Speaker 1>you a whole bunch of tools to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and other people with tools </v>

703
00:40:01.921 --> 00:40:05.961
<v Speaker 1>that will really be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things you can use day to day to </v>

704
00:40:05.961 --> 00:40:09.381
<v Speaker 1>understand yourselves and your families </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on and to improve your future </v>

705
00:40:09.381 --> 00:40:11.550
<v Speaker 1>with any luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also cover</v>

706
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.980
<v Speaker 1>the elements of you that are stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of which I would say have been </v>

707
00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.011
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the more objective sense by </v>

708
00:40:22.011 --> 00:40:25.581
<v Speaker 1>biological psychologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mostly animal researches peculiarly </v>

709
00:40:25.581 --> 00:40:26.100
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

710
00:40:26.101 --> 00:40:31.101
<v Speaker 1>so mythological representations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take a trip back through </v>

711
00:40:31.101 --> 00:40:35.181
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to look at our kick and </v>

712
00:40:35.181 --> 00:40:38.180
<v Speaker 1>ancient stories of mankind told by </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of our species to each other,</v>

713
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.540
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to concentrate on stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have lasted.</v>

714
00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:47.810
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how long we have stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the written form or 4,000</v>

715
00:40:48.271 --> 00:40:51.000
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the evidence suggests that those</v>

716
00:40:51.001 --> 00:40:54.690
<v Speaker 1>stories are based on traditions that go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back far,</v>

717
00:40:54.691 --> 00:40:58.320
<v Speaker 1>far beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 50,000</v>

718
00:40:58.321 --> 00:41:03.321
<v Speaker 1>years and maybe way before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll take a look at those and now </v>

719
00:41:03.321 --> 00:41:05.800
<v Speaker 1>it'll give us a foundation that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>use to build on.</v>

720
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:10.820
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to look at shamonic</v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals and descriptions to get some </v>

721
00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.380
<v Speaker 1>sense of the archetype of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

722
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.940
<v Speaker 1>which sort of means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

723
00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:20.120
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you have to undergo when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're changing and what are you likely </v>

724
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.400
<v Speaker 1>to experience when that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I cAn give you a bit of a preview.</v>

725
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:31.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's seldom the case that if you </v>

726
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:35.450
<v Speaker 1>learned something important that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

727
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.090
<v Speaker 1>this happens to people all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I don't know.</v>

728
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you had a recent relationship that</v>
<v Speaker 1>went seriously sour and you know,</v>

729
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:45.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was because you were going out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a jerk or maybe it's because you're</v>

730
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:50.381
<v Speaker 1>just not very sophisticated and no doubt</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out which of </v>

731
00:41:50.381 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 1>those happens to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you're,</v>

732
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:53.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering the relationship,</v>

733
00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:58.930
<v Speaker 1>but generally what happens to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're moving towards something </v>

734
00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:02.711
<v Speaker 1>and the bottom falls out because </v>
<v Speaker 1>something occurs that they didn't </v>

735
00:42:02.751 --> 00:42:05.300
<v Speaker 1>understand and couldn't predict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in their own behavior.</v>

736
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:10.301
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you had an affair while you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your relationship and you didn't </v>

737
00:42:10.301 --> 00:42:13.841
<v Speaker 1>expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>while what happens is that your current </v>

738
00:42:13.841 --> 00:42:17.290
<v Speaker 1>model of yourself and perhaps even if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is demonstrated as </v>

739
00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:18.770
<v Speaker 1>insufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not rattles,</v>

740
00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:23.771
<v Speaker 1>you are badly and then you're rattled up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some good length of time.</v>

741
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Not very motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat depressed,</v>

742
00:42:26.241 --> 00:42:28.580
<v Speaker 1>fairly anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of fell apart.</v>

743
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:32.660
<v Speaker 1>You don't know which way is up and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you're lucky you think about it</v>

744
00:42:32.661 --> 00:42:36.440
<v Speaker 1>and talk about it and put yourself back </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and when you come out the other</v>

745
00:42:36.441 --> 00:42:41.441
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a little smarter and a little </v>

746
00:42:41.441 --> 00:42:41.441
<v Speaker 1>more together than you were to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

747
00:42:41.441 --> 00:42:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're unlucky,</v>

748
00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:46.481
<v Speaker 1>you just stay in the little pit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can stay in the little pit for a </v>

749
00:42:46.481 --> 00:42:51.191
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very long time and that's not so good </v>

750
00:42:51.191 --> 00:42:54.281
<v Speaker 1>and so you know the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation is actually quite </v>

751
00:42:54.281 --> 00:42:57.251
<v Speaker 1>dangerous because it doesn't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be completed in a successful </v>

752
00:42:57.251 --> 00:42:59.880
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does have a pattern.</v>

753
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:04.930
<v Speaker 1>The pattern usually is you think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you're doing and then </v>

754
00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:09.191
<v Speaker 1>something happens to demonstrate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't know what you're </v>

755
00:43:09.191 --> 00:43:12.161
<v Speaker 1>doing and that puts you in a spin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then through careful analysis and </v>

756
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:17.441
<v Speaker 1>support and discussion and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes that we don't really </v>

757
00:43:17.441 --> 00:43:17.441
<v Speaker 1>understand very well.</v>

758
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.500
<v Speaker 1>You come to incorporate the anomalous </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

759
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:25.660
<v Speaker 1>knocked you on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You reconstruct your personality and </v>

760
00:43:25.731 --> 00:43:30.731
<v Speaker 1>your representations of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you move ahead hopefully more than </v>

761
00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:36.110
<v Speaker 1>you were before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's an interesting thing to know,</v>

762
00:43:36.111 --> 00:43:41.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things nature said again was </v>

763
00:43:41.111 --> 00:43:43.421
<v Speaker 1>that you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell the character of a human </v>

764
00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:43.610
<v Speaker 1>being by how much truth there willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerate.</v>

765
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Now that's an interesting phrase because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you generally think of people because </v>

766
00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:53.501
<v Speaker 1>they're optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They generally think of truth as </v>

767
00:43:53.501 --> 00:43:53.501
<v Speaker 1>something positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's better to know the truth.</v>

768
00:43:53.501 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like no if you pulled the wool over</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes as a general rule,</v>

769
00:43:57.261 --> 00:43:59.810
<v Speaker 1>learning the truth is not a pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

770
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:03.320
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't necessarily mean that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not something you should do,</v>

771
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.700
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that the path to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment is blissful.</v>

772
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:11.720
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very smart idea.</v>

773
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite the opposite.</v>

774
00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:19.660
<v Speaker 1>So the shamanic rituals basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest that's in an architectural way.</v>

775
00:44:19.971 --> 00:44:23.230
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you see happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the typicals,</v>

776
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:24.470
<v Speaker 1>the sharman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

777
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:29.471
<v Speaker 1>shamanism is a worldwide phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be associated with a </v>

778
00:44:29.471 --> 00:44:32.820
<v Speaker 1>primordial or archaic psychology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

779
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:37.821
<v Speaker 1>It's often drug aided and generally what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens is that a shamonic </v>

780
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:43.341
<v Speaker 1>transformation is accompanied by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>descent into something approximating </v>

781
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.920
<v Speaker 1>psychological death and then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding and a rebirth that puts the </v>

782
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:53.151
<v Speaker 1>person out on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an initiation ritual and </v>

783
00:44:53.151 --> 00:44:56.960
<v Speaker 1>that's another way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you might think about it as the </v>

784
00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.740
<v Speaker 1>depression that possessed you during </v>
<v Speaker 1>your first semester of university,</v>

785
00:44:59.100 --> 00:44:59.850
<v Speaker 1>which either</v>

786
00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:05.430
<v Speaker 1>knock you out of the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>altogether because that happens to a lot</v>

787
00:45:05.431 --> 00:45:09.150
<v Speaker 1>of people are which you recovered from </v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally became a university student.</v>

788
00:45:09.151 --> 00:45:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Although perhaps that wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly pleasant transition.</v>

789
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:17.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done some testing with u of t </v>

790
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.851
<v Speaker 1>students and it's interesting to note </v>
<v Speaker 1>that about a third of you meet criteria </v>

791
00:45:19.851 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 1>for clinical depression your first year </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

792
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that indicates to me is that the </v>

793
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:26.960
<v Speaker 1>criteria for clinical depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our little on the sensitive side,</v>

794
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:29.130
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but regardless,</v>

795
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:31.260
<v Speaker 1>because if a third of people meet the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criteria,</v>

796
00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:33.060
<v Speaker 1>thank yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a little sensitive,</v>

797
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.040
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:40.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy adjustment and the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>you has to die and generally that's not </v>

799
00:45:41.251 --> 00:45:46.251
<v Speaker 1>very pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and it's a good way to think about </v>

800
00:45:46.251 --> 00:45:50.361
<v Speaker 1>the impediments to learning because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly ever learned something without </v>

801
00:45:50.361 --> 00:45:53.601
<v Speaker 1>having part of you dies first and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that people are </v>

802
00:45:53.601 --> 00:45:54.660
<v Speaker 1>rather resistant to learning anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>

803
00:45:54.661 --> 00:45:56.400
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

804
00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got that.</v>

805
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Now after that we're going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget and piaget isn't necessarily </v>

806
00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:07.101
<v Speaker 1>known as a personality psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

807
00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Psj published a developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>

808
00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:13.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe the greatest developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists.</v>

809
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.270
<v Speaker 1>he published a very large number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

810
00:46:18.271 --> 00:46:20.450
<v Speaker 1>many of which haven't even been </v>
<v Speaker 1>translated yet,</v>

811
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.330
<v Speaker 1>some of which haven't even been </v>
<v Speaker 1>published yet.</v>

812
00:46:22.331 --> 00:46:26.850
<v Speaker 1>So piaget thought a lot of things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things and he's generally known</v>

813
00:46:26.851 --> 00:46:31.851
<v Speaker 1>for his stage theory of development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he really wasn't all that into that </v>

814
00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:35.361
<v Speaker 1>stage theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seemed to be the part of this </v>

815
00:46:35.361 --> 00:46:37.941
<v Speaker 1>theory that I would say rather dimwitted</v>
<v Speaker 1>western intellectuals could grasp onto </v>

816
00:46:38.611 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 1>most easily and so that's generally what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about,</v>

817
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:46.520
<v Speaker 1>but piaget was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sophisticated thinker and one of </v>

818
00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.690
<v Speaker 1>the things he was interested in was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

819
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:52.380
<v Speaker 1>he was interested in how the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense boots itself up.</v>

820
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:57.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a reasonable way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because you know when you turn </v>

821
00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.931
<v Speaker 1>on a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is a certain number of </v>

822
00:46:59.931 --> 00:47:02.811
<v Speaker 1>primitive functions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive fundamental functions come </v>

823
00:47:02.811 --> 00:47:06.261
<v Speaker 1>online first and then those functions </v>
<v Speaker 1>enable more complex functions to emerge </v>

824
00:47:06.571 --> 00:47:11.571
<v Speaker 1>and then those functions may enable more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex functions to emerge and soon </v>

825
00:47:11.571 --> 00:47:15.210
<v Speaker 1>there your computer is waiting for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and human beings are kind of like that.</v>

826
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So when we're first born were very </v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive.</v>

827
00:47:19.591 --> 00:47:22.770
<v Speaker 1>When we're first born were very </v>
<v Speaker 1>immature.</v>

828
00:47:22.771 --> 00:47:23.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a better way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

829
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:28.941
<v Speaker 1>We're not precisely primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still have very large brains and </v>

830
00:47:28.941 --> 00:47:29.160
<v Speaker 1>there are more connections in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>

831
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Birth and there were any that there will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be for the rest of your life,</v>

832
00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:37.320
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually dye into your personality </v>

833
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 1>because what happens isn't so much that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make new connections instead a whole</v>

834
00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:42.820
<v Speaker 1>bunch of the ones you already have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't use disappeared,</v>

835
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:47.500
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty peculiar anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you first born,</v>

836
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:52.060
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot to you in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to engage with the world.</v>

837
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Your mouth is pretty wired up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your lips and your tongue,</v>

838
00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.120
<v Speaker 1>which is a good thing because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to breastfeed and that's actually not </v>

839
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.331
<v Speaker 1>very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a clue to do that and </v>

840
00:48:03.331 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 1>it's the first complex social </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction you're likely to engage in.</v>

841
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:10.110
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're born with a fair bit of a </v>

842
00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:11.740
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sophisticated wiring already in place,</v>

843
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.660
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

844
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:16.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not there much at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't control your arms.</v>

845
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:18.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch a baby in a crib,</v>

846
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.150
<v Speaker 1>a young baby and it's not swaddled up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

847
00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:26.220
<v Speaker 1>their arms sort of float around in space</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so to their legs and now and then </v>

848
00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.761
<v Speaker 1>they might get themselves and generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to come as quite a shock to </v>

849
00:48:29.761 --> 00:48:29.761
<v Speaker 1>the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

850
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It's peripheral nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The peripheral elements of its central </v>

851
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:38.290
<v Speaker 1>nervous system are not well developed at</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth,</v>

852
00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:42.310
<v Speaker 1>and so it's almost as if the baby has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>discover its limbs.</v>

853
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.770
<v Speaker 1>It sort of expands from the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>outwards,</v>

854
00:48:44.771 --> 00:48:49.771
<v Speaker 1>it has to discover its limbs and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to figure out what to do with </v>

855
00:48:49.771 --> 00:48:54.511
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what piaget attempted to do was </v>

856
00:48:54.511 --> 00:48:57.601
<v Speaker 1>to lay out the processes by which a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child unfolded into the world.</v>

857
00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some there's a biological basis to that </v>

858
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:05.971
<v Speaker 1>because you come into the world at birth</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a set of reflexes at hand,</v>

859
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.120
<v Speaker 1>and those reflexes are enough to get you</v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

860
00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one way of trying to understand </v>

861
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 1>piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it quite a bit.</v>

862
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:19.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit of an over simplification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll do.</v>

863
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:25.140
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about what the world is made </v>

864
00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:25.330
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know if you're a classically,</v>

865
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're a classical scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think that the world is made</v>

866
00:49:28.481 --> 00:49:32.080
<v Speaker 1>out of matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matter is made out of atoms,</v>

867
00:49:32.081 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 1>and then atoms are made out of god only </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what atoms are made out of,</v>

868
00:49:35.321 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because by the time you get uNder adams,</v>

869
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:40.180
<v Speaker 1>you just have no idea what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>down there,</v>

870
00:49:40.181 --> 00:49:45.181
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we generally don't think about that too </v>

871
00:49:45.181 --> 00:49:48.031
<v Speaker 1>much and we sort of assume newtonian </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality and that everything is made out </v>

872
00:49:48.031 --> 00:49:50.320
<v Speaker 1>of hard little particles like dust and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the scientific one.</v>

873
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.920
<v Speaker 1>But there's other ways of looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that are not only equally valid </v>

874
00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:59.410
<v Speaker 1>but equally necessary and equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

875
00:49:59.411 --> 00:50:04.411
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is that you could look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the world as a matrix of information </v>

876
00:50:04.411 --> 00:50:09.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so inflammation generally has </v>

877
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:11.821
<v Speaker 1>significance and meaning or at least in </v>
<v Speaker 1>so far as the information is </v>

878
00:50:11.821 --> 00:50:13.450
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized by human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

879
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.020
<v Speaker 1>if you're two years old and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>crawling around on the floor and the dog</v>

880
00:50:17.021 --> 00:50:19.420
<v Speaker 1>has a bone and you grab it and the dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>nips you,</v>

881
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.600
<v Speaker 1>that's informative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what piaget claims is that </v>

882
00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:31.410
<v Speaker 1>children come into the world with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>information seeking structure and that </v>

883
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:36.700
<v Speaker 1>as they interact with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena emerge that they can model </v>

884
00:50:37.281 --> 00:50:39.920
<v Speaker 1>with their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

885
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:46.390
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to drink this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'd have to model it with my hand </v>

886
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 1>before I can do so and so it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

887
00:50:48.471 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't.</v>

888
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:54.070
<v Speaker 1>If this thing sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if I'm thirsty and I look at </v>

889
00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:58.391
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my eyes tell them my hands to get ready </v>

890
00:50:58.391 --> 00:51:01.481
<v Speaker 1>to grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you say you understand </v>

891
00:51:01.481 --> 00:51:04.331
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you mean is that at least part of </v>

892
00:51:04.331 --> 00:51:06.500
<v Speaker 1>what you mean is that when you perceive </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

893
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 1>it maps itself onto your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this happens at pretty low levels</v>

894
00:51:11.211 --> 00:51:12.950
<v Speaker 1>of your nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

895
00:51:12.951 --> 00:51:16.460
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say they're blind,</v>

896
00:51:16.461 --> 00:51:21.461
<v Speaker 1>they can't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you move your hands up like this </v>

897
00:51:21.741 --> 00:51:24.350
<v Speaker 1>and you ask them to guess which hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lifting,</v>

898
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.960
<v Speaker 1>they can do it with almost 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>accuracy.</v>

899
00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.130
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

900
00:51:28.131 --> 00:51:30.560
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can that possibly be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They Were blind.</v>

901
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that happens is because your </v>

902
00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:36.920
<v Speaker 1>eyes are detecting patterns in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

903
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Some of those patterns you perceive as </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious reality,</v>

904
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:47.500
<v Speaker 1>but other patterns you just mapped right</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto your spine or or onto your </v>

905
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:47.540
<v Speaker 1>emotional system doesn't.</v>

906
00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:52.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't need the perception of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>object in order to have that activated </v>

907
00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:53.390
<v Speaker 1>because you know you probably fade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the world,</v>

908
00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:54.530
<v Speaker 1>you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about it,</v>

909
00:51:54.531 --> 00:51:55.980
<v Speaker 1>you evaluate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you act.</v>

910
00:51:55.990 --> 00:52:00.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like that isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very seldomly how it works.</v>

911
00:52:00.081 --> 00:52:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Partly because it's just too damn slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

912
00:52:03.261 --> 00:52:08.261
<v Speaker 1>If you had to think about everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be running over pedestrians </v>

913
00:52:08.261 --> 00:52:08.261
<v Speaker 1>nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

914
00:52:08.261 --> 00:52:12.460
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to react very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly and part of the way you do </v>

915
00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:15.671
<v Speaker 1>that is by having your sensory systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>map right onto your motor output </v>

916
00:52:15.671 --> 00:52:16.850
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

917
00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 1>so piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

918
00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:30.930
<v Speaker 1>for piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the way that the personality </v>

919
00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:33.451
<v Speaker 1>emerges out of the doldrums of infancy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the child encounters the world </v>

920
00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:38.790
<v Speaker 1>and incorporates the information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they gather as a consequence of bumping </v>

921
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:43.681
<v Speaker 1>up against it and then they build </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in some sense from their </v>

922
00:52:43.681 --> 00:52:47.851
<v Speaker 1>bodies and the ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abilities that they're practicing </v>

923
00:52:47.851 --> 00:52:48.160
<v Speaker 1>with their bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the gripping mechanism.</v>

924
00:52:48.161 --> 00:52:53.161
<v Speaker 1>And the pointing mechanism and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratching mechanism and all those </v>

925
00:52:53.161 --> 00:52:55.981
<v Speaker 1>things that they can build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they build those up to the point where </v>

926
00:52:55.981 --> 00:52:59.520
<v Speaker 1>they can start to use abstractions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so the baby sort of spirals out of </v>

927
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.040
<v Speaker 1>nowhere using it's exploratory capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbing information from the world and</v>

928
00:53:03.041 --> 00:53:06.080
<v Speaker 1>creates its personality that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So lovely marlin.</v>

929
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:10.420
<v Speaker 1>We'll cover that in some detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The depths psychologists,</v>

930
00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I concentrate primarily on young and </v>
<v Speaker 1>freud and you know,</v>

931
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:18.400
<v Speaker 1>if you take a personality course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally you'll,</v>

932
00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:23.640
<v Speaker 1>you'll be introduced to freud first and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll be introduced to yoga and </v>

933
00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:26.581
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'd learned some of the neil </v>
<v Speaker 1>friday ends more or less as </v>

934
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:29.521
<v Speaker 1>afterthoughts to freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really think that's </v>

935
00:53:29.521 --> 00:53:29.521
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>

936
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:34.880
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can make a strong case that </v>

937
00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:39.651
<v Speaker 1>you was that the utility of [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory is particularly evident when </v>

938
00:53:43.861 --> 00:53:47.370
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities between people.</v>

939
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 1>So young was very biologically oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways.</v>

940
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:57.740
<v Speaker 1>he was way ahead of biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrists and psychologists because </v>

941
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.790
<v Speaker 1>when young was beginning to formulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>his theories in the west,</v>

942
00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:02.990
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

943
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.370
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in north America anyways,</v>

944
00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:09.480
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the people who were studying </v>

945
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:13.611
<v Speaker 1>human beings were behaviorists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors basically presumed that you </v>

946
00:54:13.611 --> 00:54:16.761
<v Speaker 1>are a blank slate at birth and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned how to do everything that you </v>

947
00:54:16.761 --> 00:54:18.330
<v Speaker 1>know how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

948
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.520
<v Speaker 1>that's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

949
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:26.100
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't learn everything that you know</v>

950
00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:31.101
<v Speaker 1>how to do because you have to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to start the whole process </v>

951
00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:31.101
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

952
00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:35.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to learn really to </v>

953
00:54:35.031 --> 00:54:35.220
<v Speaker 1>understand what a dog's grown means.</v>

954
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:40.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of wired into you and you </v>

955
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.670
<v Speaker 1>already don't have to learn to be afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dark man.</v>

956
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:42.600
<v Speaker 1>You've got that down by the time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were about three,</v>

957
00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:44.970
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's lots of things that are built</v>

958
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:47.280
<v Speaker 1>right into people and what exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

959
00:54:47.281 --> 00:54:48.660
<v Speaker 1>we're not sure about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it does.</v>

960
00:54:48.661 --> 00:54:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

961
00:54:49.471 --> 00:54:52.050
<v Speaker 1>like snake phobia is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is innate.</v>

962
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:55.080
<v Speaker 1>And even if the actual phobia isn't an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

963
00:54:55.081 --> 00:55:00.081
<v Speaker 1>and it probably is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can learn to be phobic of snakes in </v>

964
00:55:00.081 --> 00:55:02.961
<v Speaker 1>no time flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas like trying to become phobic of </v>

965
00:55:02.961 --> 00:55:02.961
<v Speaker 1>pistols is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>

966
00:55:02.961 --> 00:55:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young was very interested in the,</v>

967
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I think what the best way to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the substrata of human cognition.</v>

968
00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:15.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because human beings are a particular </v>

969
00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:15.730
<v Speaker 1>type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like our,</v>

970
00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:19.640
<v Speaker 1>our souls are disconnected from our </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies and that our knowledge is somehow</v>

971
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:27.830
<v Speaker 1>appropriate or universal in some way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make sense if we didn't have </v>

972
00:55:27.961 --> 00:55:28.560
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>

973
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 1>We're not down at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in our bodies.</v>

974
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Our brains are adapted to our bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our minds are adapted to our bodies and </v>

975
00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.841
<v Speaker 1>so as our knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that our cognitive </v>

976
00:55:41.841 --> 00:55:45.570
<v Speaker 1>abilities are theories of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have biological substructures,</v>

977
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:50.870
<v Speaker 1>and those are preset positions in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense for our knowledge that we don't </v>

978
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:52.380
<v Speaker 1>have to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

979
00:55:52.381 --> 00:55:54.570
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have to learn that </v>
<v Speaker 1>being punched hers.</v>

980
00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.800
<v Speaker 1>You just discover that you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to learn what a smile means.</v>

981
00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have to learn what </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger means.</v>

982
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:04.230
<v Speaker 1>You'll experience it so it's right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

983
00:56:04.231 --> 00:56:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It's you like little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little babies.</v>

984
00:56:06.301 --> 00:56:08.550
<v Speaker 1>When they're crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often angry.</v>

985
00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.620
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by nine months of age,</v>

986
00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 1>a baby can more or less identified its </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

987
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:20.750
<v Speaker 1>So someone walks into the baby's room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and takes a look at the baby and it's </v>

988
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.680
<v Speaker 1>not the baby's mother and the baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts crying and you think,</v>

989
00:56:22.681 --> 00:56:23.500
<v Speaker 1>oh baby.</v>

990
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

991
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:29.490
<v Speaker 1>That baby is not sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That baby is angry and you can tell if </v>

992
00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 1>you look at the baby because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning all red.</v>

993
00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's what people do when they cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're angry.</v>

994
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a good thing to know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're arguing with someone and they get</v>

995
00:56:37.121 --> 00:56:38.830
<v Speaker 1>upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they start to cry.</v>

996
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

997
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.160
<v Speaker 1>the poor person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then if you look,</v>

998
00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that they're all red and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means they'd like to strangle you,</v>

999
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:46.390
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1000
00:56:46.391 --> 00:56:49.120
<v Speaker 1>they're social niceties is hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>preventing them.</v>

1001
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:54.510
<v Speaker 1>So that can certainly change your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude towards whether or not you </v>

1002
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:54.610
<v Speaker 1>should be feeling sorry for them when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you hurt their feelings.</v>

1003
00:56:55.030 --> 00:57:00.030
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's all sorts of things that are </v>

1004
00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:01.210
<v Speaker 1>universal about human beings and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga was very,</v>

1005
00:57:01.211 --> 00:57:06.211
<v Speaker 1>very interested in what those universals</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and how they played out in patterns </v>

1006
00:57:06.211 --> 00:57:06.211
<v Speaker 1>of behavior.</v>

1007
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:12.270
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that you have an </v>

1008
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:14.851
<v Speaker 1>instinct say like anger and thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that way.</v>

1009
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 1>He's like a cross section that person's </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>

1010
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:22.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can imagine a facial </v>

1011
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:22.500
<v Speaker 1>configuration that would go along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1012
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.710
<v Speaker 1>but in a more sophisticated way if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want it to represent anger,</v>

1013
00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:27.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe you've represented like a drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a story you know began.</v>

1014
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:30.160
<v Speaker 1>that's actually what you want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone gets angry,</v>

1015
00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:33.580
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1016
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:39.340
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you took a thousand stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>about angry people and you blow them all</v>

1017
00:57:39.341 --> 00:57:44.341
<v Speaker 1>into one story so that everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was common about all the stories about </v>

1018
00:57:44.341 --> 00:57:46.660
<v Speaker 1>anger were encapsulated in a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1019
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be the archetypal story </v>
<v Speaker 1>of anger and everyone would recognize it</v>

1020
00:57:51.611 --> 00:57:56.611
<v Speaker 1>because it's like anger represented like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie in some sense in its purest </v>

1021
00:57:56.611 --> 00:57:56.720
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1022
00:57:56.721 --> 00:58:01.721
<v Speaker 1>that's an archetype and that's the sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing that was extraordinarily </v>

1023
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:02.260
<v Speaker 1>interested in understanding a document.</v>

1024
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:07.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's a tremendous amount of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we'll do is I'm </v>

1025
00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:08.230
<v Speaker 1>going to show you some movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the lion king,</v>

1026
00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:13.231
<v Speaker 1>at least parts of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to show you how the </v>

1027
00:58:13.231 --> 00:58:14.650
<v Speaker 1>archetypal structure manifests itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really worth knowing.</v>

1028
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.620
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a pain because then from </v>
<v Speaker 1>now on you go to movies and you think,</v>

1029
00:58:17.621 --> 00:58:22.621
<v Speaker 1>oh well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that archetipal structured and </v>

1030
00:58:22.621 --> 00:58:23.410
<v Speaker 1>that's what that symbol means and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>really be annoying to your friends.</v>

1031
00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:27.280
<v Speaker 1>But it's very entertaining and it's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>illuminating.</v>

1032
00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And partly because what's really cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>about these archetypal story structures </v>

1033
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.360
<v Speaker 1>is that not only they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you who you are,</v>

1034
00:58:34.361 --> 00:58:36.760
<v Speaker 1>but they tell you in some sense who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be.</v>

1035
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Now that's cool because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that modern people have a real </v>

1036
00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:44.110
<v Speaker 1>problem with is trying to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not life has any meaning.</v>

1037
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:49.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look at the world from a scientific </v>

1038
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:49.480
<v Speaker 1>perspective and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1039
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 1>it appears that all of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1040
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:55.230
<v Speaker 1>without meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean anything in any cosmic </v>

1041
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.230
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1042
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:58.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty dopey conclusion as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned because the originators of</v>

1043
00:58:59.111 --> 00:59:04.111
<v Speaker 1>the scientific method excluded </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective meaning from the doctrine at </v>

1044
00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:06.360
<v Speaker 1>the outset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1045
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.350
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the world scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you saying,</v>

1046
00:59:08.351 --> 00:59:09.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's without subjective meaning.</v>

1047
00:59:09.881 --> 00:59:10.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1048
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:15.331
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously because science was set up so </v>

1049
00:59:15.331 --> 00:59:16.630
<v Speaker 1>that all the subjective meaning would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripped away from the phenomena.</v>

1050
00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:21.930
<v Speaker 1>So you knoW,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not something to be really shocked </v>

1051
00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:21.930
<v Speaker 1>about afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also doesn't mean that there's no</v>

1052
00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:26.651
<v Speaker 1>such thing as subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning it just means that it's very </v>

1053
00:59:26.651 --> 00:59:28.040
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get a grip on it from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>purely scientific perspective.</v>

1054
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And one of the lovely things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural stories is they tell you </v>

1055
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.600
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's universally believable </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are and,</v>

1056
00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:43.810
<v Speaker 1>and that's very cool and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think you can learn this in </v>

1057
00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:44.300
<v Speaker 1>university too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just tears me up.</v>

1058
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:49.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn implicitly or explicitly and </v>

1059
00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 1>almost all of the fields of study that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to undertake,</v>

1060
00:59:50.991 --> 00:59:55.991
<v Speaker 1>especially on the humanities and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral morality is relative and that </v>

1061
00:59:55.991 --> 01:00:00.491
<v Speaker 1>there's no ultimate meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really rotten thing to be </v>

1062
01:00:00.491 --> 01:00:03.971
<v Speaker 1>teaching people of your age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't because you're too damn young </v>

1063
01:00:03.971 --> 01:00:08.111
<v Speaker 1>to be nIhilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you can meet our listing when </v>

1064
01:00:08.111 --> 01:00:08.111
<v Speaker 1>you're 85,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1065
01:00:08.111 --> 01:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you're all done by then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be nihilistic now that's a bloody</v>

1066
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1067
01:00:11.371 --> 01:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>when it's completely pointless because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of the notion that things are</v>

1068
01:00:16.101 --> 01:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>meaningless in some ultimate sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1069
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:25.510
<v Speaker 1>it's an extraordinarily primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical theory and it does not </v>

1070
01:00:25.611 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>serve people well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes them sick.</v>

1071
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:33.940
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider that is that if you're stupid </v>

1072
01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 1>theory makes you sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something wrong with it.</v>

1073
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:40.750
<v Speaker 1>It might be a criteria for the utility </v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps even the truth of the theory,</v>

1074
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends how you think about these </v>

1075
01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1076
01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

1077
01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:48.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a truth makes you sick,</v>

1078
01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean it's any less than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

1079
01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

1080
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe it really does mean that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

1081
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:58.510
<v Speaker 1>much less of a truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends to some degree on what you </v>

1082
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>mean by truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1083
01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.320
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1084
01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very useful for that.</v>

1085
01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:07.300
<v Speaker 1>He's at terrifying thinker really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I read when I was about 23 or 24,</v>

1086
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I spent two years in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read preTty much everything.</v>

1087
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>You wrote about 23 volumes and it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>blew me into bits.</v>

1088
01:01:16.551 --> 01:01:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea what the hell was going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my dreams changed.</v>

1089
01:01:19.671 --> 01:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>And really it was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really rough.</v>

1090
01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I was reading nietzsche at the same time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's just about as bad,</v>

1091
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:28.520
<v Speaker 1>like nature setting philosophize with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer,</v>

1092
01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's great unless he's taking a </v>

1093
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>hammer to your skull and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly so pleasant.</v>

1094
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

1095
01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:39.701
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a completely different sort of </v>

1096
01:01:39.701 --> 01:01:41.891
<v Speaker 1>creature and I think that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason you never really learned about </v>

1097
01:01:41.891 --> 01:01:41.891
<v Speaker 1>them in the university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1098
01:01:41.891 --> 01:01:46.480
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it looks weird and if you do </v>

1099
01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.641
<v Speaker 1>understand them a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's terrifying and you're bloody well </v>

1100
01:01:48.641 --> 01:01:48.641
<v Speaker 1>going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll think,</v>

1101
01:01:48.641 --> 01:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

1102
01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't really need to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So freud,</v>

1103
01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>freud tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice whipping boy for psychologists,</v>

1104
01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>which I also think is pretty pathetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's in great,</v>

1105
01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>ungrateful to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1106
01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:07.160
<v Speaker 1>freud was really the person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>formalize the idea of done unconscious,</v>

1107
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now everyone takes that for granted that</v>

1108
01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:14.831
<v Speaker 1>there's the cognitive unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the psychologist discovered </v>

1109
01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:15.890
<v Speaker 1>in what the 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a cognitive unconscious.</v>

1110
01:02:15.891 --> 01:02:16.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1111
01:02:16.641 --> 01:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>good work guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd figured that out back in 1910,</v>

1112
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see the credit being given</v>

1113
01:02:23.131 --> 01:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>to freud for making that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>

1114
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>If you look at experimental psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think,</v>

1115
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really ungrateful for </v>

1116
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take issue with especially the </v>

1117
01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>details of his theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1118
01:02:37.301 --> 01:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>like the eatable complex for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or penis envy,</v>

1119
01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1120
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:47.710
<v Speaker 1>nO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways they seem laughably </v>

1121
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:48.360
<v Speaker 1>anachronistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1122
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:54.740
<v Speaker 1>sometimes someone can be wrong in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>details and right in the overall </v>

1123
01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>conception because theories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>multilayered things,</v>

1124
01:02:56.461 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes I read a student essay,</v>

1125
01:02:58.651 --> 01:03:01.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sentences are just awful.</v>

1126
01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.920
<v Speaker 1>This person like our god only knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they learned to write probably in </v>

1127
01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.350
<v Speaker 1>a high school somewhere and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incomprehensible.</v>

1128
01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.300
<v Speaker 1>But if you read the whole thing and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1129
01:03:12.301 --> 01:03:13.740
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an idea in here,</v>

1130
01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person is smarter than their ability</v>

1131
01:03:15.961 --> 01:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>to write and so then you can write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

1132
01:03:18.271 --> 01:03:19.800
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't write worth a damn,</v>

1133
01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:24.801
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty smart and you've got some </v>

1134
01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:27.591
<v Speaker 1>ideas here that if you could articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a really high quality so you </v>

1135
01:03:27.591 --> 01:03:29.430
<v Speaker 1>can be wrong in the details and right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overall picture.</v>

1136
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:34.430
<v Speaker 1>And freud was like that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And freud was also unbeatable in </v>

1137
01:03:37.721 --> 01:03:42.721
<v Speaker 1>relationship to familial pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from [inaudible] perspective,</v>

1138
01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:53.210
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental task of the emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being was to extricate themselves </v>

1139
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:55.590
<v Speaker 1>from their family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>

1140
01:03:55.591 --> 01:03:57.360
<v Speaker 1>well why is that such a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1141
01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.470
<v Speaker 1>here's a couple of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

1142
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:05.490
<v Speaker 1>your parents take care of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like maybe you don't want to </v>

1143
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 1>dispense with that too early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they really,</v>

1144
01:04:05.761 --> 01:04:10.761
<v Speaker 1>really take care of you and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole situation from the freudian </v>

1145
01:04:10.761 --> 01:04:15.060
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the atypical situation arises </v>

1146
01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:18.141
<v Speaker 1>when you have a parent or two parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>who do so much for you that you're no </v>

1147
01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:23.100
<v Speaker 1>longer able to do anything for yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is not a good situation.</v>

1148
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.280
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily pathological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is nobody like freud who lays out </v>

1149
01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:32.250
<v Speaker 1>the detaIls of that pathology and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna watch a movie from it's called,</v>

1150
01:04:32.251 --> 01:04:36.000
<v Speaker 1>which is very disturbing movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I suppose is a trigger warning for</v>

1151
01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>those of you who think you need trigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>warnings.</v>

1152
01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

1153
01:04:39.361 --> 01:04:44.361
<v Speaker 1>very distressing documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will show you freddy and </v>

1154
01:04:44.361 --> 01:04:47.511
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've never seen it unless you happen </v>

1155
01:04:47.511 --> 01:04:48.560
<v Speaker 1>to live in a thoroughly eat whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

1156
01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:50.070
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>

1157
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get through the whole outline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you very briefly what you're </v>

1158
01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.950
<v Speaker 1>going to be required to do and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll continue this in the next lecture.</v>

1159
01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:03.000
<v Speaker 1>So just three exams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two midterms and a final.</v>

1160
01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:05.280
<v Speaker 1>There are multiple choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1161
01:05:05.281 --> 01:05:10.281
<v Speaker 1>I'll post some of the questions before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the exam so that you know what you're </v>

1162
01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:13.341
<v Speaker 1>getting into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're particularly </v>

1163
01:05:13.341 --> 01:05:13.341
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you will beg to differ.</v>

1164
01:05:13.341 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's pressure on us this year to </v>

1165
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>curve the grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so beware.</v>

1166
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>I may have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1167
01:05:18.431 --> 01:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Just in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know that,</v>

1168
01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:21.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to write an essay,</v>

1169
01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:25.030
<v Speaker 1>750 words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a very long essay,</v>

1170
01:05:25.031 --> 01:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>but that makes it actually more </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

1171
01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:31.860
<v Speaker 1>The signup for the topics for the essay </v>
<v Speaker 1>or on the website or you can just go </v>

1172
01:05:32.111 --> 01:05:37.111
<v Speaker 1>there and sign up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 20 different topics and there's </v>

1173
01:05:37.111 --> 01:05:40.351
<v Speaker 1>15 slots for each topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would recommend that you do that </v>

1174
01:05:40.351 --> 01:05:43.351
<v Speaker 1>quite quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do a personality self </v>

1175
01:05:43.351 --> 01:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven point five percent of your grade.</v>

1176
01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.430
<v Speaker 1>The link to that is online too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get started on that whenever you</v>

1177
01:05:48.431 --> 01:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's over there in the corner of </v>

1180
01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.320
<v Speaker 1>patiently waiting for me to introduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

1181
01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:03.250
