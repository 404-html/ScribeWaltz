1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.790
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so today we're going to talk about,</v>

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.230
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>openness.</v>

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you might say in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness is the last discovered that the</v>

5
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:20.581
<v Speaker 1>big five traits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also the one I would say that </v>

6
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>comes up most weekly in the factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

7
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.550
<v Speaker 1>When Hans ising formulated his trait </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

8
00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>which was extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism and psychotic system.</v>

9
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.750
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I felt that he encapsulated all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental variation in human </v>

11
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>personality and nick and he was loathed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to include intelligence as a personality</v>

12
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

13
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ISM and openness is rather complex.</v>

14
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Isaac basically felt that people could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be extroverted and that would be the </v>

15
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>positive dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>

16
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high in negative emotion.</v>

17
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:05.931
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the negative emotion dimension</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they also could have a </v>

18
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>predisposition to psychosis and I guess </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be.</v>

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>He was thinking about the brain systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that underlie schizophrenia and that </v>

20
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>that tendency to dissociate and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and develop hallucinations,</v>

21
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:24.081
<v Speaker 1>but also maybe the system in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings that are affected by </v>

22
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:29.601
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seemed to affect human beings </v>

23
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>differently than they have their other </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures.</v>

24
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Isaac psychotic eventually was </v>

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>broken down into low agreeableness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>low conscientiousness.</v>

26
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:44.121
<v Speaker 1>It didn't predict the predisposition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosis at all and later factor </v>

27
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:49.311
<v Speaker 1>analysis found that you could load out </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and creativity as a </v>

28
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 1>personality dimension separately.</v>

29
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a bit tricky because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq measures and Iq measures are much </v>

30
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>more direct measures of intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the personality measures.</v>

31
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean the personality measure is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

32
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>do you think you're smart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

33
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:12.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm being a bit flip about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's more sophisticated than </v>

34
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:17.511
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you talk about someone as a </v>

35
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:19.671
<v Speaker 1>smart person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're generally referring to the trait </v>

36
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:22.851
<v Speaker 1>that we would describe as openness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also are doing that when you refer </v>

37
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>to the to creativity as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a previous position,</v>

38
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 1>and you could measure the smart part a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot better with ICU and ICU is also a </v>

39
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:36.561
<v Speaker 1>pretty good predictor of creativity so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

40
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:41.721
<v Speaker 1>So let's see how they're associated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he remembered that you have your big </v>

41
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.230
<v Speaker 1>two traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stability of plasticity and stability </v>

42
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>breaks down into conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability and agreeableness,</v>

43
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>and then you can see how each of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects are correlated.</v>

44
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.640
<v Speaker 1>How highly they're correlated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so industriousness and orderliness at </v>

45
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.031
<v Speaker 1>about point for volatility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal and emotional stability or </v>

46
00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:06.211
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually about point six and </v>

47
00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness and politeness at about </v>
<v Speaker 1>point four,</v>

48
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.620
<v Speaker 1>and then the next trait is extroversion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and openness that makes plasticity and </v>

49
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>people who were high in plasticity tend </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be good entrepreneurs by the way,</v>

50
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.100
<v Speaker 1>and extroversion rates into </v>
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness and enthusiasm correlated </v>

51
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>at about point five and then openness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and intelligence.</v>

52
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>And the correlation there is lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's point three,</v>

53
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:38.281
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average correlation between the big </v>

54
00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>five is point two and the correlation </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the big two is about point two.</v>

55
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might ask yourself,</v>

56
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:48.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a correlation of point for twice as </v>

57
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>large as a correlation of point to </v>
<v Speaker 1>announce to that is no,</v>

58
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.190
<v Speaker 1>because you have to square them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare them arithmetically.</v>

59
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>So a correlation of point to point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

60
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four percent squared,</v>

61
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>And a correlation port for gives you 16 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent squared.</v>

63
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>So there's actually a difference of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor of four.</v>

64
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.630
<v Speaker 1>And so you need to remember that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're considering effect sizes so that </v>

65
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>you can understand exactly what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

66
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:20.161
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're accounting for 16 percent of </v>

67
00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:23.161
<v Speaker 1>the variance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be a correlation of point </v>

68
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:25.321
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that leaves 84 percent left </v>

69
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:28.351
<v Speaker 1>unexplained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a bit of an overstatement </v>

70
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:32.730
<v Speaker 1>most of the time in psychology because </v>
<v Speaker 1>our measures are are rather imperfect.</v>

71
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.430
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give someone a personality test </v>

72
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>and let's say that the validity of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>self report is about point six,</v>

73
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>three point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably what it is,</v>

74
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe it might be a little bit higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

75
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that they're self reporting </v>

76
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>is only picking up 50 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation in their personality.</v>

77
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>And if you pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your are,</v>

79
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.220
<v Speaker 1>if an are derived from that measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts for 16 percent of the variance </v>

80
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.421
<v Speaker 1>in some sense it's twice as powerful as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it appears to be because the measure is </v>

81
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:13.231
<v Speaker 1>so error ridden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the things that we measure </v>

82
00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:16.411
<v Speaker 1>in psychology are error written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that the </v>

83
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>correlations are generally what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

84
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>although not in variable isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlations are bigger than they look.</v>

85
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.530
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the correlations that come up in </v>

86
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>personality research are certainly big </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to be meaningful.</v>

87
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.240
<v Speaker 1>And I would say meaningful in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicting major life outcomes and </v>

88
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>predicting important economic outcomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of thing.</v>

89
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

90
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:42.391
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things you might ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is exactly what does </v>

91
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:48.080
<v Speaker 1>intelligence measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll start with intelligence from,</v>

92
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>from the and that would be equivalent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect,</v>

93
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>ruffin speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So intellect in the big five,</v>

94
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>the aspect seems to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in ideas.</v>

95
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the openness proper aspect seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be associated with aesthetic </v>

96
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:08.951
<v Speaker 1>sensibility and creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way to think about as </v>

97
00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:13.720
<v Speaker 1>far as we've been able to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the biggest relationship is between </v>

98
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 1>into intellect and intelligence as </v>
<v Speaker 1>measured psychometrically.</v>

99
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Now intelligence is an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>

100
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>It's very controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

101
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

102
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.660
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that continually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens over and over again in </v>

103
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.331
<v Speaker 1>psychology is that psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>discover all sorts of new kinds of </v>

104
00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

105
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>the biggest two proponents of that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing,</v>

106
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:42.581
<v Speaker 1>I suppose we're Bob Sternberg who came </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with this thing he called practical </v>

107
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:46.031
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and then Howard Gardner who</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with the theory of multiple </v>

108
00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 1>intelligences which had a very large </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on educational psychology,</v>

109
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the theory was first proposed.</v>

110
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's not saying much because </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

111
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:59.471
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to find a discipline</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more susceptible to fads and </v>

112
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>educational psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>

113
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each fat is worse than the previous one.</v>

114
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 1>So no gardener positive that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>there were seven.</v>

115
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they are,</v>

116
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 1>seven or eight different intelligences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic,</v>

117
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.210
<v Speaker 1>musical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>

118
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 1>mathematical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spacial body,</v>

119
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 1>kinesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal and interpersonal.</v>

120
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.330
<v Speaker 1>And people talk about emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and they talk about </v>

121
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.330
<v Speaker 1>practical intelligence.</v>

122
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that's complete rubbish.</v>

123
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.310
<v Speaker 1>And there's technical reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's technical and </v>

124
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.271
<v Speaker 1>philosophical reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is you can't just mess </v>

125
00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:44.411
<v Speaker 1>up a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole point of having a </v>

126
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:47.201
<v Speaker 1>word is so that it defined some things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that described some things and doesn't </v>

127
00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 1>describe other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

128
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.540
<v Speaker 1>and so you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make the word intelligence </v>

129
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.950
<v Speaker 1>account for whatever you want so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that the ability to dance as a form </v>

130
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.661
<v Speaker 1>of intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with that is you blur </v>

131
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>out the word so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell what it means anymore,</v>

132
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:09.010
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would also point out we had </v>

133
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.961
<v Speaker 1>perfectly good words for those major </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence as we called them talents </v>

134
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:15.610
<v Speaker 1>and so it's perfectly reasonable to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a distinction between the talent and </v>

135
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

136
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:18.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you know the difference?</v>

137
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Like if if things look similar to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

138
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.650
<v Speaker 1>then how do you know if they're the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>or different?</v>

139
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:29.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you do when you do </v>

140
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:31.541
<v Speaker 1>the construct validity process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you rated a number of </v>

141
00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:36.221
<v Speaker 1>people on their dancing ability and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rated a number of people on their </v>

142
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:40.481
<v Speaker 1>ability to multiply two digit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two digit numbers in their head quickly </v>

143
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.240
<v Speaker 1>while then you see technically if both </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those were intelligences than the </v>

144
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:51.791
<v Speaker 1>people who could dance better could </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiply two digit numbers faster in </v>

145
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:55.481
<v Speaker 1>their head and they would be slightly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

146
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>See that's what happens when I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any diet coke.</v>

147
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.290
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if intelligence was the right word to </v>

148
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.221
<v Speaker 1>subsume both of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you see is that would be a </v>

149
00:09:13.221 --> 00:09:17.361
<v Speaker 1>high correlation with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>good dancers would also be the ones who </v>

150
00:09:17.361 --> 00:09:20.541
<v Speaker 1>could multiply most rapidly and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiply in their head but that.</v>

151
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>But you're not going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract out a single factor like that.</v>

152
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the case that those things</v>

153
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:36.021
<v Speaker 1>associate like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for something to be one phenomena,</v>

154
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.610
<v Speaker 1>the things that it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

155
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 1>obviously I've talked too much this </v>
<v Speaker 1>semester.</v>

156
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.460
<v Speaker 1>All the things that are subsumed under </v>
<v Speaker 1>that definition have to be correlated </v>

157
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>and highly correlated because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the same thing.</v>

158
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the definition of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

159
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Iq is a very peculiar construct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very unique construct from a </v>

160
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:15.141
<v Speaker 1>psychological perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also more generally from a social </v>

161
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:18.891
<v Speaker 1>science perspective because Iq has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most predictive validity of anything </v>

162
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:22.440
<v Speaker 1>ever discovered in the social sciences </v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

163
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Now another thing that is interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Iq is that a lot of the people who</v>

164
00:10:30.391 --> 00:10:35.391
<v Speaker 1>were interested early in the measurement</v>
<v Speaker 1>of intelligence were engineers,</v>

165
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:40.521
<v Speaker 1>turned psychologists and the engineers </v>
<v Speaker 1>have actually had quite a whopping </v>

166
00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:44.811
<v Speaker 1>effect on psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason that psychology has </v>

167
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 1>an advanced methodology and advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical techniques is because we got</v>

168
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:51.120
<v Speaker 1>invaded by engineers in the early part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century,</v>

169
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:56.150
<v Speaker 1>and so the engineer has made our </v>
<v Speaker 1>measurements much more rigorous than </v>

170
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.150
<v Speaker 1>they would have otherwise been.</v>

171
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's been a huge advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

172
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.380
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's happening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology is it starting to eat other </v>

173
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.011
<v Speaker 1>disciplines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's had a massive effect on </v>

174
00:11:07.011 --> 00:11:08.100
<v Speaker 1>economics and it's going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive effect on political science.</v>

175
00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:13.101
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to measure things and it </v>

176
00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:13.770
<v Speaker 1>actually turns out to matter that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to measure things.</v>

177
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're going to be talking </v>

178
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.190
<v Speaker 1>about something that's specific and well</v>
<v Speaker 1>defined,</v>

179
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.800
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't make it specific and </v>

180
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.900
<v Speaker 1>well-defined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you can really do is argue about it </v>

181
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.900
<v Speaker 1>and you know there are better and worse </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>

182
00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:35.901
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that just because of an argument is </v>

183
00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:35.901
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean it's right.</v>

184
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also something to remember when </v>

185
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.521
<v Speaker 1>you're arguing about people that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a relationship with because you </v>

186
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:46.951
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to be better at </v>

187
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:46.951
<v Speaker 1>structuring your arguments and your more</v>
<v Speaker 1>verbally fluent man,</v>

188
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:48.300
<v Speaker 1>perhaps more assertive and maybe less </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeable,</v>

189
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.440
<v Speaker 1>you're going to win the arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you're right.</v>

190
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.770
<v Speaker 1>It's unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple.</v>

191
00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.400
<v Speaker 1>And so as far as I can tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empirical process is the only way of </v>

192
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.391
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of the is restricting or </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminating the catastrophic,</v>

193
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:07.580
<v Speaker 1>the detrimental effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure theory</v>

194
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.380
<v Speaker 2>now and</v>

195
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:16.250
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our measurement techniques had been </v>

196
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:16.250
<v Speaker 1>pretty good about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

197
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 1>So now what happens with ICU here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can define Iq for you,</v>

198
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:23.300
<v Speaker 1>just so you know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you had a library of </v>

199
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.010
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's some questions.</v>

200
00:12:29.011 --> 00:12:32.730
<v Speaker 1>So there's millions of questions in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>data bank.</v>

201
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.020
<v Speaker 1>What's two times 68?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the capital of Georgia?</v>

202
00:12:37.021 --> 00:12:39.450
<v Speaker 1>What's the definition of hypertrichosis </v>
<v Speaker 1>anemia?</v>

203
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.720
<v Speaker 1>What comes after in this sequence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>

204
00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:43.470
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

205
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.280
<v Speaker 1>16.</v>

206
00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Remember these numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd tell you the numbers and then </v>

207
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to tell me that back to four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

208
00:12:52.921 --> 00:12:53.580
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

209
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:56.330
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six slash 12 slash 15 slash 14.</v>

210
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.270
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

211
00:12:57.271 --> 00:13:02.271
<v Speaker 1>22.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I might ask you in fact to </v>

212
00:13:02.271 --> 00:13:03.150
<v Speaker 1>remember them backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a working memory task.</v>

213
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

214
00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:09.411
<v Speaker 1>So those are all questions that require.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They require abstraction and mental </v>

215
00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:09.630
<v Speaker 1>operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

216
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.660
<v Speaker 1>that's the key as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

217
00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:15.540
<v Speaker 1>well exactly what constitutes an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>

218
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.140
<v Speaker 1>And it looks to me like what an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction is.</v>

219
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.880
<v Speaker 1>There's the capacity to formulate it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>

220
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.200
<v Speaker 1>There's the capacity to manipulate them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to formulate an abstraction.</v>

221
00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:30.201
<v Speaker 1>I think what you do is you take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena and you represent it with </v>

222
00:13:30.201 --> 00:13:34.191
<v Speaker 1>something that's low resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more or less what an abstraction </v>

223
00:13:34.191 --> 00:13:34.191
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

224
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.870
<v Speaker 1>if I imagined this classroom later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

225
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.330
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my imagine grip presentation is going to</v>

226
00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:45.660
<v Speaker 1>be a much lower resolution than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual classroom,</v>

227
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's sufficient for certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>

228
00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:53.010
<v Speaker 1>just like a thumbnail on a computer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient for certain purposes.</v>

229
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.280
<v Speaker 1>And then once I simplified the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

230
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 1>the phenomena in question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can also perform certain </v>

231
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.820
<v Speaker 1>operations on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in imagination or semantically,</v>

232
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.640
<v Speaker 1>and the capacity to generate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction and the Trans Admin,</v>

233
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:14.970
<v Speaker 1>the ability to manipulate those seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the core element of intelligence.</v>

234
00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:18.030
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

235
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.510
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking as a human dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you know,</v>

236
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.190
<v Speaker 1>obviously you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

237
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:28.850
<v Speaker 1>you can to some degree rank order </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals in terms of their capacity to </v>

238
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.931
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's this whopping </v>

239
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:34.460
<v Speaker 1>differentiation between human beings and</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals in this area particularly is </v>

240
00:14:34.681 --> 00:14:36.960
<v Speaker 1>because we can use abstractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

241
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I heard a woman named Temple grandin </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak once and it was very interesting </v>

242
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.930
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's very autistic and uh,</v>

243
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.280
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

244
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.460
<v Speaker 1>very brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not very common for people who </v>

245
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.491
<v Speaker 1>are autistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's associated with a </v>

246
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:55.491
<v Speaker 1>substantial amount of intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>impairment,</v>

247
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:59.621
<v Speaker 1>but she also had an extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>devoted parent who spent almost all of </v>

248
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 1>her time trying to pull her daughter out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her autistic isolation.</v>

249
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Now grandon has gone on to become the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Chicago professor and she </v>

250
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 1>works in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the agricultural area,</v>

251
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:16.170
<v Speaker 1>and she has redesigned the miss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoots,</v>

252
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:21.230
<v Speaker 1>the walkways basically that take cattle </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the slaughterhouse and she's done </v>

253
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.260
<v Speaker 1>that to make them less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less stressful for the animals.</v>

254
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:29.261
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that she can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as far as she's concerned is </v>

255
00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:31.931
<v Speaker 1>because she thinks like an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means as far as she can </v>

256
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 1>tell is that she cannot generate an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>

257
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Not Easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now she can speak.</v>

258
00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:38.690
<v Speaker 1>So obviously she learned to do it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>

259
00:15:38.691 --> 00:15:43.691
<v Speaker 1>but she talked more about inner talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more about deficits in imagination or </v>

260
00:15:43.691 --> 00:15:47.651
<v Speaker 1>concretization of imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the weird things that you see </v>

261
00:15:47.651 --> 00:15:48.980
<v Speaker 1>with autistic kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not frequently,</v>

262
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:53.981
<v Speaker 1>but now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's actually a famous </v>

263
00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:53.981
<v Speaker 1>example of this on the web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy,</v>

264
00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I think he's from Britain and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take them in a helicopter and fly over a</v>

265
00:15:56.871 --> 00:16:01.700
<v Speaker 1>city and then he can stand in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of paper like 12 by eight,</v>

266
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 1>start anywhere and draw the entire city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

267
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:10.270
<v Speaker 1>and now and then you see autistic savant</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were children who can draw perfectly</v>

268
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:11.720
<v Speaker 1>realistically.</v>

269
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.410
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe they'll draw a horse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even start the horse.</v>

270
00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Like a kid would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a normal kid would,</v>

271
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 1>would sketch the outline of the horse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and put some eyes in,</v>

272
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start anywhere and make the horse </v>

273
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 1>perfectly detailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he claimed was that.</v>

274
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 1>So she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

275
00:16:30.171 --> 00:16:34.010
<v Speaker 1>you think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of house or think of church.</v>

276
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.640
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what comes to mind if you think of </v>

277
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:39.640
<v Speaker 1>church?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe she'd say,</v>

278
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.061
<v Speaker 1>well you get this little image of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that sort of shaped like this </v>

279
00:16:43.061 --> 00:16:45.150
<v Speaker 1>with a steeple on top or a cross or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

280
00:16:45.151 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's the church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you think of house and it's</v>

281
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:49.530
<v Speaker 1>like little kids house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's going to.</v>

282
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.960
<v Speaker 1>It's got a rectangle and a parallel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Graham that's not a Parallelogram,</v>

283
00:16:53.961 --> 00:16:58.961
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell you called up things </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the top and then it's got a chimney </v>

284
00:16:58.961 --> 00:16:58.961
<v Speaker 1>with smoke coming out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

285
00:16:58.961 --> 00:17:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Two windows and the door house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

286
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:02.600
<v Speaker 1>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no houses like that.</v>

287
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Like each individual house looks a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than that.</v>

288
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 1>And so in order to have that conception </v>
<v Speaker 1>of house,</v>

289
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:14.261
<v Speaker 1>what essentially what you have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take the class of all </v>

290
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:17.651
<v Speaker 1>possible houses and extract out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>features that are in common across all </v>

291
00:17:17.651 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an abstraction.</v>

292
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:24.230
<v Speaker 1>And so as far as brandon is concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't have abstractions like that,</v>

293
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.020
<v Speaker 1>which when you asked her to remember to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of church,</v>

294
00:17:27.021 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>she remembers at Church it's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>singular instances.</v>

295
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing about human beings is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

296
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:39.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we perceive singular instances to some </v>

297
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.151
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I think our abstraction </v>

298
00:17:43.151 --> 00:17:43.151
<v Speaker 1>capacity all often interferes with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to do that.</v>

299
00:17:43.151 --> 00:17:46.970
<v Speaker 1>But we also perceive abstractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can kind of tell this,</v>

300
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 1>if you're ever trying to learn to draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I say draw a hand,</v>

301
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of you,</v>

302
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:57.111
<v Speaker 1>unless you have artistic training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to drop what's essentially </v>

303
00:17:57.111 --> 00:17:57.510
<v Speaker 1>a hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific hand.</v>

304
00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the drawings,</v>

305
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:02.010
<v Speaker 1>the children come up with art drawings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think their hero glyphs,</v>

306
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.940
<v Speaker 1>they're abstracted representations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are quasi linguistic.</v>

307
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.150
<v Speaker 1>They're not artwork there pro the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

308
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

309
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.580
<v Speaker 1>and here are glyphs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

310
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:13.380
<v Speaker 1>we're one of the earliest forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>written language.</v>

311
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense because if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate about something,</v>

312
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:17.670
<v Speaker 1>why not draw an image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

313
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually the image turns into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a word.</v>

314
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:24.741
<v Speaker 1>But I actually think that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the developmental progression of </v>

315
00:18:24.741 --> 00:18:26.520
<v Speaker 1>language among human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the abstract image first,</v>

316
00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:28.750
<v Speaker 1>and then it's the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

317
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:30.690
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:35.691
<v Speaker 1>if you drew a hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to draw hero glyphic hand </v>

319
00:18:35.691 --> 00:18:35.850
<v Speaker 1>five fingers or maybe even four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

320
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what animators do.</v>

321
00:18:37.891 --> 00:18:40.410
<v Speaker 1>You can't fit all those sausages on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>circle,</v>

322
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just simplify it down to four.</v>

323
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.830
<v Speaker 1>No one even cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch an animation animated program,</v>

324
00:18:46.831 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 1>which is highly abstracted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

325
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean homer Simpson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks nothing like an actual person,</v>

326
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:57.110
<v Speaker 1>like really tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike an actual person that's </v>

327
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.110
<v Speaker 1>completely irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.370
<v Speaker 1>after two or three seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter at all.</v>

329
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Which is also why I think three d movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>never really.</v>

330
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.400
<v Speaker 1>It's never a technology that's ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught on.</v>

331
00:19:05.401 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 1>It's after the first four seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell cares?</v>

332
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.710
<v Speaker 1>It's irrelevant whether you see it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>three dimensions because you don't need </v>

333
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.190
<v Speaker 1>much information to actually structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>your perception.</v>

334
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to see your hand weirdly </v>

335
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.520
<v Speaker 1>enough so that you can draw it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to snap out of your normal mode</v>

336
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:25.521
<v Speaker 1>of perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it's often a lot easier to do </v>

337
00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:25.620
<v Speaker 1>that with one eye closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his flattens it out,</v>

338
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to stop looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hand as if it's a hand.</v>

339
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.490
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at it again like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an object and as soon as you do that,</v>

340
00:19:32.491 --> 00:19:35.540
<v Speaker 1>it's actually rather shocking because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a strange looking thing.</v>

341
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:40.541
<v Speaker 1>Like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you put your hand in a non canonical </v>

342
00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:40.770
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a canonical position.</v>

343
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say you put your hand in the non</v>
<v Speaker 1>canonical position and then look at it.</v>

344
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:46.430
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the weirdest shape thing.</v>

345
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.740
<v Speaker 1>It's quite shocking to see it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can draw it once.</v>

346
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:52.620
<v Speaker 1>You can actually see it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before that you're pretty much stuck</v>

347
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:54.420
<v Speaker 1>in hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

348
00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:00.170
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens with intelligence </v>

349
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 1>is that people are capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstracting and then they can manipulate</v>

350
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.720
<v Speaker 1>abstractions and so let's take another </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what abstractions might be.</v>

351
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:12.110
<v Speaker 1>So now part of the reason I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction is so useful is because </v>

352
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.320
<v Speaker 1>things are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really complicated and it's going to be </v>

353
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.201
<v Speaker 1>a lot more difficult to manipulate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual thing that to manipulate some </v>

354
00:20:21.201 --> 00:20:22.260
<v Speaker 1>represent to the abstraction of it.</v>

355
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 1>So if you could get an abstraction that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that captures the gist of the entity.</v>

356
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Now how will we do that is not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious,</v>

357
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:34.521
<v Speaker 1>but if you can then you can expend a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>more resources concentrating on the </v>

358
00:20:34.521 --> 00:20:36.420
<v Speaker 1>relevant parts of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the entity,</v>

359
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and a lot less time concentrating on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant parts.</v>

360
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

361
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 1>if you ask a child to draw a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what color the house is is irrelevant.</v>

362
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it's irrelevant.</v>

363
00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:53.101
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's because color can vary </v>

364
00:20:53.101 --> 00:20:56.101
<v Speaker 1>across houses and color varies across </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of other things and so color </v>

365
00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:01.170
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be a non canonical </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of house so you can just </v>

366
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:01.420
<v Speaker 1>dispense with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're thinking about a house,</v>

367
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.720
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it doesn't matter what color the </v>

368
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:06.720
<v Speaker 1>house is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still a house.</v>

369
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.440
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly defines those features </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make something a house rather than </v>

370
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.670
<v Speaker 1>something else or are not that easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out.</v>

371
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:13.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

372
00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:18.901
<v Speaker 1>well how's has four walls and a roof and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the external walls.</v>

373
00:21:19.131 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 1>And I guess you could identify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimal necessary components,</v>

374
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:24.730
<v Speaker 1>but even that's not so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so simple.</v>

375
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:30.330
<v Speaker 1>And you could say a house is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that someone lives in which </v>

376
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.771
<v Speaker 1>allows you to put caves as houses </v>
<v Speaker 1>because caves obviously share very </v>

377
00:21:34.771 --> 00:21:38.401
<v Speaker 1>little in common with a standard house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my point is,</v>

378
00:21:38.551 --> 00:21:43.551
<v Speaker 1>is that it's difficult exactly to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what set of features we do use to </v>

379
00:21:43.551 --> 00:21:46.150
<v Speaker 1>determine whether something is a member </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a class.</v>

380
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.810
<v Speaker 1>There's this guy named a Gig or answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's thought about this a lot and he </v>

381
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:56.011
<v Speaker 1>thinks that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are a combination of </v>

382
00:21:56.011 --> 00:21:58.680
<v Speaker 1>objective and functional basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that enables us to do things like </v>

383
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.430
<v Speaker 1>come up with the category of things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would take from your apartment if it was</v>

384
00:22:02.471 --> 00:22:05.620
<v Speaker 1>on fire was a really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

385
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:10.621
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because most of the things that you're </v>

386
00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:10.621
<v Speaker 1>going to take bear very little </v>
<v Speaker 1>resemblance.</v>

387
00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:11.050
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to see why they make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

388
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Pat's family members probably in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

389
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo albums,</v>

390
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.580
<v Speaker 1>identification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else might you take if you were </v>

391
00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:23.580
<v Speaker 1>your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

392
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.320
<v Speaker 1>what else would you take out of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment during a fire?</v>

393
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys would be out on the street </v>

394
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:35.940
<v Speaker 1>stark naked obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while you get the point is that you </v>

395
00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.131
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things that are just mentioned </v>

396
00:22:40.131 --> 00:22:40.330
<v Speaker 1>seem to share very little in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective features in common,</v>

397
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.760
<v Speaker 1>but there's some reason that they still </v>
<v Speaker 1>go here as a category.</v>

398
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.960
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

399
00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:45.520
<v Speaker 1>why do you need to abstract?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

400
00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:48.310
<v Speaker 1>because you can handle the complexity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world better.</v>

401
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Even your perception is a form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstraction,</v>

402
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you look at someone,</v>

403
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the abstraction has done for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because you just can't perceive very</v>

404
00:22:57.341 --> 00:22:58.600
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at someone,</v>

405
00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:03.601
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only see the surface of them that's </v>

406
00:23:03.601 --> 00:23:04.420
<v Speaker 1>facing you and not the other surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big limitation.</v>

407
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:09.760
<v Speaker 1>You only see them now in this split </v>
<v Speaker 1>second rather than extended across time.</v>

408
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.480
<v Speaker 1>You don't see any of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>microstructure right beyond the,</v>

409
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:19.020
<v Speaker 1>beyond the general pattern of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiology at this level of resolution,</v>

410
00:23:20.201 --> 00:23:21.280
<v Speaker 1>you don't see anything below that.</v>

411
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't see yourselves or your organs or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that,</v>

412
00:23:24.461 --> 00:23:29.461
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a real problem often </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us and I can't see the systems that </v>

413
00:23:29.461 --> 00:23:31.210
<v Speaker 1>you're part of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right off the bat,</v>

414
00:23:31.211 --> 00:23:36.211
<v Speaker 1>just to perceive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you a low resolution </v>

415
00:23:36.211 --> 00:23:38.590
<v Speaker 1>representation and that lot of that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations of your process and your </v>

416
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.421
<v Speaker 1>eyes just can't zoom in that far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the cortical capacity to </v>

417
00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:42.650
<v Speaker 1>improve your vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 1>plus how much do you really want to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it one time,</v>

419
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.540
<v Speaker 1>no more than necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>

420
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.940
<v Speaker 1>And evolution seems to take care of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

421
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 1>So your perception abstracts for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away,</v>

422
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:58.781
<v Speaker 1>but then I would say maybe you make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>leap from perception to conception or </v>

423
00:23:58.781 --> 00:24:03.040
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be the leap from the </v>

424
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:03.800
<v Speaker 1>perception of the actual object to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>image of the object.</v>

425
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.340
<v Speaker 1>And then elite from the image of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>object to the word.</v>

426
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.520
<v Speaker 1>So it looks to me like a word is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of an image which is a </v>

427
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.570
<v Speaker 1>representation of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an an object or situation.</v>

428
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.180
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

429
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.080
<v Speaker 1>and you need those because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the complex world.</v>

430
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:22.850
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one way of thinking about it.</v>

431
00:24:22.851 --> 00:24:25.670
<v Speaker 1>So look at the top left corner of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram.</v>

432
00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:30.671
<v Speaker 1>So I called that the thing in itself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is is it's an array of dots </v>

433
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.460
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and I think there's 360</v>
<v Speaker 1>dots there and you might say,</v>

434
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:41.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if it was a real world object </v>

435
00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:43.640
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine that would be in three</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions not to because that's too,</v>

436
00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.720
<v Speaker 1>and it would be transforming because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be also extended across time.</v>

437
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:53.230
<v Speaker 1>So and it would have micro structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were far smaller than that and </v>

438
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.600
<v Speaker 1>macro structures that were far bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so even that is an abstraction,</v>

439
00:24:56.601 --> 00:24:57.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

440
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using a fairly complex abstraction </v>

441
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 1>to rip represent the thing in itself.</v>

442
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing you cannot perceive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

443
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:10.450
<v Speaker 1>What something actually is you just get </v>
<v Speaker 1>an image and then the next five things </v>

444
00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.500
<v Speaker 1>are ways you could look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>

445
00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 1>well it's a rectangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say it's four rectangles.</v>

446
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.290
<v Speaker 1>And forget about the dots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say that it's,</v>

447
00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that 16 lines or what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 two lines,</v>

448
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 1>a 24 lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were going to,</v>

449
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:30.350
<v Speaker 1>if that thing in itself was an orchard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you are going to walk north,</v>

450
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:33.530
<v Speaker 1>south to north through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a good representation.</v>

451
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those would be corridors roughly </v>

452
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.081
<v Speaker 1>speaking and then object for is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of object one and object to </v>

453
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:45.791
<v Speaker 1>and then object five is well all of it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>blurred out or the little groups of six </v>

454
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:50.000
<v Speaker 1>dogs and so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what is that thing?</v>

455
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 1>And then the answer is well it's any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those five things.</v>

456
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.360
<v Speaker 1>And so that's an interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it too because one of the</v>

457
00:25:56.361 --> 00:26:01.361
<v Speaker 1>things that shows you is that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree about what something is right </v>

458
00:26:01.361 --> 00:26:02.090
<v Speaker 1>at the level of perception and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

459
00:26:02.091 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>well which of those is the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation?</v>

460
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And the first answer might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the most complex one,</v>

461
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:12.980
<v Speaker 1>the top one on the left hand corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not necessarily the case.</v>

462
00:26:12.981 --> 00:26:16.970
<v Speaker 1>It might depend on what you want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation for like imagine.</v>

463
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:22.180
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because imagine you have a </v>

464
00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.180
<v Speaker 1>map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

465
00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

466
00:26:22.491 --> 00:26:27.491
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make the best map in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and so you make a map that's </v>

467
00:26:27.491 --> 00:26:30.671
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same size as the territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it represents and has all the </v>

468
00:26:30.671 --> 00:26:34.781
<v Speaker 1>detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not any use at all that </v>

469
00:26:34.781 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 1>thing because you could just use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

470
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know the,</v>

471
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:43.180
<v Speaker 1>just because as a map gets increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>detailed to some degree,</v>

472
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 1>it's increasingly useless as a map.</v>

473
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:51.830
<v Speaker 1>And so what you need is this weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination between accuracy and </v>

474
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:55.491
<v Speaker 1>simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you want your map to be no more </v>

475
00:26:55.491 --> 00:26:57.630
<v Speaker 1>complicated than is necessary to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>you from point a to point b.</v>

476
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:03.140
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because otherwise it wouldn't be </v>

477
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.261
<v Speaker 1>simple to use and the additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity would eliminate the utility </v>

478
00:27:06.261 --> 00:27:07.020
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the map.</v>

479
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might say that what we're trying </v>

480
00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.471
<v Speaker 1>to do with our intelligence is to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we need with the least amount of </v>

481
00:27:15.471 --> 00:27:16.590
<v Speaker 1>effort possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

482
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:22.160
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of a psg eddie and idea </v>

483
00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:22.830
<v Speaker 1>that's lurking behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

484
00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:25.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:28.590
<v Speaker 1>you have limited resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to expend any more energy</v>

486
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:31.710
<v Speaker 1>than is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you want to build representations of</v>

487
00:27:31.711 --> 00:27:36.711
<v Speaker 1>the world that suffice to keep you going</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then next week and next month,</v>

488
00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:41.610
<v Speaker 1>and then you know alone and then in </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups and so you build a representation</v>

489
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:45.600
<v Speaker 1>of the world that has some concordance </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the thing in itself,</v>

490
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:50.601
<v Speaker 1>but has this functional simplicity so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could actually use it in the </v>

491
00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:51.090
<v Speaker 1>real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

492
00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:56.091
<v Speaker 1>so back to this diagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've got the object and five </v>

493
00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 1>representations and then there are ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>of representing it linguistically at the</v>

494
00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>

495
00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:02.020
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

496
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.660
<v Speaker 1>what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the words are basically a simplification</v>

497
00:28:06.661 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 1>of something that's already simplified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

498
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:13.431
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so intelligence seems to have something </v>

499
00:28:13.431 --> 00:28:16.020
<v Speaker 1>to do with the process of functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplification.</v>

500
00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Now back to the library of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this database of questions </v>

501
00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:30.400
<v Speaker 1>and so then what you do is pull out 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions randomly.</v>

502
00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.910
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you want to pick out 100?</v>

503
00:28:33.911 --> 00:28:38.911
<v Speaker 1>Because if you just pick out one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I asked you what the capital of </v>

504
00:28:38.911 --> 00:28:42.811
<v Speaker 1>Georgia was and I asked you what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital of Georgia was and you got it </v>

505
00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:44.590
<v Speaker 1>wrong and you got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't really say with any degree of</v>

506
00:28:44.591 --> 00:28:49.591
<v Speaker 1>certainty that that means that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>more intelligence because the </v>

507
00:28:49.591 --> 00:28:52.570
<v Speaker 1>probability that I get an accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure with one question is quite low,</v>

508
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.540
<v Speaker 1>but if I use three questions while then</v>

509
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:57.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

510
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I would start to become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My measurement would start to become </v>

511
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.970
<v Speaker 1>less error written and if I use 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would even be better if I use 20.</v>

512
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.930
<v Speaker 1>For a personality questionnaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rule of thumb,</v>

513
00:29:09.931 --> 00:29:14.931
<v Speaker 1>and this is just a rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you don't have 20 questions </v>

514
00:29:14.931 --> 00:29:19.251
<v Speaker 1>in the questionnaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have enough questions to </v>

515
00:29:19.251 --> 00:29:20.970
<v Speaker 1>really generate a reliable measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll still.</v>

516
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:25.260
<v Speaker 1>You'll still see single item measures </v>
<v Speaker 1>used in psychology,</v>

517
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:30.261
<v Speaker 1>but you can add additional accuracy bike</v>
<v Speaker 1>by increasing the number of items.</v>

518
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I designed an Iq test a while back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a pretty good.</v>

519
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.300
<v Speaker 1>We got pretty good reliability and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good validity.</v>

520
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Reliability as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you test the same set of people twice </v>

521
00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 1>and the rank order of their performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>stays the same.</v>

522
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:48.460
<v Speaker 1>So if you've got 90 on the previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>test,</v>

523
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:53.461
<v Speaker 1>you'd get 90 and if you've got 95 </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're more intelligent than </v>

524
00:29:53.461 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 1>this example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got 95 in the last one,</v>

525
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:56.080
<v Speaker 1>you'd get 95 on this one.</v>

526
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.990
<v Speaker 1>So that's reliability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get a pretty,</v>

527
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:01.810
<v Speaker 1>we could get it pretty reliable Iq test </v>
<v Speaker 1>with nine items,</v>

528
00:30:01.811 --> 00:30:06.420
<v Speaker 1>but it was substantially improved with </v>
<v Speaker 1>17 and with increments,</v>

529
00:30:06.421 --> 00:30:07.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a,</v>

530
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it?</v>

531
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Diminishing returns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a hundreds,</v>

532
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.280
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

533
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:17.281
<v Speaker 1>so you pull out a 100 questions and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take 100 people and you give them </v>

534
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:21.130
<v Speaker 1>those questions and then you score them </v>
<v Speaker 1>right and wrong.</v>

535
00:30:21.131 --> 00:30:23.890
<v Speaker 1>That's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you sum the scores.</v>

536
00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically that,</v>

537
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that the sun behaves like the average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you average the scores just to</v>

538
00:30:30.551 --> 00:30:33.640
<v Speaker 1>make the argument a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward,</v>

539
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you average the scores and so each of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you gets the average of,</v>

540
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a calculated across the times that you </v>

541
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.491
<v Speaker 1>were right and wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an approximation of the </v>

542
00:30:47.491 --> 00:30:48.220
<v Speaker 1>frequency of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how right you were.</v>

543
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:53.670
<v Speaker 1>And then we rank order you one to 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Iq,</v>

544
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:59.550
<v Speaker 1>that's all there is to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now people say Iq doesn't exist.</v>

545
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Well that's annoying because all they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is gerrymandering.</v>

546
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.540
<v Speaker 1>The definition of the word exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

547
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 1>because you can do that if you ask if a </v>
<v Speaker 1>is equivalent to be.</v>

548
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:16.080
<v Speaker 1>The answer is it depends on what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean by a and what you mean by being.</v>

549
00:31:16.081 --> 00:31:21.081
<v Speaker 1>It's almost always a foolish question </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can take b and a and bend </v>

550
00:31:21.081 --> 00:31:25.741
<v Speaker 1>them and twist them in such a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make one thing and another </v>

551
00:31:25.741 --> 00:31:28.981
<v Speaker 1>thing without too much problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People usually get around that by only </v>

552
00:31:28.981 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 1>using a word in a context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

553
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:35.281
<v Speaker 1>In a sentence or a phrase or a paragraph</v>
<v Speaker 1>that defines the word so that you can't </v>

554
00:31:35.281 --> 00:31:37.510
<v Speaker 1>weasel around like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

555
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:43.380
<v Speaker 1>but more specifically in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have methods to tell if something is </v>

556
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.230
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

557
00:31:44.231 --> 00:31:45.310
<v Speaker 1>and psych ad.</v>

558
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:50.370
<v Speaker 1>If Iq doesn't pass the test of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a psychological measure,</v>

559
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:56.610
<v Speaker 1>then no other psychological measures </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed the tests because they're </v>

560
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.770
<v Speaker 1>validated exactly the same way I cue is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't work as well,</v>

561
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.140
<v Speaker 1>so you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

562
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.960
<v Speaker 1>that's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you have to throw out,</v>

563
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:10.410
<v Speaker 1>you probably have to throw out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social sciences completely in so far as </v>

564
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.831
<v Speaker 1>they're actually sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the same statistics are used to </v>

565
00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:14.980
<v Speaker 1>generate their findings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't just say,</v>

566
00:32:14.981 --> 00:32:19.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this really powerful thing doesn't </v>

567
00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:21.541
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well a bunch of these weak things exist </v>

568
00:32:21.541 --> 00:32:21.541
<v Speaker 1>and they're measured the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to play that game.</v>

569
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.320
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

570
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:24.460
<v Speaker 1>So does it exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

571
00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:27.130
<v Speaker 1>you can measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can measure it reliably.</v>

572
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's definitely something you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>

573
00:32:29.741 --> 00:32:32.530
<v Speaker 1>well there's your shadow exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

574
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.620
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under normal conditions,</v>

575
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:37.810
<v Speaker 1>you condition your shadow relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable,</v>

576
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it exist?</v>

577
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Well it passes one test of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't detect it with a number of </v>

578
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:49.040
<v Speaker 1>senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't touch it,</v>

579
00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:51.370
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

580
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 1>whether or not something exists is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a rather tricky question,</v>

581
00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:00.430
<v Speaker 1>but you can measure it and it's useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a bad definition of,</v>

582
00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:10.810
<v Speaker 1>of exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's it good for?</v>

583
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it predicts major life outcomes.</v>

584
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:19.790
<v Speaker 1>And importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

585
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:24.930
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can talk about the power of </v>

586
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.651
<v Speaker 1>intelligence momentarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were actually going to calculate </v>

587
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:32.621
<v Speaker 1>an Iq score per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would take the rank order that I </v>

588
00:33:32.621 --> 00:33:36.080
<v Speaker 1>just described and you would correct it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for age because you know,</v>

589
00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 1>you can't really expect a seven year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know as much as a 15 year old or a 20</v>

590
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:42.800
<v Speaker 1>year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So generally speaking,</v>

591
00:33:42.801 --> 00:33:46.430
<v Speaker 1>if you take a technical Iq test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will rank order you,</v>

592
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:50.180
<v Speaker 1>but it'll only rank order you with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people of the same age as you.</v>

593
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's just another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.460
<v Speaker 1>it's an additional correction whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that actually gives you a more </v>

595
00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 1>accurate estimate of Iq is depends on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you mean by accurate.</v>

596
00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:06.120
<v Speaker 1>A very bright seven year old generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know enough to do much useful in</v>

597
00:34:08.251 --> 00:34:11.160
<v Speaker 1>the way of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can learn extremely quickly.</v>

598
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:12.150
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

599
00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:13.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

600
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.840
<v Speaker 1>if you compared seven year olds to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people of other ages purely in terms of </v>

601
00:34:20.301 --> 00:34:25.301
<v Speaker 1>their score on an Iq test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a high probability that you </v>

602
00:34:25.301 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 1>would underestimate their speed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

603
00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:29.600
<v Speaker 1>By the same token though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you're 40,</v>

604
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.850
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of accumulated knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if,</v>

605
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 1>if you only measured learning speed than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would underestimate,</v>

606
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:43.240
<v Speaker 1>you would overestimate that seven year </v>
<v Speaker 1>olds advantage over the 40 year old Iq </v>

607
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:50.530
<v Speaker 1>is basically a unitary phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can fractionated into.</v>

608
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:57.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated for reasons that I'll </v>

609
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.720
<v Speaker 1>tell you about in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to divide Iq into two,</v>

610
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.340
<v Speaker 1>the way you would divide it would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>into crystallized and fluid intelligence</v>

611
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:09.700
<v Speaker 1>and fluid intelligence would be roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to learn and crystallized.</v>

612
00:35:10.491 --> 00:35:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence would be roughly a measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of how much you've learned.</v>

613
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Now those are separate to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's why.</v>

614
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.930
<v Speaker 1>They're separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you age,</v>

615
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:25.430
<v Speaker 1>your capacity to learn decreases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite ugly,</v>

616
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.710
<v Speaker 1>so by the time you were about 24,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're starting to get stupider from the</v>

617
00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:35.711
<v Speaker 1>perspective of being able to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just pretty much a linear </v>

618
00:35:35.711 --> 00:35:36.740
<v Speaker 1>trip downhill until you depart the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

619
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

620
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.700
<v Speaker 1>it's nasty to see because it's quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>steep degeneration.</v>

621
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:46.910
<v Speaker 1>You can stave that off by the way with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular and cardiovascular </v>

622
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:52.041
<v Speaker 1>exercise and weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the best way to keep your </v>

623
00:35:52.041 --> 00:35:54.180
<v Speaker 1>learning capacity attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not to do cognitive exercises,</v>

624
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 1>instituting physical exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then as you age,</v>

625
00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:02.190
<v Speaker 1>then the amount you know goes up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is those two things are </v>

626
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 1>actually tend to average out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might say,</v>

627
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm claiming that Iq,</v>

628
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:12.501
<v Speaker 1>is this a unitary thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I make the claim that you can </v>

629
00:36:12.501 --> 00:36:15.831
<v Speaker 1>divide it into two elements and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>those elements are in some sense </v>

630
00:36:15.831 --> 00:36:17.580
<v Speaker 1>separate and I think the reason is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

631
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.880
<v Speaker 1>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your prefrontal Cortex,</v>

632
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:26.210
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the part of your brain here </v>

633
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.670
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about in part,</v>

634
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:29.490
<v Speaker 1>it's the part that does the programming </v>
<v Speaker 1>of motor activity,</v>

635
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:34.491
<v Speaker 1>voluntary motor activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also seems to be so let's say </v>

636
00:36:34.491 --> 00:36:38.310
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something new and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty clunky and awkward at it and then</v>

637
00:36:38.311 --> 00:36:43.311
<v Speaker 1>you do it more and more and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoother and smoother and smoother out </v>

638
00:36:43.311 --> 00:36:43.311
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you tell them,</v>

639
00:36:43.311 --> 00:36:48.010
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you're using your </v>
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal cortex and to some degree </v>

640
00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.670
<v Speaker 1>your whole right hemisphere when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>first doing it,</v>

641
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.680
<v Speaker 1>and then as you get better and better at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

642
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.410
<v Speaker 1>the ability shifts to the left and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes backwards.</v>

643
00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:01.850
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening to some degree is </v>
<v Speaker 1>your prefrontal cortex is programming </v>

644
00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:06.030
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your brain and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of fluid intelligence as a measure</v>

645
00:37:06.031 --> 00:37:11.031
<v Speaker 1>of the ability of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your brain to program itself and </v>

646
00:37:11.551 --> 00:37:16.551
<v Speaker 1>crystallized ability as a measure of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much programming is there and then so </v>

647
00:37:16.981 --> 00:37:19.920
<v Speaker 1>they're separate in that manner because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they performed separate functions.</v>

648
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.820
<v Speaker 1>But then you can also understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the better your programmer is,</v>

649
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.980
<v Speaker 1>the better the programming is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

650
00:37:25.981 --> 00:37:30.981
<v Speaker 1>So that inflates the correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can have two separate things </v>

651
00:37:30.981 --> 00:37:34.680
<v Speaker 1>functional functionally that are even </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissociable in terms of age,</v>

652
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:36.870
<v Speaker 1>but because they work so tightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

653
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:42.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like how fast can you dig a hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how big is the pile of dirt?</v>

654
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously those two things are different</v>

655
00:37:44.281 --> 00:37:49.281
<v Speaker 1>in some important sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to be highly </v>

656
00:37:49.281 --> 00:37:49.281
<v Speaker 1>correlated because the faster you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a whole,</v>

657
00:37:49.281 --> 00:37:52.740
<v Speaker 1>the bigger the pile of dirt and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

658
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:57.420
<v Speaker 1>crystallized intelligence is often also </v>
<v Speaker 1>often measured as verbal intelligence,</v>

659
00:37:57.421 --> 00:38:01.590
<v Speaker 1>but the better measure fundamentally is </v>
<v Speaker 1>crystallized intelligence.</v>

660
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Now you know how we looked at the I </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality hierarchy,</v>

661
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:14.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was this and what you see is three </v>

662
00:38:15.781 --> 00:38:20.550
<v Speaker 1>strata roughly speaking aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait super factor,</v>

663
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:26.390
<v Speaker 1>and it looks like the super factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the validity of those super </v>

664
00:38:27.331 --> 00:38:32.331
<v Speaker 1>factors is not yet clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get a lot of useful prediction </v>

665
00:38:32.331 --> 00:38:35.260
<v Speaker 1>by looking at the traits and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more evidence.</v>

666
00:38:35.261 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 1>There's about 400 studies now using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects.</v>

667
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:43.830
<v Speaker 1>There's more and more evidence that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can also derive additional useful </v>

668
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.950
<v Speaker 1>predictive validity from differentiating</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

669
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.530
<v Speaker 1>the personality down to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

670
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the aspect level.</v>

671
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's the highest resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality model we have.</v>

672
00:38:55.060 --> 00:39:00.060
<v Speaker 1>There are people who claim that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something at the apex which you might </v>

673
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.500
<v Speaker 1>call good personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think so.</v>

674
00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

675
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.190
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to read the literature to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the,</v>

676
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:13.080
<v Speaker 1>the dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a statistical dispute roughly </v>

677
00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:13.080
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

678
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:18.180
<v Speaker 1>we've found in our research that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability and plasticity early </v>

679
00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.280
<v Speaker 1>correlated at point two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty separate.</v>

680
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.520
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to stick with that for now </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it might be wrong.</v>

681
00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.370
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

682
00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

683
00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:57.410
<v Speaker 3>can you explain this properly?</v>

684
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:11.230
<v Speaker 1>If you read the cognitive literature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neuropsychological literature,</v>

685
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you will find that neuro psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to assume that there are forms of </v>

686
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:23.791
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability that you cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe as Iq and they make that claim </v>

687
00:40:25.161 --> 00:40:30.161
<v Speaker 1>because they'll take a test and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll use the test to measure </v>

688
00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:31.960
<v Speaker 1>something and then no correlate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Iq.</v>

689
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:35.200
<v Speaker 1>And the correlation will only be about </v>
<v Speaker 1>point two or point three.</v>

690
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.520
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

691
00:40:36.521 --> 00:40:41.521
<v Speaker 1>that's not a high enough correlation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>justify saying that those things are </v>

692
00:40:41.681 --> 00:40:46.681
<v Speaker 1>identical because the correlation should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be more like point eight for them to be </v>

693
00:40:46.681 --> 00:40:47.230
<v Speaker 1>identical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

694
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 1>let's say I had a measure of your Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Iq and your Iq,</v>

695
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:56.220
<v Speaker 1>your Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I asked you two questions and </v>

696
00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.911
<v Speaker 1>you and you and you and I summed your </v>
<v Speaker 1>answers whether they were correct or </v>

697
00:40:59.911 --> 00:41:02.560
<v Speaker 1>incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what would happen is there'd be some</v>

698
00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:07.060
<v Speaker 1>correlation between your total score on </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two questions and your overall Iq.</v>

699
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would be point three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that wouldn't justify me in planning</v>

700
00:41:12.381 --> 00:41:17.270
<v Speaker 1>that the two question Iq test is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than the full scale Iq test.</v>

701
00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.830
<v Speaker 1>It's just worse</v>

702
00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:24.940
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to run into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem when you read psychological </v>

703
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.931
<v Speaker 1>literature and if you ever do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do any research because it's very </v>

704
00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:31.040
<v Speaker 1>difficult to determine whether you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called discriminant validity,</v>

705
00:41:31.041 --> 00:41:36.041
<v Speaker 1>which is this thing measures this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing measures this thing and </v>

706
00:41:36.041 --> 00:41:40.181
<v Speaker 1>they're actually different or whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have a lousy measure of this </v>

707
00:41:40.181 --> 00:41:41.990
<v Speaker 1>and allows you measure of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the correlation is low.</v>

708
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Now here's a neuropsychological test and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make the case that this is </v>

709
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:55.750
<v Speaker 1>measuring something different than Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you see an array of 12 </v>

710
00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:00.440
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just drawings,</v>

711
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.140
<v Speaker 1>drawings of a telephone and a boot and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chair.</v>

712
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Just common objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

713
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:09.701
<v Speaker 1>So you see 12 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to click one and then </v>

714
00:42:09.701 --> 00:42:13.400
<v Speaker 1>when you do that they move and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next time you have to click one,</v>

715
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:18.401
<v Speaker 1>you haven't already clicked and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they move again and you click and they </v>

716
00:42:18.401 --> 00:42:21.860
<v Speaker 1>move again and you click and you see by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time you get to about eight of them,</v>

717
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:27.100
<v Speaker 1>you're starting to run into trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's difficult to remember more </v>

718
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.590
<v Speaker 1>than eight abstraction simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven actually in some people claim it's</v>

719
00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:33.800
<v Speaker 1>as low as four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the capacity of working memory,</v>

720
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:37.000
<v Speaker 1>which is why we kind of like phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers to be seven digits long.</v>

721
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.790
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the things we want to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember r s r seven,</v>

722
00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:46.260
<v Speaker 1>you long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we want to remember more than </v>

723
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:46.260
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we chunk.</v>

724
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Although you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I show you some dots,</v>

725
00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:50.860
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

726
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.800
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how many dogs?</v>

727
00:42:52.801 --> 00:42:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to count them.</v>

728
00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:56.520
<v Speaker 1>You can see three dogs.</v>

729
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.980
<v Speaker 1>You can see for dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious that you can see five </v>

730
00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.390
<v Speaker 1>dots at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start to go three and two.</v>

731
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:14.080
<v Speaker 1>And then if there are six dots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's how they would be arranged </v>

732
00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.620
<v Speaker 1>on a dice dice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

733
00:43:15.621 --> 00:43:20.621
<v Speaker 1>The reason they'd be reached on the dice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way is because you could see two </v>

734
00:43:20.621 --> 00:43:20.690
<v Speaker 1>sets of three and for six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

735
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 1>if there are sort of randomly dispersed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

736
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how many dots is that one?</v>

737
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:32.381
<v Speaker 1>You have character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that shows you is that your </v>

738
00:43:32.381 --> 00:43:36.101
<v Speaker 1>working memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really a function of fluid </v>

739
00:43:36.101 --> 00:43:36.101
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very,</v>

740
00:43:36.101 --> 00:43:37.880
<v Speaker 1>very narrow thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like your vision.</v>

741
00:43:37.881 --> 00:43:39.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember we saw the gorilla video,</v>

742
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:41.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can only pick up the thing that</v>

743
00:43:41.991 --> 00:43:43.760
<v Speaker 1>you're attending to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

744
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.070
<v Speaker 1>working memories like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this narrow,</v>

745
00:43:46.071 --> 00:43:50.930
<v Speaker 1>narrow form of attention and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of specifies unitary phenomenon.</v>

746
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not quite unitary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's close enough.</v>

747
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason that it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

748
00:43:55.281 --> 00:44:00.281
<v Speaker 1>it's like why is your attention so </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow is because often what you're </v>

749
00:44:00.281 --> 00:44:02.750
<v Speaker 1>trying to do as you work in the world is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make binary choices.</v>

750
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:08.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to choose between 20 </v>

751
00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.121
<v Speaker 1>things you want to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to choose between two things </v>

752
00:44:10.121 --> 00:44:10.730
<v Speaker 1>because then when you choose between two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

753
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:13.850
<v Speaker 1>you can actually act if it's still two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things can't act.</v>

754
00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:18.851
<v Speaker 1>If it's one thing you could act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you go into Chinese </v>

755
00:44:18.851 --> 00:44:22.151
<v Speaker 1>restaurant is a good example because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese restaurants virtually always </v>

756
00:44:22.151 --> 00:44:24.530
<v Speaker 1>have like 400 items on the menu and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might ask yourself,</v>

757
00:44:24.531 --> 00:44:29.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you figure out what you </v>

758
00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:30.510
<v Speaker 1>want and what you don't do is go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single menu item and,</v>

759
00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.180
<v Speaker 1>and it because you'd be there for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

760
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 1>So what you seem to do is eradicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks.</v>

761
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:41.750
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not in the mood for anything </v>

762
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:42.420
<v Speaker 1>but fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay Bang.</v>

763
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Three quarters of the menu disappears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

764
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:48.330
<v Speaker 1>And then you might go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't want it brandon whack.</v>

765
00:44:48.331 --> 00:44:53.331
<v Speaker 1>And then another half is gone and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're down to maybe eight choices and </v>

766
00:44:53.331 --> 00:44:57.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you reduce that to four and then two to </v>

767
00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:57.610
<v Speaker 1>perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'd like this or I'd like that.</v>

768
00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:02.480
<v Speaker 1>But the waiter doesn't care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The waiter wants to know which one you </v>

769
00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.620
<v Speaker 1>want because until it's reduced to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to act.</v>

770
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:10.160
<v Speaker 1>And so the reduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reduced narrow strip that we use to </v>

771
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:14.160
<v Speaker 1>perceive the world and partly is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of processing inadequacy,</v>

772
00:45:14.161 --> 00:45:17.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly because we really </v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to reduce things all the time</v>

773
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:19.470
<v Speaker 1>to zero in one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

774
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes or no.</v>

775
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:24.540
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so back to the this three stratum theory</v>

776
00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:29.541
<v Speaker 1>of cognitive abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've got this array of 12 items </v>

777
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:37.221
<v Speaker 1>and it keeps shifting and then what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do is score you by the number of </v>

778
00:45:37.221 --> 00:45:41.750
<v Speaker 1>duplications you if you pick the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind that more than once you lose a </v>

779
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:42.960
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the maximum points you can get is 12.</v>

780
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:47.961
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people usually make three or four </v>

781
00:45:47.961 --> 00:45:50.451
<v Speaker 1>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I could take your score on that </v>

782
00:45:50.451 --> 00:45:53.121
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'd give it to you two or three </v>

783
00:45:53.121 --> 00:45:54.981
<v Speaker 1>times just to make sure I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably stable indicator and then I </v>

784
00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:56.160
<v Speaker 1>can correlate it with your full scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid Iq.</v>

785
00:45:56.161 --> 00:45:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And I get a correlation of about point </v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

786
00:45:58.141 --> 00:46:00.090
<v Speaker 1>five or point three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

787
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.000
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics,</v>

788
00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:03.570
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

789
00:46:03.571 --> 00:46:08.571
<v Speaker 1>well that's obviously measuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>something different than full scale Iq </v>

790
00:46:08.571 --> 00:46:09.990
<v Speaker 1>because it only correlates at point two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or point three,</v>

791
00:46:09.991 --> 00:46:14.991
<v Speaker 1>but what it turns out is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more analogous to the problem that </v>

792
00:46:14.991 --> 00:46:18.081
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about where I asked</v>
<v Speaker 1>you three questions and tried to derive </v>

793
00:46:18.081 --> 00:46:20.460
<v Speaker 1>your entire icu from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bad measurement.</v>

794
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens is if you take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological tests that people </v>

795
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.531
<v Speaker 1>have developed that theoretically assess</v>
<v Speaker 1>the function of different parts of the </v>

796
00:46:30.531 --> 00:46:33.951
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and you factor in analyze them and </v>

797
00:46:33.951 --> 00:46:35.580
<v Speaker 1>you extract out a single factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the single factor,</v>

798
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:37.650
<v Speaker 1>it looks exactly like fluid </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

799
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it exactly the same as fluid </v>

800
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.010
<v Speaker 1>intelligence?</v>

801
00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:50.370
<v Speaker 1>It would be the onus would be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who claims it's not to </v>

802
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.571
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did give university students have a </v>

803
00:46:53.571 --> 00:46:57.231
<v Speaker 1>very extensive battery of prefrontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortical tests and measured their Iq and</v>

804
00:46:57.511 --> 00:47:02.511
<v Speaker 1>then we used the prefrontal cortical </v>
<v Speaker 1>test average and the ICU to predict </v>

805
00:47:02.671 --> 00:47:07.671
<v Speaker 1>grades and what we did find was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal tests predicted over and </v>

806
00:47:07.671 --> 00:47:11.241
<v Speaker 1>above the eye Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we thought maybe if you don't,</v>

807
00:47:12.641 --> 00:47:17.580
<v Speaker 1>the prefrontal average and the ICU and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you added them to to predict grade,</v>

808
00:47:17.581 --> 00:47:22.050
<v Speaker 1>say that's a regression analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both added in so they predict.</v>

809
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.140
<v Speaker 1>They predicted different parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation.</v>

810
00:47:25.141 --> 00:47:27.930
<v Speaker 1>It added additional you necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

811
00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:33.140
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you took all the neuropsychological </v>

812
00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:37.620
<v Speaker 1>tests and all the individual Iq tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you put them in one data set and </v>

813
00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:40.840
<v Speaker 1>then extracted out a single factor is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be fluid intelligence roughly</v>

814
00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>

815
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:47.070
<v Speaker 1>That predicted grades very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what was leftover didn't </v>

816
00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:50.131
<v Speaker 1>predict it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we concluded was that </v>

817
00:47:50.131 --> 00:47:52.090
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychological tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal cortical tests,</v>

818
00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:56.260
<v Speaker 1>test intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they test a slightly different thing</v>

819
00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:02.010
<v Speaker 1>than fluid intelligence tests do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't because they're testing </v>

820
00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:06.061
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because fluid intelligence tests </v>

821
00:48:06.061 --> 00:48:08.701
<v Speaker 1>the way they're currently constituted </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't sample the universe of potential </v>

822
00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:14.551
<v Speaker 1>questions as well as they should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't that we discovered </v>

823
00:48:14.551 --> 00:48:18.841
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We discovered a measurement error </v>

824
00:48:18.841 --> 00:48:18.841
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that only took five years.</v>

825
00:48:18.841 --> 00:48:20.410
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took five years to figure that out.</v>

826
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:23.410
<v Speaker 1>It was very annoying because when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

827
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to predict grades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

828
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:31.261
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't know the ICU literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well at that point because </v>

829
00:48:31.261 --> 00:48:35.821
<v Speaker 1>psychologist don't usually teach it very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much because Iq bothers the hell out of </v>

830
00:48:35.821 --> 00:48:40.531
<v Speaker 1>everybody and so and the neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists who have their own field </v>

831
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.190
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

832
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:47.220
<v Speaker 1>they're motivated to make the claim that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've discovered something new and I </v>

833
00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:47.220
<v Speaker 1>just took that on face value.</v>

834
00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.720
<v Speaker 1>But then we tried to predict like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

835
00:48:49.721 --> 00:48:54.721
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to predict how well you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>at your job while I want to get a good </v>

836
00:48:54.721 --> 00:48:55.780
<v Speaker 1>cognitive measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it's a complex job,</v>

837
00:48:55.810 --> 00:49:00.810
<v Speaker 1>because if it's a complex job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps changing and you have to learn </v>

838
00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:01.390
<v Speaker 1>to keep up and if you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do very well.</v>

839
00:49:01.391 --> 00:49:04.810
<v Speaker 1>So that will be bad for you and it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be bad for everyone around you.</v>

840
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And so we were trying to pick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional information that would enable</v>

841
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:16.740
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accuracy of that prediction to be </v>

842
00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:17.200
<v Speaker 1>increased and looked at the neuro psych </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

843
00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:20.560
<v Speaker 1>But at most it was an ambivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

844
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does that relate to this?</v>

845
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom tier where it's the most </v>

846
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 1>differentiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have single tests and there are only</v>

847
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.680
<v Speaker 1>correlated with each other at about </v>
<v Speaker 1>point to maybe point three.</v>

848
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:37.710
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're all measuring different </v>

849
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.710
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

850
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:38.020
<v Speaker 1>they're all measuring the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>

851
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:42.550
<v Speaker 1>And then you might clump them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say I asked you,</v>

852
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I give you a test that asks you </v>

853
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:52.170
<v Speaker 1>tested your vocabulary with six letter </v>
<v Speaker 1>words and then I gave you another test </v>

854
00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.830
<v Speaker 1>that tested you vocabulary with seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter words and another one that tested</v>

855
00:49:53.831 --> 00:49:56.230
<v Speaker 1>your vocabulary with eight letter words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

856
00:49:56.231 --> 00:49:57.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are all different tests.</v>

857
00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:00.700
<v Speaker 1>While they would correlate quite highly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not perfectly,</v>

858
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:04.900
<v Speaker 1>but I can clump them together and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>one sort of super test out at them.</v>

859
00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:09.901
<v Speaker 1>And then I could take super test a and </v>
<v Speaker 1>super testy and super test B C and look </v>

860
00:50:10.391 --> 00:50:13.810
<v Speaker 1>at the correlations between those and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those would climb to about point five or</v>

861
00:50:13.811 --> 00:50:18.811
<v Speaker 1>point six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if I clump the super tests </v>

862
00:50:18.811 --> 00:50:21.661
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be happening by the time we </v>

863
00:50:21.661 --> 00:50:23.761
<v Speaker 1>got to stratum to there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the correlation between the tests </v>

864
00:50:23.761 --> 00:50:24.790
<v Speaker 1>would start to rise to the bug point </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>

865
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.550
<v Speaker 1>And then if I collapsed all the super </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests into a single measure,</v>

866
00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:34.020
<v Speaker 1>then the correlation between any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those stratum to tests and g because </v>

867
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.890
<v Speaker 1>that would be the highest level thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>G is general intelligence.</v>

868
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.080
<v Speaker 1>That's roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fluid intelligence.</v>

869
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:44.300
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between any of the super</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests and g would be about point eight.</v>

870
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:50.350
<v Speaker 1>So the point of all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way of discussing this sort </v>

871
00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:54.911
<v Speaker 1>of thing without doing it statistically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and technically because are statistical </v>

872
00:50:54.911 --> 00:50:56.350
<v Speaker 1>and technical processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is,</v>

873
00:50:56.351 --> 00:51:01.310
<v Speaker 1>is that now let's say now you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure of fluid intelligence.</v>

874
00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got this measure and you take one</v>

875
00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:09.761
<v Speaker 1>of the stratum two sets of tests and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>use both to predict academic </v>

876
00:51:09.761 --> 00:51:14.140
<v Speaker 1>achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that the super factor g </v>

877
00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:16.730
<v Speaker 1>kills the rest of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just not going to be able to find</v>

878
00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:22.180
<v Speaker 1>any of the tests in the bottom strata </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going to add to the prediction </v>

879
00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:24.140
<v Speaker 1>of what the general factor can give you.</v>

880
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Now with with with personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not the case.</v>

881
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:33.010
<v Speaker 1>You can't pull out a single factor that </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicts how personality is going to </v>

882
00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:33.950
<v Speaker 1>influence jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

883
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.820
<v Speaker 1>performance across your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you add neuroticism,</v>

884
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:42.170
<v Speaker 1>if you take the single factor and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>add neuroticism,</v>

885
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:44.420
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism is going to kick the single </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor out.</v>

886
00:51:44.421 --> 00:51:49.421
<v Speaker 1>Conscientiousness is gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick the single factor out and so forth </v>

887
00:51:49.421 --> 00:51:50.510
<v Speaker 1>because there isn't a single factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

888
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.960
<v Speaker 1>The tests aren't highly correlated </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to say that they're all measuring</v>

889
00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:58.961
<v Speaker 1>the same thing to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The personality traits really are </v>

890
00:51:58.961 --> 00:52:02.051
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you can clump them into </v>

891
00:52:02.051 --> 00:52:02.051
<v Speaker 1>plasticity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instability,</v>

892
00:52:02.051 --> 00:52:02.051
<v Speaker 1>but even there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your loot you,</v>

893
00:52:02.051 --> 00:52:07.020
<v Speaker 1>you're maintaining a lot of validity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I took stability and then he used </v>

894
00:52:07.881 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness to predict job </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>

895
00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:12.170
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness would white boats </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability,</v>

896
00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:14.240
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a better measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you never get that.</v>

897
00:52:14.241 --> 00:52:17.660
<v Speaker 1>You virtually never get that with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lower tests in the ICU straddle.</v>

898
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

899
00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:24.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I just talked to you about that.</v>

900
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

901
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:29.360
<v Speaker 1>that's a good representation of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are associated.</v>

902
00:52:29.361 --> 00:52:34.361
<v Speaker 1>So at the bottom you have the single </v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks and then they chunk into say </v>

903
00:52:34.361 --> 00:52:38.741
<v Speaker 1>sequential reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantitative reasoning and induction on </v>

904
00:52:38.741 --> 00:52:42.101
<v Speaker 1>the fluid intelligence size side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>general knowledge and language </v>

905
00:52:42.101 --> 00:52:43.040
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the crystallized intelligence side,</v>

906
00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:47.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're all subsumed underneath</v>

907
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:52.990
<v Speaker 1>fluid intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the measure that you really </v>

908
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:52.990
<v Speaker 1>want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

909
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:55.100
<v Speaker 1>So what good is that?</v>

910
00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it basically correlates point five with </v>

911
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:05.100
<v Speaker 1>major life outcomes and that's 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the variance and maybe you </v>

912
00:53:05.801 --> 00:53:10.801
<v Speaker 1>can get into a bit higher than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will just stick with point five </v>

913
00:53:10.801 --> 00:53:11.560
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a representation.</v>

914
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:13.900
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say,</v>

915
00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:21.850
<v Speaker 1>let's say you take a bunch of students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 of them,</v>

916
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:27.600
<v Speaker 1>and you want to sort them into those who</v>
<v Speaker 1>will pass a class with a 50 percent </v>

917
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:28.950
<v Speaker 1>failure rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

918
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.080
<v Speaker 1>So you just pick them randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to pass,</v>

919
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pass,</v>

920
00:53:32.191 --> 00:53:34.380
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's no knowledge.</v>

921
00:53:34.381 --> 00:53:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I have no predictive dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

922
00:53:36.061 --> 00:53:41.061
<v Speaker 1>so my validity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the validity of my classification is </v>

923
00:53:41.061 --> 00:53:42.420
<v Speaker 1>basically going to be equivalent chat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

924
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:47.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only going to have a 50 percent </v>

925
00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:47.770
<v Speaker 1>chance of picking who passes and who </v>
<v Speaker 1>fails.</v>

926
00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:52.700
<v Speaker 1>If I used Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had all your Iq scores and I did </v>

927
00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.410
<v Speaker 1>the prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get right 75 percent of the time,</v>

928
00:53:56.550 --> 00:54:01.550
<v Speaker 1>so it's a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It cuts the failure rate in half by </v>

929
00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:05.331
<v Speaker 1>using ICU and ICU is a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictor of health and it's a predictor</v>

930
00:54:05.851 --> 00:54:10.851
<v Speaker 1>of longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of resistance to </v>

931
00:54:10.851 --> 00:54:10.851
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

932
00:54:10.851 --> 00:54:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupational status.</v>

933
00:54:13.621 --> 00:54:17.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of educational success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of income,</v>

934
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:23.600
<v Speaker 1>it's very powerful predictor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's another way of </v>

935
00:54:23.941 --> 00:54:28.941
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing its effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you could choose how you</v>

936
00:54:29.281 --> 00:54:34.281
<v Speaker 1>were going to be when you were born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is in North America because </v>

937
00:54:34.281 --> 00:54:35.280
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna vary by society at least to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree.</v>

938
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.740
<v Speaker 1>You get to be born into a family that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the 95th percentile for wealth,</v>

939
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:46.040
<v Speaker 1>or you get to be born at the 95th </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile for intelligence who's better</v>

940
00:54:46.081 --> 00:54:51.081
<v Speaker 1>off at the age of 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is the person who picks </v>

941
00:54:51.081 --> 00:54:54.510
<v Speaker 1>being born with an Iq in the 95th </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile at birth,</v>

942
00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:57.030
<v Speaker 1>it's more powerful predictor of longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>life outcome.</v>

943
00:54:57.031 --> 00:54:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Then familial wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

944
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:07.190
<v Speaker 1>and it shows up everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things we did recently </v>

945
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:10.581
<v Speaker 1>was looking at disgust sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk a little bit about </v>

946
00:55:10.581 --> 00:55:12.120
<v Speaker 1>that when we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness because orderly people</v>

947
00:55:12.121 --> 00:55:15.480
<v Speaker 1>seem to be more sensitive to discuss the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorderly people.</v>

948
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:20.750
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be why they're ordering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the higher you are in Icu,</v>

949
00:55:20.971 --> 00:55:23.880
<v Speaker 1>the less disgust sensitive you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

950
00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:26.580
<v Speaker 1>we don't know exactly why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because,</v>

951
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:31.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could make the inference that </v>

952
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:34.761
<v Speaker 1>Iq is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in related in some way to the </v>

953
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:36.840
<v Speaker 1>physiological integrity of the Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

954
00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:40.290
<v Speaker 1>rather than the limbic system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the source of say,</v>

955
00:55:40.291 --> 00:55:42.640
<v Speaker 1>emotions and motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

956
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:48.500
<v Speaker 1>and the more powerful it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more inhibitory capacity it has over</v>

957
00:55:49.441 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 1>the more fundamental motivations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions you could make that case.</v>

958
00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:58.680
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that intelligent people don't </v>

959
00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.370
<v Speaker 1>necessarily seem to be any less </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>

960
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:05.150
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can have a pretty vicious </v>

961
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:08.721
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by extremely disorganized </v>

962
00:56:08.721 --> 00:56:12.081
<v Speaker 1>behavior and a complete inability to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm plans into operation and still </v>

963
00:56:12.081 --> 00:56:16.881
<v Speaker 1>have a high Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are the things we really can't </v>

964
00:56:16.881 --> 00:56:21.291
<v Speaker 1>figure out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a hell of a thing to try to </v>

965
00:56:21.291 --> 00:56:24.351
<v Speaker 1>figure out is like the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Iq and industriousness is zero </v>

966
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:30.510
<v Speaker 1>and that just makes no sense to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the brain models are </v>

967
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:34.651
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that your ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to engage in longterm planning is the </v>

968
00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 1>factor that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

969
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:42.220
<v Speaker 1>But then industrious people seem to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only engage in longterm planning,</v>

970
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:44.860
<v Speaker 1>they seem to do it right so that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are more industrious,</v>

971
00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:47.770
<v Speaker 1>they put their plans into operation then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plans that actually work,</v>

972
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's not correlated with Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I can't figure out,</v>

973
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:57.481
<v Speaker 1>well obviously the industrious person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways able to regulate their own </v>

974
00:56:57.481 --> 00:56:59.620
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not procrastinating,</v>

975
00:56:59.621 --> 00:57:02.950
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd think that that the ability to</v>

976
00:57:02.951 --> 00:57:06.520
<v Speaker 1>not procrastinate would be a cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature,</v>

977
00:57:06.521 --> 00:57:11.521
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't seem to be and we have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea what makes people industrious and </v>

978
00:57:11.521 --> 00:57:15.121
<v Speaker 1>we can't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's this incredibly potent </v>

979
00:57:15.121 --> 00:57:18.151
<v Speaker 1>predictor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just about as powerful as ICU and </v>

980
00:57:18.151 --> 00:57:20.230
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

981
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:26.670
<v Speaker 1>So if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a smart idea about that and </v>

982
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:29.911
<v Speaker 1>you want to pursue it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like feel free because there's a big </v>

983
00:57:29.911 --> 00:57:32.190
<v Speaker 1>mystery there that no one's been able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack and we'd been added for a long </v>

984
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:33.610
<v Speaker 1>time and have had almost no success.</v>

985
00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:38.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had people do things like give them </v>

986
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:41.041
<v Speaker 1>sentences of ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ams and use sort of randomly distributed</v>

987
00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:42.820
<v Speaker 1>and then we'd have them count the use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

988
00:57:42.821 --> 00:57:47.821
<v Speaker 1>like a whole page of sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not census or just strings of </v>

989
00:57:47.821 --> 00:57:49.420
<v Speaker 1>letter county use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How useless,</v>

990
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:54.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd think that someone industrious </v>

991
00:57:54.421 --> 00:57:54.421
<v Speaker 1>would do that better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't.</v>

992
00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:59.410
<v Speaker 1>That's an Iq test that people who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>count the use faster have hierarchies,</v>

993
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:04.500
<v Speaker 1>almost everything that you would do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would where it has to do with </v>

994
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.550
<v Speaker 1>manipulation of abstractions of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort.</v>

995
00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Even something that basic seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally associated with Iq.</v>

996
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:13.990
<v Speaker 1>People with higher iqs have slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger heads.</v>

997
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 1>If you control for body size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have slightly bigger brains.</v>

998
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:22.440
<v Speaker 1>If you control for body size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the axons on their neurons are a bit </v>

999
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:26.641
<v Speaker 1>thicker so that the electrical messages </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to travel a little bit more </v>

1000
00:58:26.641 --> 00:58:27.250
<v Speaker 1>efficiency efficiently.</v>

1001
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:30.640
<v Speaker 1>They are slightly faster in simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex test,</v>

1002
00:58:30.641 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 1>so it goes right down to the level of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're simple reflex light goes</v>

1003
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:39.481
<v Speaker 1>on pushing buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not many neurons mediating that </v>

1004
00:58:39.481 --> 00:58:39.481
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1005
00:58:39.481 --> 00:58:41.410
<v Speaker 1>chains of neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few neurons communicating</v>

1006
00:58:41.411 --> 00:58:46.411
<v Speaker 1>so that you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even at that relatively simple </v>

1007
00:58:46.411 --> 00:58:48.670
<v Speaker 1>processing level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq is associated with speed,</v>

1008
00:58:48.671 --> 00:58:53.671
<v Speaker 1>so there's a physiological component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're less likely to develop </v>

1009
00:58:53.671 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's disease if you have a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq,</v>

1010
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.100
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's because your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just more robust,</v>

1011
00:58:57.101 --> 00:58:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could sustain damage,</v>

1012
00:58:59.711 --> 00:59:03.220
<v Speaker 1>say up to 50 percent of your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't even show it if you're,</v>

1013
00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:06.550
<v Speaker 1>if you have a sufficiently high Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're,</v>

1014
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:11.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're on the bottom end of the ICU </v>

1015
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:11.650
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're much more,</v>

1016
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:13.660
<v Speaker 1>you seem to be much more susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological damage.</v>

1017
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition is a big predictor of Iq </v>

1018
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:19.130
<v Speaker 1>variation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1019
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of that's been hammered out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern,</v>

1020
00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:24.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 150 years ago,</v>

1021
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:29.770
<v Speaker 1>people's Iq was pretty tightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with their nutritional </v>

1022
00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:29.770
<v Speaker 1>status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now,</v>

1023
00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:31.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very few people in North America</v>

1024
00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:36.280
<v Speaker 1>who don't have enough to eat even though</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some variation in quality of </v>

1025
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.460
<v Speaker 1>diet and that's flattened out a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1026
00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural variability and intelligence.</v>

1027
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a,</v>

1028
00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy named Hemphill,</v>

1029
00:59:51.951 --> 00:59:54.470
<v Speaker 1>did this paper read American </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist a while back,</v>

1030
00:59:54.471 --> 00:59:56.480
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things he was interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in doing,</v>

1031
00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:58.490
<v Speaker 1>remember we talked about effect sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1032
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:02.750
<v Speaker 1>How big is an effect in psychology or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the social sciences in general?</v>

1033
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.320
<v Speaker 1>And people have used rules of thumb that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point five was a moderate effect and </v>

1034
01:00:08.391 --> 01:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>point three was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1035
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.110
<v Speaker 1>a minimal effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And point two was,</v>

1036
01:00:12.111 --> 01:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1037
01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:16.340
<v Speaker 1>starting to diminish to the point of non</v>
<v Speaker 1>utility,</v>

1038
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.820
<v Speaker 1>but what handheld did instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guessing because that was just a guess </v>

1039
01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>was actually go and look at papers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were published in psychology to see what</v>

1040
01:00:24.771 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>effect sizes are being reported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an empirical analysis of how big</v>

1041
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:33.410
<v Speaker 1>the effects that psychologists and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>social scientists report.</v>

1042
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.780
<v Speaker 1>And so what he found was that,</v>

1043
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:37.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1044
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:41.860
<v Speaker 1>the highest third of papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

1045
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>the third of papers that had the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects reported effects from point </v>

1046
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

1047
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>two point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

1048
01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm the middle third from point two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point three,</v>

1049
01:00:50.791 --> 01:00:52.280
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the lower third from point.</v>

1050
01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to two point two.</v>

1051
01:00:53.491 --> 01:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there another?</v>

1052
01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look on the left side here,</v>

1053
01:00:59.191 --> 01:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>you see that and are lasted point one </v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

1054
01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:09.550
<v Speaker 1>characterize as the first quarter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>published studies and R of point one,</v>

1055
01:01:09.631 --> 01:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two point three,</v>

1056
01:01:10.561 --> 01:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next core tile,</v>

1057
01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>so 50 percent of psychological studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>report and are of less than point three,</v>

1058
01:01:18.181 --> 01:01:23.181
<v Speaker 1>five 90 percent report and are of less </v>
<v Speaker 1>than point five and only 78 percent </v>

1059
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>reported our point five or above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that the </v>

1060
01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.991
<v Speaker 1>relationship between Iq and say academic</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance or longterm life income is </v>

1061
01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:43.490
<v Speaker 1>higher than that reported in all but </v>
<v Speaker 1>about five percent of psychology </v>

1062
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1063
01:01:45.781 --> 01:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>So here's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

1064
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:49.520
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1065
01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>in order to determine whether something </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>

1066
01:01:54.061 --> 01:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to measure it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it has to be good for something.</v>

1067
01:01:56.491 --> 01:02:01.491
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be grippable and has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>usable as a tool will save for,</v>

1068
01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:07.010
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of Iq do you need for what </v>

1069
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.600
<v Speaker 1>kind of job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1070
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:12.950
<v Speaker 1>this was derived from a company called </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderlic and wonderlic does employment </v>

1071
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:17.301
<v Speaker 1>testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists usually don't use the </v>

1072
01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>wonderlic test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a relatively short Iq test and it's</v>

1073
01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:22.401
<v Speaker 1>a good test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think don't use it because it was </v>

1074
01:02:22.401 --> 01:02:25.401
<v Speaker 1>developed commercially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we tested the wonderlic out a lot </v>

1075
01:02:25.401 --> 01:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>and it has excellent psychometric </v>
<v Speaker 1>properties.</v>

1076
01:02:25.711 --> 01:02:30.711
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good Iq testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably airs a little bit in testing </v>

1077
01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:36.951
<v Speaker 1>crystallized Iq rather than fluid Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we won't argue about that for the </v>

1078
01:02:36.951 --> 01:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>time being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1079
01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:43.221
<v Speaker 1>so if you have an Iq from 130,</v>
<v Speaker 1>116 to 130,</v>

1080
01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>that puts you in the [inaudible] 86 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>95th percentile.</v>

1081
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means you're minimally.</v>

1082
01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>If there were eight people in a room on </v>
<v Speaker 1>average,</v>

1083
01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>you'd be the smartest person.</v>

1084
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:54.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1085
01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I should tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know that</v>

1086
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:05.450
<v Speaker 1>if you're a state college students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use the US as an example because </v>

1087
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:09.831
<v Speaker 1>there's more differentiation between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American universities in terms of </v>

1088
01:03:09.831 --> 01:03:10.500
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there is the Canadian universities,</v>

1089
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:17.030
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in an average American </v>

1090
01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:18.720
<v Speaker 1>postsecondary institution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Iq is 115,</v>

1091
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:23.460
<v Speaker 1>and so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think that's not all that bright,</v>

1092
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.480
<v Speaker 1>but that's brighter than seven out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight people in the general population,</v>

1093
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:36.590
<v Speaker 1>and so there are as many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the North American </v>

1094
01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:39.951
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have the 50th percentile in the </v>

1095
01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.960
<v Speaker 1>middle of the normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the 85th percentile here and </v>

1096
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.791
<v Speaker 1>you have the 15th percentile here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 70 percent of people fall </v>

1097
01:03:46.791 --> 01:03:50.781
<v Speaker 1>between the 15th and the 85th percentile</v>
<v Speaker 1>or right at the 50th percentile.</v>

1098
01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:55.860
<v Speaker 1>You're not really very literate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what that means is that in the </v>

1099
01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:00.980
<v Speaker 1>United States there's just as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who aren't literate as there are </v>

1100
01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:04.341
<v Speaker 1>people who are in college and what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would mean by literate is not so much </v>

1101
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:08.850
<v Speaker 1>like here's a bare bones definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>literate.</v>

1102
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:14.310
<v Speaker 1>You could follow written instructions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what that means is it's kind of a</v>

1103
01:04:14.311 --> 01:04:15.960
<v Speaker 1>twofold issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1104
01:04:15.961 --> 01:04:20.961
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make out the words and the </v>

1105
01:04:20.961 --> 01:04:22.671
<v Speaker 1>phrases and the sentences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you can translate them into </v>

1106
01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:26.931
<v Speaker 1>actual action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use them as information and an </v>

1107
01:04:26.931 --> 01:04:27.690
<v Speaker 1>85 you're going to have not a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>time doing that,</v>

1108
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.440
<v Speaker 1>and so when you're wondering things </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the way society is structured and </v>

1109
01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:38.421
<v Speaker 1>white people are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily make the most </v>

1110
01:04:38.431 --> 01:04:43.431
<v Speaker 1>intellectually sophisticated choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that's very much worth </v>

1111
01:04:43.431 --> 01:04:47.181
<v Speaker 1>remembering is that there's just as many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are functionally illiterate </v>

1112
01:04:47.181 --> 01:04:47.910
<v Speaker 1>in North America as there are people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in,</v>

1113
01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tier one colleges.</v>

1114
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:52.980
<v Speaker 1>It's quite shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

1115
01:04:52.981 --> 01:04:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you want to be an attorney,</v>

1116
01:04:54.631 --> 01:04:57.570
<v Speaker 1>a research analyst and editor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising manager,</v>

1117
01:04:57.571 --> 01:04:58.920
<v Speaker 1>a chemist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an engineer,</v>

1118
01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.950
<v Speaker 1>and executive assistance analyst and </v>
<v Speaker 1>auditor.</v>

1119
01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:04.380
<v Speaker 1>So you're up in the professional levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1120
01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:10.400
<v Speaker 1>You need an ICU of at least 116 and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>130 would be better.</v>

1121
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.570
<v Speaker 1>My suspicions are that the average Iq of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in this room is about 1:20</v>

1122
01:05:15.571 --> 01:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>to 1:25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be a little higher than that.</v>

1123
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:24.420
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to measure Iq in the ute </v>
<v Speaker 1>population because a lot of people have </v>

1124
01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>English as a second language and so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it harder to,</v>

1125
01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to measure crystallized </v>

1126
01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:33.271
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously using an English language </v>

1127
01:05:33.271 --> 01:05:35.401
<v Speaker 1>test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's we found when we've done our </v>

1128
01:05:35.401 --> 01:05:37.560
<v Speaker 1>studies at the uft that the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceeds 1:20,</v>

1129
01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.920
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you guys have the cognitive power to </v>

1130
01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>basically pursue professional level </v>
<v Speaker 1>careers,</v>

1131
01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from 1:10</v>

1132
01:05:47.741 --> 01:05:50.720
<v Speaker 1>to 1:15</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager,</v>

1133
01:05:50.721 --> 01:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>supervisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>programmer,</v>

1134
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:54.490
<v Speaker 1>teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>general manager,</v>

1135
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:59.910
<v Speaker 1>purchasing agent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>registered nurse sales account </v>

1136
01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:02.401
<v Speaker 1>executive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are actually empirically derived </v>

1137
01:06:02.401 --> 01:06:05.070
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the wonderlic company has tested a </v>

1138
01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:07.860
<v Speaker 1>very large number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these are the actual averages of </v>

1139
01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:09.700
<v Speaker 1>the professions that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>

1140
01:06:09.701 --> 01:06:10.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not hypothetical</v>

1141
01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.620
<v Speaker 1>108 to 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three to 108.</v>

1142
01:06:22.621 --> 01:06:25.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's the 60 to the 70th percentile </v>
<v Speaker 1>clerk,</v>

1143
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.470
<v Speaker 1>customer service Rep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer operator,</v>

1144
01:06:28.471 --> 01:06:31.170
<v Speaker 1>medical debt collector secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accounting clerk,</v>

1145
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.350
<v Speaker 1>general sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telephone sales assistant manager,</v>

1146
01:06:34.351 --> 01:06:35.610
<v Speaker 1>credit clerk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drafter,</v>

1147
01:06:35.611 --> 01:06:36.810
<v Speaker 1>designer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bookkeeper.</v>

1148
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of white color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like low level entry level white collar </v>

1149
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:47.301
<v Speaker 1>jobs in that particular category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the brighter people </v>

1150
01:06:48.841 --> 01:06:52.080
<v Speaker 1>among the high school students who </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't go to college.</v>

1151
01:06:52.081 --> 01:06:57.081
<v Speaker 1>And University Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is dead average 50th to the 55th </v>

1152
01:06:57.081 --> 01:06:58.860
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Police officer,</v>

1153
01:06:58.861 --> 01:07:00.330
<v Speaker 1>receptionist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cashier,</v>

1154
01:07:00.331 --> 01:07:03.300
<v Speaker 1>general clerical staff inside sales </v>
<v Speaker 1>clerk,</v>

1155
01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.850
<v Speaker 1>meter reader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>printer teller,</v>

1156
01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.400
<v Speaker 1>data entry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical helper,</v>

1157
01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.500
<v Speaker 1>dispatcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and general office.</v>

1158
01:07:10.501 --> 01:07:15.501
<v Speaker 1>So that's right at 195 to 98.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the 42nd to the 45th </v>

1159
01:07:16.801 --> 01:07:19.590
<v Speaker 1>percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quality Control Checker,</v>

1160
01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.440
<v Speaker 1>claims clerk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>security guard or unskilled labor.</v>

1161
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:25.710
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unskilled laborers are up at 95th to</v>

1162
01:07:25.711 --> 01:07:26.580
<v Speaker 1>98.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1163
01:07:26.581 --> 01:07:31.581
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still at the unskilled labor </v>

1164
01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:35.391
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still have an Iq that's higher </v>

1165
01:07:35.391 --> 01:07:35.391
<v Speaker 1>than 40 percent of the population.</v>

1166
01:07:35.391 --> 01:07:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Arc Welder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diasend or mechanic medical,</v>

1167
01:07:37.351 --> 01:07:42.351
<v Speaker 1>dental assistant Iq 87 to 93 messenger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>factory production worker Assembler,</v>

1168
01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:46.920
<v Speaker 1>food service worker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurses aid,</v>

1169
01:07:46.921 --> 01:07:48.180
<v Speaker 1>warehouseman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>custodian,</v>

1170
01:07:48.181 --> 01:07:50.790
<v Speaker 1>janitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>material handler and packer.</v>

1171
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now what you see happening,</v>

1172
01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:56.370
<v Speaker 1>the difference that it looks to me like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do job,</v>

1173
01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:01.520
<v Speaker 1>you can conceptualize jobs most simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a two by two matrix.</v>

1174
01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's managerial,</v>

1175
01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:08.010
<v Speaker 1>administrative jobs and creative jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first one.</v>

1176
01:08:08.011 --> 01:08:13.011
<v Speaker 1>And then there's low complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>High complexity and so what you're </v>

1177
01:08:13.011 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>starting to fall into the 21st to the 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile,</v>

1178
01:08:15.981 --> 01:08:20.981
<v Speaker 1>so that's still one person in three are </v>
<v Speaker 1>low complexity managerial jobs and so </v>

1179
01:08:21.141 --> 01:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>what I mean by that is that if you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a low complexity job,</v>

1180
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're responsible for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1181
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>but roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same 30 things all the time and</v>

1182
01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:36.401
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be taken care of the same </v>

1183
01:08:36.401 --> 01:08:39.251
<v Speaker 1>way each time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a finite domain of </v>

1184
01:08:39.251 --> 01:08:42.341
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and you can master it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq will predict how fast you master it.</v>

1185
01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.710
<v Speaker 1>But once you master it will predict how </v>
<v Speaker 1>well you do.</v>

1186
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:49.640
<v Speaker 1>What happens then in all likelihood is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that conscientiousness starts to predict</v>

1187
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:54.320
<v Speaker 1>or maybe emotional stability starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict or some of the other personality</v>

1188
01:08:54.321 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 1>factors start to become more important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So but at 87 to 93,</v>

1189
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 1>you're down at the level of custodian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and janitor.</v>

1190
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And then that's that and that's not so </v>
<v Speaker 1>good because you have the bottom 15 to </v>

1191
01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:14.710
<v Speaker 1>20 percent of the population who aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite,</v>

1192
01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:18.980
<v Speaker 1>who haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't have cognitive ability at that</v>

1193
01:09:18.981 --> 01:09:23.981
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you're </v>

1194
01:09:23.981 --> 01:09:25.721
<v Speaker 1>going to hear a lot about as you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>older is reasons for unemployment and </v>

1195
01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:32.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the prime reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment in the future is </v>

1196
01:09:32.230 --> 01:09:34.661
<v Speaker 1>increasingly going to be that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just nothing for someone of that level </v>

1197
01:09:34.661 --> 01:09:38.861
<v Speaker 1>of intelligence to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is partly why people hate icu </v>

1198
01:09:38.861 --> 01:09:41.180
<v Speaker 1>because you think that is a nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty thing to conclude.</v>

1199
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a client at one point who,</v>

1200
01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:50.801
<v Speaker 1>I suspect he had a verbal Iq of about 85</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a nonverbal Iq that was lower.</v>

1201
01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had other psychological issues,</v>

1202
01:09:54.711 --> 01:09:59.711
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll just concentrate on that one </v>

1203
01:09:59.711 --> 01:09:59.711
<v Speaker 1>for the time being.</v>

1204
01:09:59.711 --> 01:10:04.190
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a hard time finding a job.</v>

1205
01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:06.710
<v Speaker 1>He was socially anxious and that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>

1206
01:10:06.711 --> 01:10:09.350
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if he could overcome that,</v>

1207
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:14.830
<v Speaker 1>it was very difficult for him to master </v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic skills that were involved in </v>

1208
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:17.600
<v Speaker 1>what you would consider even relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward tasks.</v>

1209
01:10:17.601 --> 01:10:20.630
<v Speaker 1>So I spent a lot of time trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a job,</v>

1210
01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:23.510
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was insanely difficult.</v>

1211
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:27.050
<v Speaker 1>He went to the government first to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>help and they told him to,</v>

1212
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:32.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>type up his resume on a computer and </v>

1213
01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:32.890
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1214
01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:36.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't very helpful because he </v>

1215
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:36.400
<v Speaker 1>didn't know how to use a computer and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't gonna type up his damn resume and</v>

1216
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was if you want to get a job,</v>

1217
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:42.590
<v Speaker 1>go out and do the things that it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>take to get a job while yeah,</v>

1218
01:10:42.591 --> 01:10:44.630
<v Speaker 1>if you can do that then you don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1219
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.140
<v Speaker 1>And so the government agencies were </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely useless,</v>

1220
01:10:48.141 --> 01:10:53.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were staffed by people who </v>

1221
01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:53.141
<v Speaker 1>would assume that if you didn't do what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were advised to,</v>

1222
01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:57.821
<v Speaker 1>that you just didn't want to have a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of ever thinking that maybe you </v>

1223
01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:58.610
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy to use a computer.</v>

1224
01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:04.780
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I tried to get him a volunteer </v>

1225
01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.381
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you can bloody well forget about </v>

1226
01:11:08.381 --> 01:11:10.481
<v Speaker 1>that because it's harder to get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>volunteer job than it is to get a real </v>

1227
01:11:10.481 --> 01:11:10.910
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that you have</v>

1228
01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:13.530
<v Speaker 1>to step through a number of complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucratic hoops,</v>

1229
01:11:13.890 --> 01:11:16.500
<v Speaker 1>including having police check and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1230
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:21.620
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's intimidating as hell for people </v>

1231
01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:21.620
<v Speaker 1>even if they haven't done anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1232
01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.710
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that straightforward.</v>

1233
01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:27.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it involves maneuvering through a </v>

1234
01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:28.260
<v Speaker 1>complicated bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the only step.</v>

1235
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:30.900
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of other steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So volunteer work,</v>

1236
01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:31.740
<v Speaker 1>that's out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1237
01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not gonna happen.</v>

1238
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Not generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I found him a job helping a guy</v>

1239
01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:42.240
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a bicycle shop slash bookstore.</v>

1240
01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:47.440
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of a strange combination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a government subsidized </v>

1241
01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.210
<v Speaker 1>temporary position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he did a good job at it.</v>

1242
01:11:48.211 --> 01:11:48.630
<v Speaker 1>He could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1243
01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:50.790
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was reshelving books and that sort of</v>

1244
01:11:50.791 --> 01:11:55.791
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he was reliable and he could do </v>

1245
01:11:55.791 --> 01:11:55.791
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1246
01:11:55.791 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 1>the subsidy program ended in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1247
01:11:56.851 --> 01:12:01.851
<v Speaker 1>if you run a bike shop slash bookstore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you have additional money </v>

1248
01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:02.550
<v Speaker 1>to hire someone because you know those </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

1249
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 1>That's a store that's just not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be generating maybe any income,</v>

1250
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:07.920
<v Speaker 1>but certainly not enough to hire </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

1251
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:10.920
<v Speaker 1>So that fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I,</v>

1252
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I did a bunch of con.</v>

1253
01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I did made a bunch of personal contacts </v>
<v Speaker 1>with charity organizations to see if I </v>

1254
01:12:17.971 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>can get them a volunteer position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally got him a volunteer position,</v>

1255
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:24.630
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went with him to train him at</v>

1256
01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:27.120
<v Speaker 1>the volunteer position and that was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightening.</v>

1257
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.720
<v Speaker 1>So what he had to do was he had a stack </v>
<v Speaker 1>of pieces of paper here and then a stack</v>

1258
01:12:35.011 --> 01:12:40.011
<v Speaker 1>of envelopes here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in principle the pieces of paper </v>

1259
01:12:40.011 --> 01:12:42.330
<v Speaker 1>which were letters were in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>order as the envelopes work.</v>

1260
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:46.230
<v Speaker 1>And so what he had to do was fold the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces of paper three times and stuff,</v>

1261
01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:51.231
<v Speaker 1>the folded piece of paper into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>envelope and then seal the envelope and </v>

1262
01:12:51.231 --> 01:12:54.531
<v Speaker 1>then put it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a bit more complicated than </v>

1263
01:12:54.531 --> 01:12:57.711
<v Speaker 1>that because sometimes the letters were </v>
<v Speaker 1>French and sometimes they were in </v>

1264
01:12:57.711 --> 01:13:01.821
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that meant was that he had to </v>

1265
01:13:01.821 --> 01:13:04.270
<v Speaker 1>watch and see that the French envelopes </v>
<v Speaker 1>went into this stack and the English and</v>

1266
01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:05.670
<v Speaker 1>envelopes went into that stock.</v>

1267
01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:07.710
<v Speaker 1>So that's one degree of complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1268
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:13.310
<v Speaker 1>But then it also turned out that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn envelopes had to be run through an </v>

1269
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:14.730
<v Speaker 1>automatic letter sorting machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think,</v>

1270
01:13:14.731 --> 01:13:19.731
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does matter because those things </v>

1271
01:13:19.731 --> 01:13:22.551
<v Speaker 1>have very tightly defined tolerances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you make a mistake,</v>

1272
01:13:25.561 --> 01:13:28.680
<v Speaker 1>imagine you fold the piece of paper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time you fold it,</v>

1273
01:13:28.681 --> 01:13:30.660
<v Speaker 1>you made a mistake of an eighth of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inch.</v>

1274
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:36.140
<v Speaker 1>And then the next time you fold it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make another eighth of an inch </v>

1275
01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.530
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means your piece of papers now one </v>

1276
01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:40.731
<v Speaker 1>quarter inch out of true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you stuff it in the envelope </v>

1277
01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:43.320
<v Speaker 1>and folded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you crinkled the envelope.</v>

1278
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:47.850
<v Speaker 1>And so then the envelope gets stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the automatic processing machines.</v>

1279
01:13:47.851 --> 01:13:52.851
<v Speaker 1>So I taught him probably 20 hours how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fold this piece of paper into three and </v>

1280
01:13:55.170 --> 01:14:00.030
<v Speaker 1>he was a bit shaky and he just didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the motor fine motor ability or the</v>

1281
01:14:00.031 --> 01:14:02.730
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability to do that and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll end with this.</v>

1282
01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:09.170
<v Speaker 1>When he finally couldn't do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was the letters came with </v>

1283
01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:13.581
<v Speaker 1>photographs attached to them and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to fold the pieces of paper around </v>

1284
01:14:13.581 --> 01:14:17.791
<v Speaker 1>the photographs in a way that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumpled the photographs so that they </v>

1285
01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:21.031
<v Speaker 1>could still fit into the envelopes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>each photo was stapled maybe half an </v>

1286
01:14:22.631 --> 01:14:27.631
<v Speaker 1>inch different per piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he had to fold them properly </v>

1287
01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:32.970
<v Speaker 1>with a different folding technique for </v>
<v Speaker 1>every piece of paper and he had to sort </v>

1288
01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:36.511
<v Speaker 1>them into French and English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also if the envelopes and the </v>

1289
01:14:36.511 --> 01:14:37.390
<v Speaker 1>papers ever gone out of sync,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they did now.</v>

1290
01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:42.391
<v Speaker 1>And then he had to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort the envelopes and the pieces of </v>

1291
01:14:42.391 --> 01:14:43.090
<v Speaker 1>paper to make sure that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>matched with the proper.</v>

1292
01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:49.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were matched with the proper </v>

1293
01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:49.140
<v Speaker 1>envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1294
01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:49.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the end of it.</v>

1295
01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll tell you the rest of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>story later.</v>

1296
01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.110
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1297
01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.190
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>

1298
01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.980
<v Speaker 1>The moral of the story is if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart,</v>

1299
01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.740
<v Speaker 1>you're privileged and thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make use of it.</v>

1300
01:15:00.010 --> 01:15:02.410
<v Speaker 1>And if you're on the lower end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ICU distribution,</v>

1301
01:15:02.411 --> 01:15:04.660
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got one tough life ahead of you,</v>

1302
01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:08.020
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work or virtually nothing.</v>

1303
01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:11.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's a good thing to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's horrible.</v>

1304
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:22.910
<v Speaker 3>Entrepreneurial reframing.</v>
