WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're actually going to take a step </v>

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historically,</v>

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>doctor both Carl Rogers last time as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologist,</v>

4
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>so we started our brief foray into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas behind phenomenology,</v>

5
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:25.641
<v Speaker 1>but now we're going to go back in time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and VIP and we're going to talk about </v>

6
00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>the end of the 19th century and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to discuss Nietzsche and </v>

7
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:34.521
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky and character guard in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail and the reason we're going to do </v>

8
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>that is because those three men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

9
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I would say more than anyone else in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>19th century,</v>

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>laid the groundwork not only for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>would become psychoanalysis and then </v>

11
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>later personality psychology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical psychology,</v>

12
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>but they also describe the broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

13
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.830
<v Speaker 1>political and cultural situation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern people find themselves in now and</v>

14
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>their thought is exceedingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and it's really worth </v>

15
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>grasping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you can get it,</v>

16
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>you know we're going through these </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality theories one of the time and</v>

17
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>we're making going to make forays into </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology and neuro psychology.</v>

18
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 1>You need a structure underneath that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to understand a structure </v>

19
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>that's underneath all of that to slot </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything into.</v>

20
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:29.271
<v Speaker 1>Because that way you can understand it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in more detail and so partly because </v>

21
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>ideas develop historically and also as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea,</v>

22
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:39.111
<v Speaker 1>as a seed and the seed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other plants grow and so forth and the </v>

23
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>plant grows and so forth and branches </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

24
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>If you can get back down to the origin </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

25
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>then you can often understand the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure more straightforwardly and </v>

26
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>also these three men are so brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a joy to encounter their </v>

27
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>thinking even though it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very subversive.</v>

28
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Seriously diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna start with this diagram </v>

29
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>which you will remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>

30
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>You're so think about this from the pit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of perspective,</v>

31
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>like we made the point that as the child</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts itself,</v>

32
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>let's say together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts by practicing micro routines,</v>

33
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>micro molder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>routines,</v>

34
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>and those are accompanied by perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>frameworks and also they're incorporated</v>

35
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:33.501
<v Speaker 1>into a motivational value system because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're motivated actions and then the </v>

36
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>child practices sequencing.</v>

37
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Those micro personalities will say </v>
<v Speaker 1>together to make ever more and more </v>

38
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>complex and ever more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated macro personalities.</v>

39
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And so that's basically what this </v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram describes.</v>

40
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>We were looking at it from an adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

41
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>So you know if you're going to be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

42
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.130
<v Speaker 1>you can decompose being a good person </v>
<v Speaker 1>into sub of being a good person and you </v>

43
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.851
<v Speaker 1>can decode it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so being a good person is an abstract </v>

44
00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you move closer and closer to the</v>

45
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>point where the goodness is manifested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in action,</v>

46
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.691
<v Speaker 1>you move closer and closer to actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements in the world and so the </v>

47
00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>abstract category good person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually made out of.</v>

48
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.550
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it as a very complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>melody of motor motor actions and </v>

49
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:28.741
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perception is very tightly linked to </v>

50
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:28.741
<v Speaker 1>motor action because whenever you </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive anything,</v>

51
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it in part by actively </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating world is partly why your </v>

52
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>eyes are moving around all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're listening,</v>

53
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>you move your head and touch something.</v>

54
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
<v Speaker 1>You have to actively investigate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's always an activity of </v>

55
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.761
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in some ways when you think about </v>

56
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>the child piecing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

57
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>It's being together from the bottom up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about that as a biological</v>

58
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>process unfolding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

59
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>and you can take up the child is </v>
<v Speaker 1>crawling and then learning to walk as a </v>

60
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>biological process unfolding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's an oversimplification because</v>

61
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>human beings exist from day one in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

62
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:12.061
<v Speaker 1>very social world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is the way that </v>

63
00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:16.261
<v Speaker 1>those behaviors are sub micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities start to organize </v>

64
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:18.990
<v Speaker 1>themselves is always under the influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

65
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>of the society in which they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded.</v>

66
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Piaget talked about the child as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

68
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>as being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.530
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as having reflex basic built in reflex </v>

70
00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:37.970
<v Speaker 1>is at birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

71
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.020
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those reflexes are then elaborated up </v>

72
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.020
<v Speaker 1>into more and more complex structures.</v>

73
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>But you can think that even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaboration of those basic reflexes,</v>

74
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:49.501
<v Speaker 1>even right from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a routing and sucking </v>

75
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:49.501
<v Speaker 1>reflex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can,</v>

76
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>you can listen from a child by tapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side of it's cheap when it's very</v>

77
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:57.031
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>newly born and it'll search to try to </v>

78
00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:57.031
<v Speaker 1>put what's tapping in its mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

79
00:04:57.031 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the reflection process.</v>

80
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:05.401
<v Speaker 1>The built in perceptual motor unit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows the child to begin to cycle.</v>

81
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it suckling isn't a static and </v>

82
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.090
<v Speaker 1>objective entity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a person and part of breastfeeding </v>

83
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>is the establishment of a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complex relationship,</v>

84
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 1>because it's also not only a feeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

85
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:24.241
<v Speaker 1>it's a caring relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a relationship that's based on </v>

86
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>tactile interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There can be nervousness associated with</v>

87
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

88
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and often is,</v>

89
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>especially for a new mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complex,</v>

90
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>dynamic social act.</v>

91
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning,</v>

92
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>in order for the baby to engage in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>process properly,</v>

93
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.300
<v Speaker 1>it has to allow its initial reflexive </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements to be modified by social </v>

94
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>necessity immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

95
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>if a baby is breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't bite and you know,</v>

96
00:05:55.421 --> 00:06:00.421
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have any teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So being isn't necessarily a </v>

97
00:06:00.421 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not pleasant.</v>

98
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>And so what will happen if the baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>bites the mother is that the mother will</v>

99
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>pull away and startle the baby and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby will cry and you know,</v>

100
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>the father will be at least startled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

101
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.700
<v Speaker 1>by the error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the baby has to learn to you.</v>

102
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>It has to learn to be civilized in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

103
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:23.111
<v Speaker 1>Right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know when Freud was talking </v>

104
00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:25.571
<v Speaker 1>about the process of socialization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tended to concentrate more on toilet </v>

105
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

106
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he thought of that as the first </v>

107
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 1>place were the first major place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ID of the child,</v>

108
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:37.241
<v Speaker 1>which which or which Rogers would regard</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an organismic as the organismic.</v>

109
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.600
<v Speaker 1>A experiential domain is brought under </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the superego.</v>

110
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the baby.</v>

111
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's fundamental biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>function is to relieve itself,</v>

112
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.720
<v Speaker 1>but that has to come under very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strict social control and it's a.</v>

113
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a complex form of learning which </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the acquisition of voluntary </v>

114
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 1>control over what was here too for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>involuntary reflex essentially,</v>

115
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.830
<v Speaker 1>and so that can go well or it can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly and it can very well go very </v>

116
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I knew a family who had a daughter at</v>

117
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:16.301
<v Speaker 1>one point and that daughter would only </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicate in her diaper when she was </v>

118
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:20.831
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that meant she had full of voluntary </v>

119
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:23.081
<v Speaker 1>control of her bowel function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was no way she was going to </v>

120
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>participate in the social ritual that </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded proper toilet.</v>

121
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 1>There was a war going on like a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>war and that sort of thing happens while</v>

122
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:36.341
<v Speaker 1>not infrequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course you remember in the crumb </v>

123
00:07:36.341 --> 00:07:36.341
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother,</v>

124
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.130
<v Speaker 1>the boys accusing the mother of giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>them enemas and her of course denying </v>

125
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.451
<v Speaker 1>that any such thing happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was something that made both of </v>

126
00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:46.451
<v Speaker 1>them roll their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:50.470
<v Speaker 1>and they all laughed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really not particularly </v>

128
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 1>amusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

129
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Speaker 1>my point is is that even at the micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

130
00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:00.310
<v Speaker 1>the manifestation of what we'll call </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro personalities expands and </v>

131
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 1>organizes into an environment that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioned by social expectation.</v>

132
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then then,</v>

133
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 1>and this is something we haven't talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about before,</v>

134
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 1>one thing you might ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

135
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>where does the social expectation come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>

136
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a very complex question </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense that's the same </v>

137
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 1>question as that as where does culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from?</v>

138
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:29.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly a complex question </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to take into account </v>

139
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:34.120
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history which provides the </v>
<v Speaker 1>substrata for the development of </v>

140
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.921
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be human biology of take </v>

141
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>that into account and then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take human history into account and,</v>

142
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.220
<v Speaker 1>and we're what you don't have to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>into account is not clear,</v>

143
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very difficult to,</v>

144
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 1>to track the origins of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>routines that make up the fundamental </v>

145
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:52.360
<v Speaker 1>social contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

146
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 1>we know how to behave properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>

147
00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.680
<v Speaker 1>We have a set of expectations and a set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of wants for about the way that other </v>

148
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>people are going to behave with regards </v>
<v Speaker 1>to us.</v>

149
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 1>And they returned the favor and everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>is participating in this and everybody </v>

150
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.490
<v Speaker 1>basically knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they're very poorly socialized,</v>

151
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 1>you can usually tell that right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

152
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.970
<v Speaker 1>kids can tell that because if a three </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old is playing with another three </v>

153
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.421
<v Speaker 1>year old and one of them is poorly </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialized and so maybe has the </v>

154
00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:21.930
<v Speaker 1>behavioral repertoire of a fairly badly </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaved two year old.</v>

155
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 1>The other three year old being socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated will say,</v>

156
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:30.590
<v Speaker 1>will not play with the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even though they might be perfectly </v>

157
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.750
<v Speaker 1>happy to play for a time with an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>two year old,</v>

158
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.270
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't take very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really about the age of three.</v>

159
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.370
<v Speaker 1>The children are already sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to have embodied the rules that </v>

160
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:48.591
<v Speaker 1>constitute appropriate cultural behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those rules are there patterns </v>

161
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:53.901
<v Speaker 1>actually for the exactly rules for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child because the child couldn't </v>

162
00:09:53.901 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 1>explicitly state them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can act them out.</v>

163
00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget talked about this a fair bit,</v>

164
00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:03.381
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he said that part of the way </v>

165
00:10:03.381 --> 00:10:06.351
<v Speaker 1>that the slightly larger micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality say have a two year old are </v>

166
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
<v Speaker 1>integrated into the broader social world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is through games that are played with </v>

167
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.560
<v Speaker 1>peers and with older children and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>games are ways that like a game is </v>

168
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.880
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally a negotiated.</v>

169
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a negotiated sphere of action and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception that has a particular goal </v>

170
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.950
<v Speaker 1>and the goal is defined by the players </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sphere of interaction is defined</v>

171
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 1>by the players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then if you're a good player,</v>

172
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:39.051
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that you become part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a higher order structure and the </v>

173
00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy structure is the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're playing soccer,</v>

174
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:46.250
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden if you're civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you manifest those </v>

175
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.731
<v Speaker 1>behaviors that are appropriate to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer and you subordinate your </v>

176
00:10:49.731 --> 00:10:54.501
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily subordinate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your individuality at that point to the </v>

177
00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 1>higher order structure of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a communal agreement.</v>

178
00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:01.791
<v Speaker 1>So it's a basic social contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you practice being part of basic </v>

179
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:07.191
<v Speaker 1>social contracts by playing games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can do that with games that are </v>

180
00:11:07.191 --> 00:11:11.450
<v Speaker 1>in some sense relatively straightforward</v>
<v Speaker 1>and regulated by strict conventions and </v>

181
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:17.991
<v Speaker 1>articulated rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be like a soccer game </v>

182
00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:19.650
<v Speaker 1>or you can do it in a more complex way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a less,</v>

183
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.920
<v Speaker 1>a less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a less structured and less articulated </v>

184
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>manner by engaging in dramatic play.</v>

185
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Speaker 1>And so what children usually do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing that is that they'll </v>

186
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Speaker 1>gather around a little group and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

187
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 1>they'll lay out the drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So drama would be,</v>

188
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:40.380
<v Speaker 1>we're going to simulate x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to simulate a family.</v>

189
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:46.250
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody is assigned a role </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're supposed to act out your </v>

190
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.941
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but exactly how you're supposed to act </v>

191
00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:52.551
<v Speaker 1>it out is left open during the games so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can riff and improvise and basically</v>

192
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:58.801
<v Speaker 1>what children are doing when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that is acting out the family and </v>

193
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:04.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they need to get the family in </v>

194
00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:06.151
<v Speaker 1>their bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because being a parent isn't a set of </v>

195
00:12:06.151 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 1>ideas about parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a set of behaviors.</v>

196
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a dance that you learn to have with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your children and with your partner.</v>

197
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's very complicated and the rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>go far beyond what you could ever </v>

198
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.100
<v Speaker 1>articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

199
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 1>because you can ask yourself a question </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

200
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how should you discipline a child?</v>

201
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

202
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you can argue about that forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but second of all,</v>

203
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you cannot actually elaborate a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles that will guide your behavior</v>

204
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:36.091
<v Speaker 1>in every situation where a child is </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to disrupt the social </v>

205
00:12:36.091 --> 00:12:39.751
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be smarter than you can </v>

206
00:12:39.751 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 1>say in order to be good at doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something as complicated as disciplining</v>

207
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:42.860
<v Speaker 1>a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

208
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>because discipline also means </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging,</v>

209
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's part of discipline as well,</v>

210
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't do those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another part of it is you should </v>

211
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.411
<v Speaker 1>definitely do more of those things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's the inculcation of a moral code </v>

212
00:12:55.421 --> 00:13:00.421
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of that's done through </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal behavior and through providing</v>

213
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:06.181
<v Speaker 1>a role model for spontaneous invitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of things that aren't </v>

214
00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:07.390
<v Speaker 1>verbal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

215
00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

216
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 1>so piaget talked about the game and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take the games become more and</v>

217
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:19.951
<v Speaker 1>more complex and more and more abstract </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more and more like real life as you </v>

218
00:13:19.951 --> 00:13:21.450
<v Speaker 1>mature until they.</v>

219
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:26.530
<v Speaker 1>They may be the games transform into </v>
<v Speaker 1>what sociologists would refer to as </v>

220
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.580
<v Speaker 1>roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the role you're playing at the moment</v>

221
00:13:28.581 --> 00:13:33.581
<v Speaker 1>that at least in principle is student </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know it's a game and it's a game</v>

222
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:36.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's a fiction in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dramatic fiction in some sense.</v>

224
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:44.701
<v Speaker 1>The only reason that it exists as a role</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because society is structured in such</v>

225
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:50.401
<v Speaker 1>a way that enables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This too enables you to do what you're </v>

226
00:13:50.401 --> 00:13:52.990
<v Speaker 1>doing and to live at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not exactly how to outpatient to</v>

227
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:55.810
<v Speaker 1>the normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the natural world in any sense of the</v>

228
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.020
<v Speaker 1>in any sense of the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

229
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:04.230
<v Speaker 1>it's also real life or maybe it's almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>as close to real life as you ever get </v>

230
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.190
<v Speaker 1>because almost everything that modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do,</v>

231
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.890
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is true for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the past,</v>

232
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.820
<v Speaker 1>his game like in its structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the game's just get more and more and</v>

233
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

234
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 1>There's more and more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>encompassing in some sense.</v>

235
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:18.940
<v Speaker 1>But you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can almost.</v>

236
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
<v Speaker 1>You can almost say that it never comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where what you're doing is </v>

237
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.511
<v Speaker 1>no longer playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a bit of an </v>

238
00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 1>oversimplification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because there are games and games,</v>

239
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:30.880
<v Speaker 1>but we won't talk about the games at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

240
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you can understand sort of some </v>

241
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.860
<v Speaker 1>of the lower order games and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>even understand some of the higher order</v>

242
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

243
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.570
<v Speaker 1>you could basically articulate in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense what it means to be a student.</v>

244
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.190
<v Speaker 1>But if you go up the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

245
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:51.360
<v Speaker 1>because good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a subset of good person could be good </v>

246
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:51.560
<v Speaker 1>student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of articulate what it means</v>

247
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 1>to be a good student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you can't fully articulate it,</v>

248
00:14:55.370 --> 00:15:00.370
<v Speaker 1>but if you go at levels above that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like be a good citizen or be a good </v>

249
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:05.141
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but gets more and more difficult to </v>

250
00:15:05.141 --> 00:15:07.331
<v Speaker 1>fully articulate because of course it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more abstract and in </v>

251
00:15:07.331 --> 00:15:11.161
<v Speaker 1>encompasses more and more territory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so by the time you're at the top of the </v>

252
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.620
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

253
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.090
<v Speaker 1>be a good person.</v>

254
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much.</v>

255
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a much more complex phenomena than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can articulate.</v>

256
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:24.070
<v Speaker 1>It can't be fully articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to read you something that </v>

257
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said.</v>

258
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to listen to this carefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's some very interesting </v>

259
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.950
<v Speaker 1>things about the way nature writes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's writes a for forest,</v>

260
00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 1>an need for Islam is a short statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often only a sentence,</v>

261
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 1>but more typically a paragraph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>

262
00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:08.291
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very densely packed with ideas and I </v>

263
00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:10.170
<v Speaker 1>think you could say in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read Nietzsche,</v>

264
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:15.230
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that I'm going to read right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now is from beyond good and evil that </v>

265
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:19.061
<v Speaker 1>every single sentence has an idea in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's often an original idea and </v>

266
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 1>that's a remarkable accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've often gone through books and</v>

267
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:27.911
<v Speaker 1>marked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually fold the top of the page over </v>

268
00:16:27.911 --> 00:16:28.760
<v Speaker 1>mark where I think there is an idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth keeping.</v>

269
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 1>It's an idea I haven't run into before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an original idea and I would say</v>

270
00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 1>in a typical book I read there's none of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

271
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.730
<v Speaker 1>There might be one or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with nature there's probably 20 on a</v>

272
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:43.690
<v Speaker 1>page and so it makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

273
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

274
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.470
<v Speaker 1>He's packed a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information into a very,</v>

275
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:53.471
<v Speaker 1>very small space and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he tried to do that and there was a </v>

276
00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:55.280
<v Speaker 1>bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was his health wasn't very good,</v>

277
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.820
<v Speaker 1>although he was an early stage genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a full professor in Germany,</v>

278
00:16:58.821 --> 00:17:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I think when he was 22 or 23,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is impossible because if you don't</v>

279
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:07.751
<v Speaker 1>become a full professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially 130 years ago,</v>

280
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.020
<v Speaker 1>140 years ago in a German University at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of 23,</v>

281
00:17:13.021 --> 00:17:15.770
<v Speaker 1>it just isn't possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a spectacular genius,</v>

282
00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:20.771
<v Speaker 1>but his health failed him and so he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very difficult time writing and so </v>

283
00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:24.530
<v Speaker 1>what he did was spending an awful lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time thinking and a very short period of</v>

284
00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 1>time writing.</v>

285
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.910
<v Speaker 1>And so what that meant was that he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a tremendous amount of thought,</v>

286
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.940
<v Speaker 1>genius level thought and then compress </v>
<v Speaker 1>it into like a single sentence or a </v>

287
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.081
<v Speaker 1>single paragraph in and he said that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked to philosophize with a hammer and </v>

288
00:17:38.081 --> 00:17:42.941
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know now you know about hierarchy </v>

289
00:17:42.941 --> 00:17:42.941
<v Speaker 1>that I just showed you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

290
00:17:42.941 --> 00:17:47.680
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the idea that if you hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>something disruptive in your life,</v>

291
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:53.230
<v Speaker 1>that the magnitude of your response is </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportionate to the,</v>

292
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.070
<v Speaker 1>to the elevation of the level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

293
00:17:56.071 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It's much more damaging to be accused of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a bad person.</v>

294
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

295
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.570
<v Speaker 1>than it is for someone to complain </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

296
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.500
<v Speaker 1>you know which side of the plate you </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to put the forecourt.</v>

297
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.930
<v Speaker 1>So and I think you can say that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of think of those nested </v>

298
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.280
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies of value as nested </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies of.</v>

299
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 1>They're almost like maps in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>there their little units of things,</v>

300
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:24.660
<v Speaker 1>ways that you know how to maneuver in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and not in.</v>

301
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that as you go up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

302
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.600
<v Speaker 1>the map is larger and larger and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive and so if you blow out </v>

303
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.700
<v Speaker 1>someone's map of which fork to put on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the table,</v>

304
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:38.830
<v Speaker 1>that's not so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can just rectify that in no time </v>

305
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:39.660
<v Speaker 1>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It leaves 99 point nine,</v>

306
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.890
<v Speaker 1>nine percent of their personality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tech.</v>

307
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:46.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you fail a crucial exam for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

308
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:51.171
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fit your a student is because you </v>

309
00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:54.321
<v Speaker 1>want to go to medical school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that'll blow out like 50 or 60 </v>

310
00:18:54.321 --> 00:18:55.380
<v Speaker 1>percent of your personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or at least it'll feel that way.</v>

311
00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's because what's happening is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the structure that you use to </v>

312
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.911
<v Speaker 1>regulate the relationship between you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the world has become damaged at a </v>

313
00:19:04.911 --> 00:19:05.340
<v Speaker 1>high level.</v>

314
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And that invalidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're not a student,</v>

315
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 1>if you're not a good student anymore </v>
<v Speaker 1>than all of the sub factors that make up</v>

316
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:16.030
<v Speaker 1>being a good student might be invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

317
00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.570
<v Speaker 1>you might've put a lot of effort into </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a good student.</v>

318
00:19:18.571 --> 00:19:20.640
<v Speaker 1>And so if all of a sudden you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

319
00:19:20.641 --> 00:19:22.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

320
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.550
<v Speaker 1>what exactly am I and where are all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>errors?</v>

321
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be a,</v>

322
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.200
<v Speaker 1>well that's an extraordinary difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive problem because you've built </v>

323
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 1>that structure who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

324
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:39.390
<v Speaker 1>over what period of time it might be 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years or something like that.</v>

325
00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:44.391
<v Speaker 1>And you'd be practicing building that </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and it's a huge part of your </v>

326
00:19:44.391 --> 00:19:45.120
<v Speaker 1>identity because someone might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

327
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.400
<v Speaker 1>what are you even?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd say a student,</v>

328
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might say,</v>

329
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:50.910
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they could easily say,</v>

330
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:51.570
<v Speaker 1>what are you?</v>

331
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm a student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While if you're not a student at least </v>

332
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 1>in so far as you desire to find student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just exactly what are you.</v>

333
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.240
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So nature,</v>

334
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:05.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he packed a lot of information into</v>

335
00:20:05.401 --> 00:20:10.401
<v Speaker 1>a sentence or a paragraph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be very careful reading him </v>

336
00:20:10.401 --> 00:20:13.531
<v Speaker 1>and young is like this too because he'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw some information if you that's </v>

337
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:17.391
<v Speaker 1>packed into a paragraph and it'll be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of information that disrupts high </v>

338
00:20:17.391 --> 00:20:18.600
<v Speaker 1>level structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't even notice it,</v>

339
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 1>but because it's so subversive and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to do that.</v>

340
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:25.110
<v Speaker 1>It was the name of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had his reasons to do it.</v>

341
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.470
<v Speaker 1>He would say that you have to be broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to nothing before you can be </v>

342
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.461
<v Speaker 1>rebuilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a trip to the underworld </v>

343
00:20:34.461 --> 00:20:34.461
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

344
00:20:34.461 --> 00:20:36.150
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose in many ways that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is.</v>

345
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

346
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you don't learn a new principal without </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing old principles to disappear </v>

347
00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:46.710
<v Speaker 1>because you can't have the new principal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the old principal at the same time.</v>

348
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.960
<v Speaker 1>So almost always any radical learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves the destruction of old habits </v>

349
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 1>and have action and perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

350
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:56.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a kind of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a,</v>

351
00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an abstract death,</v>

352
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at that doesn't make it not painful.</v>

353
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:08.251
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the abstract is of sufficient </v>

354
00:21:08.251 --> 00:21:11.251
<v Speaker 1>intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can drive people to suicide because </v>

355
00:21:11.251 --> 00:21:13.780
<v Speaker 1>they regard killing themselves as easier</v>
<v Speaker 1>than making the reparation,</v>

356
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing the anxiety and the suffering and</v>

357
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:22.650
<v Speaker 1>going through the intolerably difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>task of retooling and they may well </v>

358
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.150
<v Speaker 1>regard that as more emotionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening then death.</v>

359
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 1>And so and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not that rare,</v>

360
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

361
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.240
<v Speaker 1>suicide is rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that rare.</v>

362
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.780
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it certainly a behavior that </v>

363
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.971
<v Speaker 1>everyone is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect everyone here has known </v>

364
00:21:38.971 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 1>someone who was touched by suicide in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some way,</v>

365
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might not be your family member or </v>

366
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.240
<v Speaker 1>even your extended family member,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that you know,</v>

367
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 1>someone who knows someone who committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide is extremely,</v>

368
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.680
<v Speaker 1>extremely likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Nietzsche is a very dangerous,</v>

369
00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:58.681
<v Speaker 1>dangerous thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only person I know who kind of </v>

370
00:21:58.681 --> 00:22:02.490
<v Speaker 1>approaches him and not regard as young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yoga is actually less troublesome </v>

371
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:07.231
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of what does the NSBE </v>
<v Speaker 1>offers is his destruction.</v>

372
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.540
<v Speaker 1>It's intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant destruction,</v>

373
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:15.541
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't really offer a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's sort of sketches out the </v>

374
00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:19.951
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of a solution and he died </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and then in many ways what </v>

375
00:22:19.951 --> 00:22:24.241
<v Speaker 1>happened was that young picked up where </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] left off and tried to solve </v>

376
00:22:24.241 --> 00:22:25.360
<v Speaker 1>the problems that need you left </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsolved,</v>

377
00:22:25.361 --> 00:22:26.590
<v Speaker 1>so it was nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

378
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.860
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with Dostoevsky who really </v>

379
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.261
<v Speaker 1>definitively announced the death of God </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the 19th century in that </v>

380
00:22:34.261 --> 00:22:36.880
<v Speaker 1>left people in some ways bereft of </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

381
00:22:36.881 --> 00:22:39.310
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to talk about why that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so important in a moment.</v>

382
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.460
<v Speaker 1>What union was doing was trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

383
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:47.461
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to rescue the farther from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underworld in the sense he was </v>

384
00:22:47.461 --> 00:22:50.551
<v Speaker 1>trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tried to go back to the religious </v>

385
00:22:50.551 --> 00:22:52.591
<v Speaker 1>traditions that Nietzsche had had </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as fatally anachronistic and </v>

386
00:22:53.531 --> 00:22:58.531
<v Speaker 1>demolished by the claims of science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He attempted to go back to those </v>

387
00:22:58.531 --> 00:23:01.960
<v Speaker 1>religious traditions and reassess them </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a psychological perspective to pull</v>

388
00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:06.961
<v Speaker 1>back the necessary meaning that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in them so that people could </v>

389
00:23:06.961 --> 00:23:10.770
<v Speaker 1>reunite with their culture and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle not be so prone to </v>

390
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.581
<v Speaker 1>pathological belief systems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology that tend to rush in where </v>

391
00:23:14.581 --> 00:23:15.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

392
00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:20.720
<v Speaker 1>a niche has said very clearly and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky knew this as well by the end </v>

393
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.040
<v Speaker 1>of the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the death of God would mean that</v>

394
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:29.041
<v Speaker 1>people would turn on Mohs to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalistic ideologies and that would </v>

395
00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:33.871
<v Speaker 1>be murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew that was coming and that's an </v>

396
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:34.390
<v Speaker 1>amazing prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really is amazing prediction.</v>

397
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 1>It just shows you how thoroughly they </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood the structure.</v>

398
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to read you something by </v>

399
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.371
<v Speaker 1>nature and then we're going to return to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy so that you can kind of </v>

400
00:23:44.371 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 1>understand something deeper about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way the hierarchy is structured.</v>

401
00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's talking about philosophical </v>

402
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.740
<v Speaker 1>ideas here and he's actually talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about articulated ethics.</v>

403
00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:00.130
<v Speaker 1>So one way that you might think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy is that philosophers or </v>

404
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:04.480
<v Speaker 1>originate articulated moral principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is often the way that people </v>

405
00:24:05.031 --> 00:24:08.990
<v Speaker 1>think about especially moral philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's the philosophers who come</v>

406
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:12.030
<v Speaker 1>up with the ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what needs you believe.</v>

407
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Here's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

408
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:21.210
<v Speaker 1>separate philosophical ideas are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything optional or autonomously </v>

409
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.440
<v Speaker 1>evolving.</v>

410
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.580
<v Speaker 1>They grow up in connection and </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with each other.</v>

411
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:33.510
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly an arbitrarily they seem to </v>

412
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.890
<v Speaker 1>appear in the history of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They nevertheless belong just as much to</v>

413
00:24:35.891 --> 00:24:39.850
<v Speaker 1>assist them as the collective members of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fauna of a continent.</v>

414
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very interesting idea.</v>

415
00:24:42.311 --> 00:24:46.330
<v Speaker 1>So the first idea that he's putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward is that you could.</v>

416
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.150
<v Speaker 1>The best way to think about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical system,</v>

417
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:54.270
<v Speaker 1>say a philosophical system of ethics is </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if it's different statements are </v>

418
00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:57.760
<v Speaker 1>animals related to one another in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem.</v>

419
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.940
<v Speaker 1>So he has a biological metaphor in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

420
00:25:00.941 --> 00:25:02.050
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

421
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.300
<v Speaker 1>for the emergence of a philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

422
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It's quite an interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

423
00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:10.951
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes sense because if a </v>

424
00:25:10.951 --> 00:25:14.520
<v Speaker 1>philosophical system of ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a philosophical system that </v>

425
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.420
<v Speaker 1>tells you how and why you should behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain way is about how you should </v>

426
00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.710
<v Speaker 1>act and you're a biological being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course,</v>

427
00:25:20.711 --> 00:25:24.910
<v Speaker 1>it only makes sense that the concepts </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves which are guides to actions,</v>

428
00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:30.210
<v Speaker 1>can logically be considered biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>entities.</v>

429
00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:35.820
<v Speaker 1>They're abstracted biological entities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they still have the same nature as </v>

430
00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.330
<v Speaker 1>biological entities and that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to meet you,</v>

431
00:25:37.331 --> 00:25:39.460
<v Speaker 1>that they're subject to the same rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

432
00:25:39.461 --> 00:25:42.850
<v Speaker 1>this is the sort of place where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreshadows Freud deeply,</v>

433
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.080
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

434
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.340
<v Speaker 1>nature says</v>

435
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:54.300
<v Speaker 1>they never little last belong just as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much to assist them as the collective </v>

436
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:54.700
<v Speaker 1>members of the forerunner of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>continent.</v>

437
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.460
<v Speaker 1>This is be treated in the end by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance.</v>

438
00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.800
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfailingly,</v>

439
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.130
<v Speaker 1>the most diverse philosophers always </v>
<v Speaker 1>fill in,</v>

440
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.800
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a definite fundamental schema.</v>

441
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Possible philosophies under an invisible</v>
<v Speaker 1>spell.</v>

442
00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:12.460
<v Speaker 1>They always resolved once more in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same orbit.</v>

443
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.290
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent of each other,</v>

444
00:26:14.291 --> 00:26:17.500
<v Speaker 1>they may feel themselves with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical or systematic wills.</v>

445
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Something within them leads them </v>
<v Speaker 1>something impels them indefinite order.</v>

446
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:27.150
<v Speaker 1>The one after the other to wit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>innate methodology in relationship of </v>

447
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.501
<v Speaker 1>their ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their thinking is in fact far less a </v>

448
00:26:31.501 --> 00:26:33.360
<v Speaker 1>discovery then direct than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rerecognition,</v>

449
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:38.490
<v Speaker 1>a remembering a return and a homecoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a far off ancient common household of</v>

450
00:26:38.801 --> 00:26:43.801
<v Speaker 1>the soul out of which these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>formerly group philosophizing so far,</v>

451
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 1>it kind of activism of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

452
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here,</v>

453
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.390
<v Speaker 1>here's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

454
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 1>there's two fundamental ideas that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in this,</v>

455
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 1>which actually neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You differentiates.</v>

456
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read you another section </v>

457
00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:20.030
<v Speaker 1>that illuminates the first one.</v>

458
00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 1>It's gradually became clear to me what </v>
<v Speaker 1>every great philosophy up till now has </v>

459
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.341
<v Speaker 1>consisted of namely the confession of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its originator and a species of </v>

460
00:27:30.161 --> 00:27:35.161
<v Speaker 1>involuntary and unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiography and moreover that the </v>

461
00:27:35.161 --> 00:27:39.811
<v Speaker 1>moral or immoral purpose in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy has constituted the true </v>

462
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:41.740
<v Speaker 1>vital germ out of which the entire plant</v>
<v Speaker 1>has always grown.</v>

463
00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a very radical statement.</v>

464
00:27:44.021 --> 00:27:47.120
<v Speaker 1>So because what Nietzsche is saying is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that philosophies,</v>

465
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.180
<v Speaker 1>even when they declare themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational,</v>

466
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 1>are deeply personal and they're also </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily embedded within a </v>

467
00:27:54.941 --> 00:27:58.330
<v Speaker 1>motivational structure that is either </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro or anti life,</v>

468
00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.590
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no value free philosophizing.</v>

469
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:08.130
<v Speaker 1>What there is is the expression of </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically and culturally conditioned </v>

470
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.391
<v Speaker 1>being which is conditioned by let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same sort of fundamental forces that</v>

471
00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Freud described in the in the in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological realm,</v>

472
00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:22.020
<v Speaker 1>and then that's conditioned by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural processes that we just </v>

473
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.681
<v Speaker 1>discussed in relationship to piaget and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then what the philosopher does is </v>

474
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:27.370
<v Speaker 1>observe that all of those things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

475
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Allow that to be articulated and confuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with his own thought.</v>

476
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a brilliant idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's a way of thinking about it.</v>

477
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things Piaget said was that </v>

478
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:43.240
<v Speaker 1>once children start to play games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're young,</v>

479
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.960
<v Speaker 1>collective games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch the children play the </v>

480
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.261
<v Speaker 1>collective games like maybe eight kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>are playing marbles or something like </v>

481
00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:53.140
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can take the young kids out</v>

482
00:28:53.141 --> 00:28:56.080
<v Speaker 1>of the game and you can ask them what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules are.</v>

483
00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 1>And what will happen is you'll get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse set of diverse and paradoxical </v>

484
00:29:01.451 --> 00:29:06.451
<v Speaker 1>set of articulated rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that the children</v>

485
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.880
<v Speaker 1>can play the game when they're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game and we're in there in the context </v>

486
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.451
<v Speaker 1>of all the other people because in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense the game is embedded in pieces in </v>

487
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:17.350
<v Speaker 1>all of them and as long as they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

488
00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:18.130
<v Speaker 1>that all works.</v>

489
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:23.130
<v Speaker 1>But if you pull the child the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the intellectual wherewithal </v>

490
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.090
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describe the patterns of behavior that </v>

491
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:30.091
<v Speaker 1>make up the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's only to say that they know </v>

492
00:29:30.091 --> 00:29:30.670
<v Speaker 1>things that they can't say because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

493
00:29:30.671 --> 00:29:31.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game,</v>

494
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:35.110
<v Speaker 1>the rules of the game come first and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the game emerges.</v>

495
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.900
<v Speaker 1>But that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the game comes first.</v>

496
00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:40.790
<v Speaker 1>And only after that do the rules emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course there's,</v>

497
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:46.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reciprocal relationship </v>

498
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 1>between them because once the rules are </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat articulated,</v>

499
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:48.570
<v Speaker 1>then the game becomes more structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:29:48.571 --> 00:29:49.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

501
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 1>and the rules can become more structured</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

502
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:56.401
<v Speaker 1>So the articulation changes the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What niche you is saying is the same </v>

503
00:29:56.401 --> 00:30:00.331
<v Speaker 1>thing applies to societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says like in so far as you can </v>

504
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:05.341
<v Speaker 1>consider society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a collective game played by millions of </v>

505
00:30:05.341 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 1>people over vast spans of time.</v>

506
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:12.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a game of games in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it emerged from the bottom up.</v>

507
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:17.730
<v Speaker 1>It emerged out of biological impulses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an interpersonal and social </v>

508
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:23.041
<v Speaker 1>interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning and shaping everyone's </v>

509
00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:27.690
<v Speaker 1>behavior and perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happened way before anyone </v>

510
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:32.521
<v Speaker 1>could articulate what those rules were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember when Nisha was writing,</v>

511
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:39.450
<v Speaker 1>there was no real sense of how old the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth was or how old the universe was </v>

512
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.830
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People thought even the radical people </v>

513
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:44.140
<v Speaker 1>thought maybe in terms of hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years,</v>

514
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:49.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we know that the universe is 14 </v>

515
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.230
<v Speaker 1>billion years old and that the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>4 billion years old and that life has </v>

516
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.910
<v Speaker 1>been plentiful on the earth for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>point 5 billion years.</v>

517
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the historical context within </v>

518
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.481
<v Speaker 1>which we've originated has expanded by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by orders of magnitude since the last </v>

519
00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.720
<v Speaker 1>19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what you think that means is</v>

520
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:12.721
<v Speaker 1>that the way that our games have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized stretches impossibly back in </v>

521
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:14.980
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

522
00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.550
<v Speaker 1>Now I already told you I believe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story about lobster dominance,</v>

523
00:31:18.551 --> 00:31:19.360
<v Speaker 1>higher fees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

524
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.630
<v Speaker 1>so even lobsters that's 400 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

525
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.960
<v Speaker 1>lobsters arrayed themselves in a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>space and they regulate each other and </v>

526
00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.230
<v Speaker 1>that means the lobsters essentially have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lobster society and you know,</v>

527
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:37.260
<v Speaker 1>each lobster has biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>predispositions that are quite </v>

528
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.160
<v Speaker 1>determined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're quite a.</v>

529
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 1>The lobster is quite a deterministic </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature,</v>

530
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:47.970
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that those biological </v>

531
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.161
<v Speaker 1>predispositions manifest themselves is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioned and shaped by the social </v>

532
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:52.390
<v Speaker 1>surrounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>

533
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:57.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lobsters start to play games for a </v>

534
00:31:57.391 --> 00:32:01.290
<v Speaker 1>hundred million years ago and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we've taken the tremendously long </v>

535
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.900
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary journey across that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd been playing social games the whole</v>

536
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:09.901
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that the way that we </v>

537
00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:12.880
<v Speaker 1>interacted with each other has evolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's even shaped the way our biology</v>

538
00:32:13.241 --> 00:32:15.960
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself because that's how </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll culture is.</v>

539
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:21.210
<v Speaker 1>And then out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we became more capable of </v>

540
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:21.210
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>

541
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.800
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.590
<v Speaker 1>that's something that really took off </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 7 million years ago with modern</v>

543
00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:31.591
<v Speaker 1>human beings emerging about 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago because we separated from the </v>

544
00:32:31.591 --> 00:32:36.121
<v Speaker 1>common ancestor of peep of human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>in chimpanzees about 7 million years </v>

545
00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:40.141
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell that by doing analysis of </v>

546
00:32:40.141 --> 00:32:41.510
<v Speaker 1>genetic differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the brain expanded very rapidly after</v>

547
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:46.511
<v Speaker 1>that point and our culture became more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more conscious and articulated and </v>

548
00:32:46.511 --> 00:32:48.740
<v Speaker 1>complex and larger and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological,</v>

549
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it became in some ways more dependent</v>

550
00:32:52.851 --> 00:32:57.851
<v Speaker 1>on social norms and less dependent on </v>
<v Speaker 1>deterministic biological </v>

551
00:32:57.851 --> 00:33:01.331
<v Speaker 1>predispositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've still been doing that for a </v>

552
00:33:01.331 --> 00:33:01.331
<v Speaker 1>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

553
00:33:01.331 --> 00:33:03.070
<v Speaker 1>there's good evidence that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

554
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:08.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started using fire about 2 million </v>

555
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.710
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

556
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:09.730
<v Speaker 1>forgive me if I told you this already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

557
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.850
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a human being and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at a champion z one,</v>

558
00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things you see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very different.</v>

559
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Morphologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chimp is much shorter,</v>

560
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much wider and way more powerful.</v>

561
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:26.690
<v Speaker 1>So like a normal mail chimp is about six</v>
<v Speaker 1>times as strong as the strongest Olympic</v>

562
00:33:26.691 --> 00:33:29.420
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't mess with chimps.</v>

563
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.010
<v Speaker 1>They'll tear you apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really,</v>

564
00:33:31.011 --> 00:33:33.320
<v Speaker 1>really strong and dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

565
00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 1>But the chimp is shaped sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

566
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a huge gastrointestinal </v>

567
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:41.640
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

568
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.640
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is mostly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat is leaves and leaves,</v>

569
00:33:43.641 --> 00:33:48.641
<v Speaker 1>have no caloric content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they have to eat immense numbers </v>

570
00:33:48.641 --> 00:33:51.620
<v Speaker 1>of leaves and leaves are hard to digest </v>
<v Speaker 1>so they have to chew them like mad.</v>

571
00:33:51.621 --> 00:33:53.870
<v Speaker 1>So the typical chimps sits around eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day,</v>

572
00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.900
<v Speaker 1>chewing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they have this tremendously </v>

573
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.940
<v Speaker 1>long gastrointestinal system because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes that long to extract any nutrients</v>

574
00:34:01.941 --> 00:34:05.300
<v Speaker 1>out of out of leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we circumvented that man,</v>

575
00:34:05.301 --> 00:34:10.301
<v Speaker 1>as soon as we invented fire and fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed us to outsource our digestion </v>

576
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 1>because if you cook most things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

577
00:34:13.491 --> 00:34:15.230
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly meet.</v>

578
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.410
<v Speaker 1>If you cook them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become much more bioavailable and,</v>

579
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.820
<v Speaker 1>and it takes much less energy to digest </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

580
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.560
<v Speaker 1>So that way you can shrink your gut and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow your brain.</v>

581
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:28.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that's apparently what we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>because here we are,</v>

582
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:33.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively slim at least compared to </v>

583
00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.000
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees and so fire popped up 2 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million years ago.</v>

584
00:34:35.001 --> 00:34:37.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a real cultural revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

585
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.830
<v Speaker 1>that's so old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that culture revolution,</v>

586
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:42.500
<v Speaker 1>that content completely reshaped our </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>

587
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.350
<v Speaker 1>And so this interplay between biology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and culture,</v>

588
00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:48.530
<v Speaker 1>it's been going on for an unimaginably </v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time.</v>

589
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.040
<v Speaker 1>And it conditions everything we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's a complicated idea.</v>

590
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine a wolf pack.</v>

591
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolf pack is a pretty complex,</v>

592
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 1>complicated social group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

593
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a fair bit like a primordial human </v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

594
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.550
<v Speaker 1>which is why dogs have been with us for </v>
<v Speaker 1>25,000</v>

595
00:35:22.551 --> 00:35:25.100
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they were walls that first started</v>

596
00:35:25.101 --> 00:35:26.510
<v Speaker 1>to follow us around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And scabies,</v>

597
00:35:26.511 --> 00:35:29.480
<v Speaker 1>or more likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think someone went out,</v>

598
00:35:29.481 --> 00:35:31.850
<v Speaker 1>some primordial hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went out hunting,</v>

599
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:37.180
<v Speaker 1>killed a wolf female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found the pops and one home for the </v>

600
00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:40.260
<v Speaker 1>children to play with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

601
00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Speaker 1>And that was the origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the origin of the dog.</v>

602
00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it was something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because dogs are basically,</v>

603
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 1>they're basically genetically identical </v>
<v Speaker 1>with wolves.</v>

604
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing is is we can get along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dogs and the reason we can get </v>

605
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 1>lauren with dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because dogs have a social organization,</v>

606
00:35:55.530 --> 00:36:00.530
<v Speaker 1>you could call it a dominance hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fair bit like the Human Social </v>

607
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Organization and so you can see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what it means to be human is the</v>

608
00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 1>same thing that it means to be a pack </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal like a dog or a pack animal,</v>

609
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:11.910
<v Speaker 1>like our domesticated horses and cows </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

610
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 1>which we can domesticate partly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are social.</v>

611
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:19.970
<v Speaker 1>So some of the structure of our social </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization is the same sort of </v>

612
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:24.141
<v Speaker 1>structure that an animal dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy has like a chimpanzee </v>

613
00:36:24.141 --> 00:36:27.801
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we know that chimpanzees and </v>

614
00:36:27.801 --> 00:36:29.010
<v Speaker 1>other primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys for example,</v>

615
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:33.600
<v Speaker 1>are acutely aware of the levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in their social structure.</v>

616
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:35.910
<v Speaker 1>And there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's vervet monkeys.</v>

617
00:36:35.911 --> 00:36:40.911
<v Speaker 1>This is a very funny experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that the top vervet monkeys </v>

618
00:36:40.911 --> 00:36:42.210
<v Speaker 1>are like celebrity monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

619
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.920
<v Speaker 1>and the bottom vervet monkeys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:49.970
<v Speaker 1>dissolute street people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you take some pictures of </v>

621
00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:51.840
<v Speaker 1>dissolute street people who are just at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the hierarchy and you take</v>

622
00:36:51.841 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 1>some pictures of celebrities and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>show pictures to a human audience,</v>

623
00:36:55.651 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 1>and the human audience will look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrities longer.</v>

624
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take the vervet monkeys and you </v>

625
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.381
<v Speaker 1>take photographs of the top ranking </v>
<v Speaker 1>vervet monkeys and the bottom vervet </v>

626
00:37:06.381 --> 00:37:09.771
<v Speaker 1>monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you showed them to vervet monkeys </v>

627
00:37:09.771 --> 00:37:09.850
<v Speaker 1>than the vervet monkeys will look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top ranking Verdun Vervet,</v>

628
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:13.380
<v Speaker 1>monkey photographs more than the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranking vervet monkey photographs.</v>

629
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:18.380
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're transfixed by the individuals </v>

630
00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.560
<v Speaker 1>who are higher up in the in the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

631
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And that makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

632
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:25.941
<v Speaker 1>Because what you should feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in a fairly aggressive </v>

633
00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:28.260
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you should feel,</v>

634
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.260
<v Speaker 1>the closer you are to the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

635
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:36.770
<v Speaker 1>the closer what you should feel for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever's at the top of the dominance </v>

636
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:37.230
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should be.</v>

637
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:40.920
<v Speaker 1>It should be closer and closer to all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

638
00:37:40.921 --> 00:37:45.921
<v Speaker 1>when people feel off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get chills running up and down </v>

639
00:37:45.921 --> 00:37:45.921
<v Speaker 1>their back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their neck,</v>

640
00:37:45.921 --> 00:37:50.721
<v Speaker 1>well white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that happens is because it's </v>

641
00:37:50.721 --> 00:37:50.721
<v Speaker 1>an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>

642
00:37:50.721 --> 00:37:54.050
<v Speaker 1>it's an activism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hangover from the time that when </v>

643
00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:54.870
<v Speaker 1>you were threatened by something awe </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring,</v>

644
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:57.300
<v Speaker 1>let's say a snake or a bear or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

645
00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:02.750
<v Speaker 1>your hair would stand up and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that is so that you look bigger and </v>

646
00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:06.180
<v Speaker 1>you still see this happening all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time with cats right to capsule.</v>

647
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Normally cat's face each other this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

648
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:14.780
<v Speaker 1>But if they start to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turned sideways and that so they </v>

649
00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.300
<v Speaker 1>each look bigger than they puff up their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fur and their tail and that's to show </v>

650
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.770
<v Speaker 1>the other cat that they're really a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than the cat first thought.</v>

651
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:24.771
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they're both doing that so </v>

652
00:38:24.771 --> 00:38:24.771
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit pointless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're just cat.</v>

653
00:38:24.771 --> 00:38:28.891
<v Speaker 1>So you know you can give them a break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is is that the pilot will </v>

654
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:30.630
<v Speaker 1>erect and that's the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

655
00:38:30.631 --> 00:38:35.631
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're listening to very powerful </v>

656
00:38:35.631 --> 00:38:35.631
<v Speaker 1>music and it deeply affects you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get chills.</v>

657
00:38:35.631 --> 00:38:39.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like the hair stands up on the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your neck and that's the signaling of</v>

658
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:44.101
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason you should feel odd to </v>

659
00:38:44.101 --> 00:38:46.831
<v Speaker 1>award something that's higher up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy is because that </v>

660
00:38:46.831 --> 00:38:47.970
<v Speaker 1>thing has power like is there.</v>

661
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more than one reason a that </v>

662
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.961
<v Speaker 1>thing has power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better be careful of it because it </v>

663
00:38:54.961 --> 00:38:57.451
<v Speaker 1>will put you in your place and fast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason the dominance </v>

664
00:38:57.451 --> 00:39:00.961
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy exists is so that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows their place and they don't have to</v>

665
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:05.320
<v Speaker 1>be reminded of it by being half killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a regular basis.</v>

666
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe your nine on a scale of one,</v>

667
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.110
<v Speaker 1>one being the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your number nine,</v>

668
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but number nine and not hurting,</v>

669
00:39:14.891 --> 00:39:17.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot better than number nine in</v>
<v Speaker 1>lying there bleeding on the ground.</v>

670
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.400
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens with dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies is they usually arrange </v>

671
00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.750
<v Speaker 1>themselves in part by power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by no means only empower.</v>

672
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows where they are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everybody stays there and </v>

673
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.480
<v Speaker 1>not even happens over multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations saying in,</v>

674
00:39:32.481 --> 00:39:37.481
<v Speaker 1>in complex primate dominance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trues statuses heritable so,</v>

675
00:39:37.961 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 1>and you know that there's not much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>leap between that.</v>

676
00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Inheritable monitor peace among human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

677
00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:43.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a reflection of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

678
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:48.751
<v Speaker 1>it's much more complex among human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings because it's articulated in </v>

679
00:39:48.751 --> 00:39:49.990
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the same basic thing.</v>

680
00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Niches point was so now imagine in that.</v>

681
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Now here's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that,</v>

682
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.310
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got a garment,</v>

683
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.320
<v Speaker 1>it's art and it's fairly stable and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things you want to do is climb to</v>

684
00:40:14.421 --> 00:40:16.700
<v Speaker 1>the top of the dominant Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you want to do that,</v>

685
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.520
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>High quality mates,</v>

686
00:40:19.521 --> 00:40:22.310
<v Speaker 1>that's the primary reason that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular true in humans.</v>

687
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:27.230
<v Speaker 1>If you're male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because males are much more differential</v>

688
00:40:27.231 --> 00:40:32.231
<v Speaker 1>reproducers that females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means a lot of males fail to </v>

689
00:40:32.231 --> 00:40:33.500
<v Speaker 1>reproduce completely and some reproduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

690
00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the typical woman reproduces at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least some.</v>

691
00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.890
<v Speaker 1>So that means competition is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense among men.</v>

692
00:40:39.891 --> 00:40:44.891
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies tend to be tilted </v>

693
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:46.100
<v Speaker 1>towards male power because competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>means more to them.</v>

694
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:51.190
<v Speaker 1>The outcome is more crucial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now part of what happens is that as </v>

695
00:40:51.411 --> 00:40:54.020
<v Speaker 1>people compete within the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

696
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.200
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is to try to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out who it is that is fit to be on top.</v>

697
00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Now you might think that that's a matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>of power,</v>

698
00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

699
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:12.310
<v Speaker 1>your basic social lefty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social constructionists would have you </v>

700
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:12.320
<v Speaker 1>believe that that was all there is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

701
00:41:12.321 --> 00:41:16.250
<v Speaker 1>is that the whole dominance hierarchy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but a power system.</v>

702
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:21.430
<v Speaker 1>And the people on top are there because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have power and what's there is </v>

703
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:25.931
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that they mean the ability to </v>

704
00:41:25.931 --> 00:41:25.931
<v Speaker 1>enforce their will on other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

705
00:41:25.931 --> 00:41:27.950
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a dopey theory.</v>

706
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if unit dimensional,</v>

707
00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:32.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

708
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>that people are multifaceted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no single motivation.</v>

709
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:38.280
<v Speaker 1>That's king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

710
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:43.300
<v Speaker 1>for Freud it was sex and aggression and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're going to come up with a </v>

711
00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.150
<v Speaker 1>couple of potent candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are two.</v>

712
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:48.110
<v Speaker 1>But there's lots of other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are playful and play as a primary</v>

713
00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:50.120
<v Speaker 1>biological circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

714
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.190
<v Speaker 1>we suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're hungry,</v>

715
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 1>we're thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're affiliative.</v>

716
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity driving the makeup of our </v>

717
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:06.881
<v Speaker 1>personalities and there are biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities into arbitrarily call </v>

718
00:42:06.881 --> 00:42:11.171
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The source of something as complex as </v>

719
00:42:11.171 --> 00:42:11.530
<v Speaker 1>social organization is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

720
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:12.830
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

721
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:17.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a false form of monotheism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy idea and it's the kind of </v>

722
00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:22.340
<v Speaker 1>idea that only people who really don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to think would have.</v>

723
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Because once you come up with that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all power.</v>

724
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to think anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone can say to you,</v>

725
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:33.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is complex phenomena x the way it </v>

726
00:42:33.731 --> 00:42:37.061
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is the economy arranged the way it </v>

727
00:42:37.061 --> 00:42:37.061
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

728
00:42:37.061 --> 00:42:37.940
<v Speaker 1>it's so that the people at the top can </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain their power.</v>

729
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

730
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:45.040
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that accounts for 10 percent </v>

731
00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Speaker 1>of the reason it doesn't get close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

732
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:50.651
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of reasons why hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 1>are structured the way they are,</v>

733
00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:54.890
<v Speaker 1>and sheer physical force is one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

734
00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.780
<v Speaker 1>It's unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

735
00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.840
<v Speaker 1>So Frans de Waal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was watching chimps organize their </v>

736
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.160
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies in the zoo in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holland,</v>

737
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:09.940
<v Speaker 1>noted quite quickly that it was fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical or at least possible for the </v>

738
00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:11.300
<v Speaker 1>meanest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugliest,</v>

739
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.660
<v Speaker 1>strongest mail chimp to be the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>guide.</v>

740
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it was the chip who learned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up a garbage cameron who act the </v>

741
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.220
<v Speaker 1>hell out of it with the stick because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that intimidated his enemies,</v>

742
00:43:22.221 --> 00:43:24.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a bit of creativity,</v>

743
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:25.940
<v Speaker 1>creativity there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

744
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:31.480
<v Speaker 1>but what they found was that the stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies were never run by barbarian </v>

745
00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.130
<v Speaker 1>chimp dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that was that </v>

746
00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.050
<v Speaker 1>coalitions of other males would take </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out because you know,</v>

747
00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

748
00:43:38.631 --> 00:43:43.631
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of antisocial aggressive </v>

749
00:43:43.631 --> 00:43:44.420
<v Speaker 1>male in endure tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

750
00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:45.380
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're tough.</v>

751
00:43:45.381 --> 00:43:50.381
<v Speaker 1>But three lesser friendlier males who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are bound together in a friendship pack,</v>

752
00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 1>which chimpanzees form quite intensely.</v>

753
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:59.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like as soon as that guy turns his </v>
<v Speaker 1>back or has a bad day or gets hurt,</v>

754
00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.460
<v Speaker 1>they're going to jump in there and tear </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to pieces.</v>

755
00:44:01.461 --> 00:44:05.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what below found was that the stabler</v>

756
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:10.930
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee dominance hierarchies were </v>
<v Speaker 1>run usually by males who were </v>

757
00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:15.120
<v Speaker 1>affiliative and gregarious who </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered their social obligation.</v>

758
00:44:15.121 --> 00:44:20.121
<v Speaker 1>So that meant with with regards to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendship network and who were also </v>

759
00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:22.850
<v Speaker 1>very good to the females and the infants</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the truth,</v>

760
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:27.880
<v Speaker 1>even if they weren't his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea there is that power is an </v>

761
00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.380
<v Speaker 1>unstable basis for the maintenance of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy across time.</v>

762
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Because in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even among the chips,</v>

763
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:37.050
<v Speaker 1>you have to have the consent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governed because you'll get a revolution</v>

764
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:42.051
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know you're going to get a </v>

765
00:44:42.051 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 1>revolution if you put people in or </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals in the situation where they have</v>

766
00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:44.760
<v Speaker 1>nothing to lose.</v>

767
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:50.060
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints on how you can act well.</v>

768
00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:55.821
<v Speaker 1>You try to move up the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy system because if you're too </v>

769
00:44:55.821 --> 00:44:58.881
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and selfish and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>grooming anyone else and you're not </v>

770
00:44:58.881 --> 00:45:00.570
<v Speaker 1>communicating with the other creatures </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the truth,</v>

771
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.050
<v Speaker 1>they're going to gang up on you and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>you down.</v>

772
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're going to maneuver your </v>
<v Speaker 1>way up the true,</v>

773
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:12.530
<v Speaker 1>you have to be do it in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized enough so that you don't get </v>

774
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 1>every one against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it means is that to maneuver</v>

775
00:45:16.051 --> 00:45:21.051
<v Speaker 1>up a power hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a complex power art </v>

776
00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:22.170
<v Speaker 1>heartbeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a lot more than powerful.</v>

777
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

778
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:29.990
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we've got this idea that there </v>

779
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:31.530
<v Speaker 1>are principles governing the movement of</v>
<v Speaker 1>peep,</v>

780
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.590
<v Speaker 1>of creatures up a dominance even among </v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals,</v>

781
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:39.500
<v Speaker 1>and one of the defining characteristics </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the that,</v>

782
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.460
<v Speaker 1>that one of the characteristics that </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity makes the limit,</v>

783
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:49.461
<v Speaker 1>that process is that overtime the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't let anybody climb the dominance </v>

784
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:53.460
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy who will destabilize the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance heart.</v>

785
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Because then that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Game over.</v>

786
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:01.460
<v Speaker 1>So at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn how to climb up the </v>

787
00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:01.980
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy so that you don't destabilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>it while you climb,</v>

788
00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:04.950
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you get to the top and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing left.</v>

789
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in animals know this,</v>

790
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:09.150
<v Speaker 1>they know this instinctively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

791
00:46:09.151 --> 00:46:14.151
<v Speaker 1>when wolves go at it first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they puff up and they'd grow with each </v>

792
00:46:14.151 --> 00:46:17.751
<v Speaker 1>other and they put up their shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like they get more and more </v>

793
00:46:17.751 --> 00:46:21.680
<v Speaker 1>aggressive until attack is imminent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>often one of them will back off with </v>

794
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.790
<v Speaker 1>there's no fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one gets damaged.</v>

795
00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:26.910
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the typical situation.</v>

796
00:46:26.911 --> 00:46:28.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like one says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

797
00:46:28.261 --> 00:46:28.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

798
00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:29.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

799
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows why that is.</v>

800
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Often I suspect the wolf with the higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin level winds because it has </v>

801
00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:39.150
<v Speaker 1>less negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Sarah Donin levels go up as you move</v>

802
00:46:39.151 --> 00:46:41.310
<v Speaker 1>up the dominance art now.</v>

803
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:42.520
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll go into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

804
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:47.570
<v Speaker 1>they'll actually have a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fight usually doesn't last very </v>

805
00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:47.670
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the loser will roll over,</v>

806
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.070
<v Speaker 1>throw itch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show its throat to the winter,</v>

807
00:46:50.071 --> 00:46:52.610
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a behavior because wolves</v>
<v Speaker 1>tear the throats out of,</v>

808
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:53.940
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their prey.</v>

809
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.150
<v Speaker 1>And the top woeful back off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

810
00:46:57.151 --> 00:47:02.151
<v Speaker 1>you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unbelievably sophisticated </v>

811
00:47:02.151 --> 00:47:02.400
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there there's echos in there of</v>

812
00:47:02.401 --> 00:47:07.401
<v Speaker 1>the New Testament injunction to love </v>
<v Speaker 1>your enemy because that's exactly what </v>

813
00:47:07.401 --> 00:47:12.291
<v Speaker 1>the wolf is doing and you know it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know this because it can't </v>

814
00:47:12.291 --> 00:47:14.940
<v Speaker 1>articulate the rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it's doing is acting as if even</v>

815
00:47:14.941 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 1>the thing that attacked you is valuable </v>
<v Speaker 1>in its own right.</v>

816
00:47:18.901 --> 00:47:23.400
<v Speaker 1>If it's part of your truth and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see there the,</v>

817
00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancient biological origins of the </v>

818
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 1>idea of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

819
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:32.940
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the equality and value of each </v>

820
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:32.940
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

821
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So these things have deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

822
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:35.590
<v Speaker 1>deep roots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not arbitrary,</v>

823
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:37.930
<v Speaker 1>they're not arbitrary and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>invented them.</v>

824
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what Nietzsche is </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying here.</v>

825
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 1>To understand how the abstruse </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical assertions of a philosopher</v>

826
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:47.350
<v Speaker 1>have been arrived at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is always well.</v>

827
00:47:47.351 --> 00:47:52.351
<v Speaker 1>And why is to first ask oneself what </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality do they or does he aim at?</v>

828
00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Accordingly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe that an impulse to </v>

829
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:02.131
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is the father of philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that another impulse here as </v>

830
00:48:02.131 --> 00:48:06.091
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere has only made use of knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mistaken knowledge as an instrument.</v>

831
00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:12.540
<v Speaker 1>But whoever considers the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses of man with a view to </v>

832
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.951
<v Speaker 1>determining how far they may have here </v>
<v Speaker 1>acted as inspiring Jeannie or as demons </v>

833
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:23.490
<v Speaker 1>will find that they have all practiced </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy at one time or another and </v>

834
00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:26.881
<v Speaker 1>that each of them would have only been </v>
<v Speaker 1>to glad to look upon itself as the </v>

835
00:48:26.881 --> 00:48:29.680
<v Speaker 1>ultimate end of existence and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate lord of over all of the other</v>

836
00:48:29.681 --> 00:48:30.370
<v Speaker 1>impulses.</v>

837
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:32.010
<v Speaker 1>So what is he saying there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

838
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:37.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature makes this explicit in passages </v>

839
00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.681
<v Speaker 1>that are related to this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He viewed the human being as a </v>

840
00:48:40.681 --> 00:48:43.651
<v Speaker 1>collection of sub souls and the souls </v>
<v Speaker 1>were grounded in their existence and in </v>

841
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:49.290
<v Speaker 1>biological underpinnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the case for every human </v>

842
00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:52.591
<v Speaker 1>being in that made us roughly similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly made our groups roughly </v>

843
00:48:52.591 --> 00:48:54.340
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these,</v>

844
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:59.400
<v Speaker 1>each of these biological subsystems </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as a sub soul was </v>

845
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.780
<v Speaker 1>something that had its own viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has its own rules,</v>

846
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:03.760
<v Speaker 1>had its own games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would,</v>

847
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:08.850
<v Speaker 1>they jockey for precedence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that because sometimes </v>

848
00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:12.451
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there reading and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to concentrate on a higher order </v>

849
00:49:12.451 --> 00:49:12.730
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like completing your classes.</v>

850
00:49:12.731 --> 00:49:17.731
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some biologically determined subsystem </v>

851
00:49:17.731 --> 00:49:18.610
<v Speaker 1>pops up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

852
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.010
<v Speaker 1>this would be an excellent time to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a coffee,</v>

853
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might do everything you can to </v>

854
00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:29.020
<v Speaker 1>not allow that thing to take over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often it does.</v>

855
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:34.020
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and often that's despite what you think </v>

856
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you might actually want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then later you're all upset about it</v>

857
00:49:35.621 --> 00:49:38.890
<v Speaker 1>because you've procrastinated yet again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

858
00:49:38.891 --> 00:49:43.891
<v Speaker 1>nature view the psyche as a place you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could almost think of yourself as a set </v>

859
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:49.810
<v Speaker 1>of apps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like your brain is a set of animals</v>

860
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.140
<v Speaker 1>and the animals are all dependent on one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

861
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:56.710
<v Speaker 1>but each animal needs to be boss from </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to time.</v>

862
00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:00.580
<v Speaker 1>And each animal wants to be boss more </v>
<v Speaker 1>often than it should be.</v>

863
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:06.150
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the higher order critical systems are </v>

864
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:10.141
<v Speaker 1>there to figure out how to sequence all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these other animals so that they all </v>

865
00:50:10.141 --> 00:50:14.341
<v Speaker 1>get what they need without interfering </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other across large spans of </v>

866
00:50:14.341 --> 00:50:18.730
<v Speaker 1>time in the presence of many other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in a manner that's sustaining.</v>

867
00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

868
00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

869
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:28.080
<v Speaker 1>so let's go back to the hierarchy so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the hierarchy and overtime.</v>

870
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Now remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this hierarchy stays there for a very </v>

871
00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:37.211
<v Speaker 1>long period of time and remember as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the people who climbed to the top </v>

872
00:50:37.211 --> 00:50:41.771
<v Speaker 1>of the hierarchy are much more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave offspring than the people who </v>

873
00:50:41.771 --> 00:50:46.361
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what that means is that the </v>

874
00:50:46.361 --> 00:50:49.001
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in part is one of the primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection forces operating on humanity </v>

875
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:56.290
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that we evolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the thing that can most </v>

876
00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:59.090
<v Speaker 1>successfully climbed the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>

877
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:04.390
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that we evolve towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that has the best probability </v>

878
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:09.080
<v Speaker 1>of ruling properly and that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just cultural.</v>

879
00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.940
<v Speaker 1>It's cultural because it's the continual</v>
<v Speaker 1>interplay between cultural and biology.</v>

880
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Going back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll save 400 million years or more.</v>

881
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

882
00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's even more complicated than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

883
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:27.390
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things that you </v>

884
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:29.951
<v Speaker 1>have to understand if you really want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what niche of meant by the </v>

885
00:51:29.951 --> 00:51:29.951
<v Speaker 1>death of God.</v>

886
00:51:29.951 --> 00:51:31.580
<v Speaker 1>So because that's his most famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouncement,</v>

887
00:51:31.581 --> 00:51:36.581
<v Speaker 1>God is dead and we have killed them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll never find enough water to wash </v>

888
00:51:36.581 --> 00:51:38.120
<v Speaker 1>away the blood now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he wasn't announcing that in triumph.</v>

889
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.820
<v Speaker 1>He was announcing it in terror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

890
00:51:40.821 --> 00:51:45.620
<v Speaker 1>now imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as human society becomes more complex</v>

891
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:50.770
<v Speaker 1>and as our brains become larger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger so that we can track larger </v>

892
00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:54.140
<v Speaker 1>social organizations and we can organize</v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex communities.</v>

893
00:51:55.610 --> 00:52:00.610
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that here to for </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated tribes of people come together </v>

894
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:06.760
<v Speaker 1>and then they have to engage in conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>and negotiation and partly what they're </v>

895
00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:11.410
<v Speaker 1>in conflict about is what is the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should act and what should the </v>

896
00:52:11.421 --> 00:52:16.421
<v Speaker 1>values be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an old mythological idea </v>

897
00:52:16.421 --> 00:52:19.970
<v Speaker 1>that the gods fight in heaven to see who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the dominant God.</v>

898
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:23.240
<v Speaker 1>While you can imagine all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual tribes,</v>

899
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:28.510
<v Speaker 1>they had their ideals and those were </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures of their imagination,</v>

900
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.600
<v Speaker 1>but those were imagined representations </v>
<v Speaker 1>of proper behavioral patterns and they </v>

901
00:52:34.701 --> 00:52:39.701
<v Speaker 1>saw there was this transcendent 10 super</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinate and so then try bay would come </v>

902
00:52:39.701 --> 00:52:44.651
<v Speaker 1>into contact with tried b be and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guards would clash and out of that,</v>

903
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.730
<v Speaker 1>and I know the death and destruction </v>
<v Speaker 1>that went with it.</v>

904
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:52.750
<v Speaker 1>The two tribes would integrate and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would take hundreds of years and </v>

905
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:53.960
<v Speaker 1>the religious system that sat above </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

906
00:52:53.961 --> 00:52:56.810
<v Speaker 1>which was the representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

907
00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:00.050
<v Speaker 1>would also transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take [inaudible] Bay and you take</v>

908
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:05.051
<v Speaker 1>try b and then you'd take tried c and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you paid try b and they all </v>

909
00:53:05.051 --> 00:53:07.190
<v Speaker 1>accumulate across time and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

910
00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:12.290
<v Speaker 1>and sort out and articulate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent all of their beliefs.</v>

911
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that this tribe has </v>
<v Speaker 1>a game and this tribe has a game and </v>

912
00:53:18.021 --> 00:53:23.021
<v Speaker 1>this tribe has a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you put all those games </v>

913
00:53:23.021 --> 00:53:24.320
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tilt so that a metagame emerges out</v>

914
00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:25.240
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

915
00:53:25.241 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's fortunate,</v>

916
00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:32.120
<v Speaker 1>the best of all three games gets put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in a larger game and it,</v>

917
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.740
<v Speaker 1>it has to be the best because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>it won't work.</v>

918
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.780
<v Speaker 1>The thing will fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

919
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Because if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

920
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:42.360
<v Speaker 1>if your family unit isn't functional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll disperse,</v>

921
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

922
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:46.140
<v Speaker 1>and maybe people will die because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to have the,</v>

923
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:51.170
<v Speaker 1>it has to be iterative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be playable across time </v>

924
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:53.660
<v Speaker 1>without falling apart from internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure and without getting wiped notes</v>

925
00:53:53.661 --> 00:53:56.010
<v Speaker 1>from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very tightly constrained.</v>

926
00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 1>So then let's say this happens over tens</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of years,</v>

927
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:00.650
<v Speaker 1>we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

928
00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:05.660
<v Speaker 1>it happened in the Middle East because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that as Mesopotamia came </v>

929
00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:05.660
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

930
00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:10.160
<v Speaker 1>it was the aggregation of multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes and all of the Gods of those </v>

931
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.271
<v Speaker 1>tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know the Mesopotamians organized </v>

932
00:54:14.271 --> 00:54:15.410
<v Speaker 1>all those gods into one God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name was Marduk.</v>

933
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:20.630
<v Speaker 1>And that the story that they tell about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the aggregation of the gods into one is </v>

934
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:25.371
<v Speaker 1>the story of the gods getting together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and voting on which of them should be at</v>

935
00:54:26.311 --> 00:54:26.880
<v Speaker 1>the talk.</v>

936
00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:32.810
<v Speaker 1>And then we know that the Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 1>emperor was charged with the </v>

937
00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:37.581
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of acting out that taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone and that that's what made him a </v>

938
00:54:38.221 --> 00:54:43.221
<v Speaker 1>good emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got reminded of that every year </v>

939
00:54:43.221 --> 00:54:46.161
<v Speaker 1>at the new year ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to tell all the ways that he </v>

940
00:54:46.161 --> 00:54:47.520
<v Speaker 1>hadn't been a good Marduk and then he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>get punished for it,</v>

941
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:52.790
<v Speaker 1>and then they would reenact the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the gods and recreate this martech </v>

942
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.790
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

943
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:57.531
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can understand how that might've </v>

944
00:54:57.531 --> 00:54:59.810
<v Speaker 1>come about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say that the idea of that </v>

945
00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:03.270
<v Speaker 1>emergent ideal that was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't rational,</v>

946
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:07.670
<v Speaker 1>it was the consequence of conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation in,</v>

947
00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:11.670
<v Speaker 1>in the real world across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The representations of that were,</v>

948
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:17.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might think about them as narrative </v>

949
00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:17.060
<v Speaker 1>representations or if they're deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

950
00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.450
<v Speaker 1>even as an anthology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think about those as the,</v>

951
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:22.050
<v Speaker 1>as the soil for which religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions emerge.</v>

952
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:27.650
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is that what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have at the top of the dominance </v>

953
00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:31.671
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy as your representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good person is no different in its </v>

954
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:38.121
<v Speaker 1>totality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the idea of the sovereign God that </v>

955
00:55:38.121 --> 00:55:40.740
<v Speaker 1>has emerged across thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years of human history,</v>

956
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:46.010
<v Speaker 1>so the whole structure has this thing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top and it's regarded in imagination</v>

957
00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:51.501
<v Speaker 1>as divine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the consequence of the represent </v>

958
00:55:51.501 --> 00:55:53.760
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>

959
00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:59.310
<v Speaker 1>of morality in imagination across </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years,</v>

960
00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:03.900
<v Speaker 1>and that's a reflection of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict and restructuring of society is</v>

961
00:56:03.901 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 1>across all that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you have this thing at the top,</v>

962
00:56:07.261 --> 00:56:09.660
<v Speaker 1>so we could say in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in western Europe,</v>

963
00:56:09.661 --> 00:56:14.661
<v Speaker 1>that thing at the top is Christ and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the dying and the dying and dying</v>

964
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:19.320
<v Speaker 1>and revivifying hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about reasons for that.</v>

965
00:56:19.321 --> 00:56:22.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that can go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underworld and then come back up.</v>

966
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's at the top.</v>

967
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:29.170
<v Speaker 1>What happens when it disappears?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will turn to Dostoevsky for that?</v>

968
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:42.090
<v Speaker 1>This is from notes from underground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is someone who's in the </v>

969
00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:43.840
<v Speaker 1>underground and that's where you go when</v>
<v Speaker 1>your value systems collapsed.</v>

970
00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sick man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a spiteful man.</v>

971
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm an unattractive man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe my liver is diseased.</v>

972
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:56.790
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know nothing at all about my disease </v>

973
00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:56.790
<v Speaker 1>and do not know for certain what ails </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

974
00:56:56.790 --> 00:57:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't consult a doctor for it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>never have I ever respect her medicine </v>

975
00:57:01.781 --> 00:57:06.781
<v Speaker 1>than doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Besides I'm extremely superstitious </v>

976
00:57:06.781 --> 00:57:07.630
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to respect medicine.</v>

977
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am well educated enough not to be </v>

978
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:12.720
<v Speaker 1>superstitious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

979
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.360
<v Speaker 1>But I am superstitious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

980
00:57:13.361 --> 00:57:18.361
<v Speaker 1>I refuse to consult a doctor from spike </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will probably not understand.</v>

981
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that though.</v>

982
00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Of course I can't explain who it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely that I'm more declining in </v>

983
00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.450
<v Speaker 1>this case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By my spite.</v>

984
00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm perfectly well aware that I cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay out the doctors and extract revenge </v>

985
00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:35.320
<v Speaker 1>by not consulting them.</v>

986
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I know better than anyone that by all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this I'm only injuring myself and no one</v>

987
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:40.450
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

988
00:57:40.451 --> 00:57:43.150
<v Speaker 1>if I don't consult a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's from spiked.</v>

989
00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 1>My liver is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

990
00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:49.180
<v Speaker 1>let it get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's a civil servant.</v>

991
00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I low ranting civil servant and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>retired because he got a little bit of </v>

992
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 1>inheritance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

993
00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:02.620
<v Speaker 1>when petitioners used to come for </v>
<v Speaker 1>information to the table at which I sat,</v>

994
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I used to grind my teeth at them and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt intense enjoyment when I succeeded </v>

995
00:58:08.271 --> 00:58:12.100
<v Speaker 1>in making anybody unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost always succeeded.</v>

996
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:15.040
<v Speaker 1>For the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all timid people.</v>

997
00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Of course they were petitioners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

998
00:58:18.371 --> 00:58:20.950
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the chief point about my spite?</v>

999
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole point that the real standard </v>

1000
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.950
<v Speaker 1>lay it in the fact that continually even</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the moment of the acute spleen,</v>

1001
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I was inwardly conscious with shame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was not only not spiteful,</v>

1002
00:58:35.171 --> 00:58:40.171
<v Speaker 1>but not even embittered and that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply scaring sparrows at random and </v>

1003
00:58:40.171 --> 00:58:41.230
<v Speaker 1>amusing myself by it.</v>

1004
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I was lying when I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that I was a spiteful officials,</v>

1005
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I was lying from spike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was simply amusing myself with the </v>

1006
00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.110
<v Speaker 1>petitioners and with the officer and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

1007
00:58:53.111 --> 00:58:58.111
<v Speaker 1>I never could become spiteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was conscious every moment in myself </v>

1008
00:58:58.111 --> 00:59:01.390
<v Speaker 1>of many very many elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely opposite to that.</v>

1009
00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:06.040
<v Speaker 1>I felt them positively swarming in me </v>
<v Speaker 1>these opposite elements.</v>

1010
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I knew that they had been swarming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>me my whole life and craving some outlet</v>

1011
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:12.640
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would not let them out,</v>

1012
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:17.590
<v Speaker 1>would not let them purposely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposely would not let them out.</v>

1013
00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:23.540
<v Speaker 1>He tormented me until I was ashamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drove me to convulsions and sick </v>

1014
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.100
<v Speaker 1>and be at last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At last.</v>

1015
00:59:25.101 --> 00:59:30.101
<v Speaker 1>How are they sick and me now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not fencing gentleman that I'm </v>

1016
00:59:30.101 --> 00:59:33.530
<v Speaker 1>expressing remorse for something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that I'm asking your forgiveness for</v>

1017
00:59:33.531 --> 00:59:38.531
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're fancying that however I </v>

1018
00:59:38.531 --> 00:59:42.311
<v Speaker 1>assure you I do not care if you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not only that I could not become </v>

1019
00:59:42.311 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 1>a spiteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know how to become anything,</v>

1020
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.900
<v Speaker 1>neither spiteful nor kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither a rascal nor and honest man.</v>

1021
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Neither hero nor an insect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm living my life out in my corner,</v>

1022
00:59:57.871 --> 01:00:02.871
<v Speaker 1>taunting myself with the spike lists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless constellation that an </v>

1023
01:00:02.871 --> 01:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>intelligent man cannot become anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

1024
01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's only the fool who becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1025
01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>A direct person I regard as the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal man</v>

1026
01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>as his tender mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature wished to see him once she </v>

1027
01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:25.640
<v Speaker 1>graciously brought them into being on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>

1028
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I not such a man til I'm green in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

1029
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.510
<v Speaker 1>he's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disputing that,</v>

1030
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps the normal man should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

1031
01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:38.420
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it's very beautiful in fact,</v>

1032
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>and I am the more persuaded of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicion if one can call it so by the </v>

1033
01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:48.881
<v Speaker 1>fact that you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance the antithesis of the </v>

1034
01:00:48.881 --> 01:00:51.260
<v Speaker 1>normal man that is the man of acute </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfconsciousness who has come,</v>

1035
01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>of course not out of the lap of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but out of a retort.</v>

1036
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.920
<v Speaker 1>This is also almost mysticism gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suspect this to miss retort made,</v>

1037
01:01:00.171 --> 01:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>man is sometimes so nonplussed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of his intense USCIS,</v>

1038
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>the normal man that with all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated self consciousness,</v>

1039
01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>he genuinely thinks himself a mouse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>automation at all.</v>

1040
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>It may be an acutely conscious mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet it is a mouse.</v>

1041
01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other is a man and therefore etc.</v>

1042
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thE worst of it is he himself,</v>

1043
01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:25.970
<v Speaker 1>his very own self looks on himself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouse.</v>

1044
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>No one asks him to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an important point.</v>

1045
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us look at this mouse in action.</v>

1046
01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Let us suppose for existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

1047
01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:42.220
<v Speaker 1>that it feels insulted and it almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>always feels insulted and it wants to </v>

1048
01:01:42.681 --> 01:01:47.681
<v Speaker 1>revenge itself too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There mAy even be a greater of a </v>

1049
01:01:47.681 --> 01:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>cumulation of spike in it than in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>man of nature and truth,</v>

1050
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.490
<v Speaker 1>the base and nasty desire to vent that </v>
<v Speaker 1>spite on it's a sale.</v>

1051
01:01:54.491 --> 01:01:59.491
<v Speaker 1>Assailant rankles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even more nastily in it than in </v>

1052
01:01:59.491 --> 01:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>the man of nature and truth for throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>these innate stupidity,</v>

1053
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>the latter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The normal mac looks upon his revenge.</v>

1054
01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Is justice pure and simple?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in consequences,</v>

1055
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:13.580
<v Speaker 1>his acute selfconsciousness the mouse </v>
<v Speaker 1>does not believe in any justice at all.</v>

1056
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:19.360
<v Speaker 1>To come at last to the deed itself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the very act of revenge apart from one</v>

1057
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:25.010
<v Speaker 1>the one fundamental nastiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The luck was mouse succeeds in creating </v>

1058
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:28.371
<v Speaker 1>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many other nastiness is in the form </v>

1059
01:02:28.371 --> 01:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>of doubts and questions adds to the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1060
01:02:29.341 --> 01:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>So many unsettled questions that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are inevitably works around it,</v>

1061
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>up around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of fatal brute,</v>

1062
01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>a stinking mess made up of it's doubts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emotions,</v>

1063
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>end of the content spat upon it by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct men of action who stands solemnly</v>

1064
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>about it as judges and arbitrators </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing at it until they're healthy,</v>

1065
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>sides ache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1066
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:56.930
<v Speaker 1>the only thing left for is to dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that with a wave of it's paul and </v>

1067
01:02:56.930 --> 01:03:01.521
<v Speaker 1>with a smile of assumed contempt in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which it does not even itself believe </v>

1068
01:03:01.521 --> 01:03:05.700
<v Speaker 1>and creep ignominiously into its </v>
<v Speaker 1>mousehole there and it's nasty.</v>

1069
01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Stinking underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Home are insulted,</v>

1070
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>crushed and ridiculed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold,</v>

1071
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.160
<v Speaker 1>malignant and above all everlasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>spite for 40 years together,</v>

1072
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 1>it will remember it's injury down to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>smallest most ignominious details,</v>

1073
01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:30.060
<v Speaker 1>and every time we'll add up itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail still more in ignominious,</v>

1074
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:33.270
<v Speaker 1>spitefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teasing and turmeric itself with its own</v>

1075
01:03:33.271 --> 01:03:37.890
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be ashamed of it's imaginings,</v>

1076
01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.920
<v Speaker 1>yet it will recall it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will go over and over every detail.</v>

1077
01:03:40.921 --> 01:03:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It will invent unheard of things against</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

1078
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.550
<v Speaker 1>pretending that those things might have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and will forgive nothing.</v>

1079
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it will begin to revenge itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1080
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:57.380
<v Speaker 1>but as it were piece meal in trivial </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways from behind the stove incognito,</v>

1081
01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.800
<v Speaker 1>without believing either in its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to vengeance or in the success of </v>

1082
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.671
<v Speaker 1>its revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that from all its efforts at </v>

1083
01:04:07.671 --> 01:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will suffer a hundred times more than</v>

1084
01:04:08.281 --> 01:04:12.000
<v Speaker 1>he on whom it revenge itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While he I dare say,</v>

1085
01:04:12.001 --> 01:04:16.310
<v Speaker 1>well not even scratch itself on its </v>
<v Speaker 1>deathbed,</v>

1086
01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.320
<v Speaker 1>it will recall it all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With interest accumulated over all the </v>

1087
01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:26.181
<v Speaker 1>years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that nietzsche dostoevsky were </v>

1088
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:43.950
<v Speaker 1>developing was that</v>

1089
01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:51.350
<v Speaker 1>the dawning of consciousness in western </v>
<v Speaker 1>society of the mythological substructure</v>

1090
01:04:55.770 --> 01:05:00.770
<v Speaker 1>of the value system and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossibility of conceptualizing that or</v>

1091
01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:08.810
<v Speaker 1>proving the validity of it's structured </v>
<v Speaker 1>from scientific means doomed it to do </v>

1092
01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:16.890
<v Speaker 1>the people who were encapsulated in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>system to formal disbelief in it and </v>

1093
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:21.390
<v Speaker 1>what they concluded from that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what dos dsd,</v>

1094
01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>just stripe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that someone with that level of</v>

1095
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:29.761
<v Speaker 1>acute consciousness and cultural self </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge would immediately come become </v>

1096
01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:33.340
<v Speaker 1>fragmented beyond belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unable to act,</v>

1097
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and dangerous,</v>

1098
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>and both osteous in nature and in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>works and dostoevsky developed this idea</v>

1099
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>most particularly in a novel called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>devil's said,</v>

1100
01:05:45.281 --> 01:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>that once that you had got to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1101
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:52.920
<v Speaker 1>which was inevitable if you were smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to take seriously what was going </v>

1102
01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:56.761
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was oNly a tiny step to </v>

1103
01:05:56.761 --> 01:05:56.761
<v Speaker 1>identification with a murderer city </v>
<v Speaker 1>ology.</v>

1104
01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the existentialists started to </v>

1105
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>work up what you might regard as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to this problem,</v>

1106
01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:17.640
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to read character guards</v>

1107
01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:20.430
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>

1108
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It is now cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ChAracter guard was a danish existential</v>

1109
01:06:33.961 --> 01:06:38.820
<v Speaker 1>philosopher and he lived earlier the </v>
<v Speaker 1>niche and he was,</v>

1110
01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:43.850
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think about him as the first </v>

1111
01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>modern psychologist he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the first person to </v>

1112
01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1113
01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.430
<v Speaker 1>of the separate entity of anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>despair.</v>

1114
01:06:53.330 --> 01:06:56.690
<v Speaker 1>It is now about four years ago that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got the notion of wanting to try my luck</v>

1115
01:06:56.691 --> 01:07:01.691
<v Speaker 1>as an author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it quite clearly.</v>

1116
01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:05.550
<v Speaker 1>That was on a sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1117
01:07:05.551 --> 01:07:06.840
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sunday afternoon.</v>

1118
01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I was seated as usual out of doors at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cafe in the fredericksburg garden.</v>

1119
01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd been a student for half a score of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1120
01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:21.440
<v Speaker 1>although never lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my activity nevertheless was like a </v>

1121
01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.171
<v Speaker 1>glittering inactivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of occupation for which I still </v>

1122
01:07:24.171 --> 01:07:26.490
<v Speaker 1>have a great partiality and for which I </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps even have a little genius.</v>

1123
01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I read much spent the remainder of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day idling and thinking our or thinking </v>

1124
01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:34.140
<v Speaker 1>and idling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was all it came to,</v>

1125
01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:39.290
<v Speaker 1>so I sat there and smoke my cigar until </v>
<v Speaker 1>I lapsed into thought among other </v>

1126
01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:43.830
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember these you are goiNg on.</v>

1127
01:07:43.831 --> 01:07:48.831
<v Speaker 1>I said to myself to become an old man </v>
<v Speaker 1>without being anything and without </v>

1128
01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:50.700
<v Speaker 1>really undertaking to do anything on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other hand,</v>

1129
01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:54.630
<v Speaker 1>wherever you look around you in life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in literature,</v>

1130
01:07:54.631 --> 01:07:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you see the celebrated names and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures,</v>

1131
01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:01.880
<v Speaker 1>the precious and much heralded men who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were coming into prominence and who are </v>

1132
01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:05.601
<v Speaker 1>much talked about the many benefactors </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the age who know how to benefit </v>

1133
01:08:05.601 --> 01:08:07.680
<v Speaker 1>mankind by making life easier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier,</v>

1134
01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:11.250
<v Speaker 1>some by railways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others by omnibuses and steamboats,</v>

1135
01:08:11.251 --> 01:08:16.251
<v Speaker 1>others by telegraph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others by easily apprehended </v>

1136
01:08:16.251 --> 01:08:19.551
<v Speaker 1>compendiums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>short and recitals of everything worth </v>

1137
01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:21.971
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally the true benefactors of the </v>

1138
01:08:21.971 --> 01:08:24.110
<v Speaker 1>age who make spiritual existence easier </v>
<v Speaker 1>and easier,</v>

1139
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:28.100
<v Speaker 1>yet more and more significant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what are you doing here?</v>

1140
01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:33.100
<v Speaker 1>My soliloquy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was interrupted for my cigar with </v>

1141
01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.261
<v Speaker 1>smoked out and a new one had to be lit </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I smoked again and then suddenly this</v>

1142
01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>thought flashed through my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must do something,</v>

1143
01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>but in as much with your Limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacities,</v>

1144
01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:44.870
<v Speaker 1>it will be impossible to make anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier than it has become.</v>

1145
01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:50.350
<v Speaker 1>You must with the same humanitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm as the others undertake to </v>

1146
01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:55.691
<v Speaker 1>make something harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This notion pleased me immensely and at </v>

1147
01:08:55.691 --> 01:09:00.461
<v Speaker 1>the same time it flattered me to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I like the rest of them would be </v>

1148
01:09:00.461 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 1>loved and esteemed by the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

1149
01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.200
<v Speaker 1>for when all combined in every way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make everything easier,</v>

1150
01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:12.340
<v Speaker 1>there remains only one possible danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely that the eas becomes so great </v>

1151
01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:16.610
<v Speaker 1>that it becomes altogether too great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there is only one want left,</v>

1152
01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:21.670
<v Speaker 1>though it is not yet felt want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people will want difficulty out of </v>

1153
01:09:21.670 --> 01:09:24.830
<v Speaker 1>love for mankind and out of disparate my</v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing situation,</v>

1154
01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.040
<v Speaker 1>seeing that I had accomplished nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and was unable to make anything easier </v>

1155
01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.911
<v Speaker 1>than it already was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and moved by a genuine interest in those</v>

1156
01:09:34.521 --> 01:09:39.521
<v Speaker 1>who make everything easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that as my task to create </v>

1157
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:41.540
<v Speaker 1>difficulties everywhere.</v>

1158
01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Same idea in different words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a traveler.</v>

1159
01:09:54.501 --> 01:09:59.501
<v Speaker 1>This is nature and this is part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>development of his answer to the </v>

1160
01:09:59.501 --> 01:10:02.891
<v Speaker 1>conundrum that he rates a traveler would</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen many countries and peoples and </v>

1161
01:10:02.891 --> 01:10:07.861
<v Speaker 1>several continents was asked what human </v>
<v Speaker 1>traits he had found everywhere and he </v>

1162
01:10:07.861 --> 01:10:08.630
<v Speaker 1>answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men are inclined to laziness.</v>

1163
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Some will feel that he might've said </v>
<v Speaker 1>with greater justice,</v>

1164
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.720
<v Speaker 1>they are all timid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hide behind customs and opinions at</v>

1165
01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:18.350
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1166
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:23.830
<v Speaker 1>every human being knows very well that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is in this world just once as </v>

1167
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:27.581
<v Speaker 1>something unique and no accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however strange we'll throw together a </v>

1168
01:10:28.281 --> 01:10:32.930
<v Speaker 1>second time into a unity such a curious </v>
<v Speaker 1>and diffuse plurality.</v>

1169
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:36.950
<v Speaker 1>He knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he hides it like a bad conscience.</v>

1170
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Why procurer of his neighbor who insists</v>
<v Speaker 1>on convention and veils himself with it,</v>

1171
01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:51.250
<v Speaker 1>but what is it that compels the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual human being to fear his </v>

1172
01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:53.981
<v Speaker 1>neighbor and to think and act heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion and not to be glad of himself a </v>

1173
01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:57.680
<v Speaker 1>sense of shame perhaps in a few rare </v>
<v Speaker 1>cases in the vast majority,</v>

1174
01:10:57.681 --> 01:10:59.830
<v Speaker 1>it's the desire for comfort and inertia.</v>

1175
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:05.470
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that inclination to laziness of which </v>

1176
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:05.990
<v Speaker 1>the traveler spoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's right.</v>

1177
01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Men are even lazier than they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>timorous,</v>

1178
01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:12.800
<v Speaker 1>and what they fear most is the troubles </v>
<v Speaker 1>with which any unconditional honesty and</v>

1179
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:17.810
<v Speaker 1>nudity would burden them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only artists hate this slovenly life in </v>

1180
01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:21.540
<v Speaker 1>borrowed manners and loosely fitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions and unveiled the secret.</v>

1181
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's bad conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The principle that every human being is </v>

1182
01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:29.250
<v Speaker 1>a unique wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dared to show us the human being as</v>

1183
01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:32.550
<v Speaker 1>he is down to the last muscle himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and himself alone.</v>

1184
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Even more that in this rigorous </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistency of his uniqueness,</v>

1185
01:11:37.741 --> 01:11:42.741
<v Speaker 1>he is beautiful and worth contemplating </v>
<v Speaker 1>as novel and as incredible as any work </v>

1186
01:11:42.741 --> 01:11:44.550
<v Speaker 1>of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by no means dope.</v>

1187
01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:51.370
<v Speaker 1>When a great thinker despises man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their laziness that he despises for</v>

1188
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:54.020
<v Speaker 1>it is on account of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have the appearance of factory</v>

1189
01:11:54.021 --> 01:11:59.021
<v Speaker 1>products and seem indifferent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unworthy of companionship or </v>

1190
01:11:59.021 --> 01:12:02.861
<v Speaker 1>instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The human being who does not wish to </v>

1191
01:12:02.861 --> 01:12:07.631
<v Speaker 1>belong to the mass materially seats must</v>
<v Speaker 1>merely cease being comfortable with </v>

1192
01:12:07.971 --> 01:12:11.870
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let him follow his conscience,</v>

1193
01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:14.660
<v Speaker 1>which shouts at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be yourself.</v>

1194
01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:17.630
<v Speaker 1>What you are at present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

1195
01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:20.510
<v Speaker 1>opining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and desiring.</v>

1196
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:24.660
<v Speaker 1>That's not really you.</v>

1197
01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:40.850
<v Speaker 1>That's nietzsche and dostoevsky and </v>
<v Speaker 1>existentialism in.</v>

1198
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:43.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the bare beginning of the thing.</v>
