1
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to wrap up.</v>

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Freud today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so occupies a strange position in the </v>

3
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>history of psychology because Freud </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a psychologist.</v>

4
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.440
<v Speaker 1>He was a medical doctor and many of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people whose theories were discussing </v>

5
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Speaker 1>that work clinicians were mds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not psychologists well,</v>

6
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>and of course when Freud was around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least when he was trading psychology,</v>

7
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>hadn't yet become an independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

8
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Now the same was true of Yom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and part of the consequence of that was </v>

9
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.901
<v Speaker 1>that when the new science of psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed into what you're studying </v>

10
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:52.701
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalysts and the medical </v>

11
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:56.061
<v Speaker 1>community basically stayed outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and there's never really been a </v>

12
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.250
<v Speaker 1>meeting of the minds between </v>
<v Speaker 1>experimental psychologists and </v>

13
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although by the 19 eighties,</v>

14
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.290
<v Speaker 1>the cognitive psychologists were </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting their discovery of the </v>

15
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.281
<v Speaker 1>cognitive unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which always felt to me a little bit </v>

16
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.390
<v Speaker 1>ungrateful given that Freud had actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid the groundwork for the theory of </v>

17
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious or an elaborated that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite great detail.</v>

18
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 100 years before there's some </v>

19
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.780
<v Speaker 1>resistance in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what a psychoanalyst would </v>

20
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.541
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is some resistance among the </v>

21
00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:35.181
<v Speaker 1>experimental psychology community to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Credit Freud with any of his real </v>

22
00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>discoveries and I think that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate,</v>

23
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.990
<v Speaker 1>partly because he did make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries and be the psychoanalysts </v>

24
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>still understand more about the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the unconscious than modern </v>

25
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.651
<v Speaker 1>experimental psychologists because </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern experimental psychologists insist</v>

26
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>on viewing the brain as that cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>

27
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Something like a computer and that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is.</v>

28
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:03.261
<v Speaker 1>It's a living system composed of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>living subsystems and that means that as</v>

29
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:10.611
<v Speaker 1>we've discussed already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the human psyche and its </v>

30
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>subordinate components are better </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceived of as personalities and </v>

31
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities than in any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

32
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:22.371
<v Speaker 1>Then in systems or an or an information </v>
<v Speaker 1>or that information processing machines </v>

33
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

34
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 1>it's I think perhaps the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental accomplishment of </v>

35
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.800
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysis following me actually to </v>
<v Speaker 1>view the human mind,</v>

36
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:38.991
<v Speaker 1>the human psyche as a place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively integrated subpersonalities </v>

37
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>being when even when modern people talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about themselves,</v>

38
00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:51.411
<v Speaker 1>they talk about the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be roughly the ego in </v>

39
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:51.411
<v Speaker 1>Freudian terms.</v>

40
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 1>They tend to think of themselves as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>unitary phenomenon.</v>

41
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.240
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that notion is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people continually do things that they </v>

42
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:05.851
<v Speaker 1>find themselves doing things that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle they don't want to do or </v>

43
00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>things that they're ashamed of or lying </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they don't want a liar,</v>

44
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.260
<v Speaker 1>generally misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so also of course everybody's </v>

45
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>observations that you can try to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself what to do,</v>

46
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.010
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you've experienced this </v>

47
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly in your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>

48
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>many times when you're sitting down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to study for something,</v>

49
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>particularly if you're not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in it,</v>

50
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.730
<v Speaker 1>they had all sorts of alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities will make themselves </v>

51
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>manifest in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the theater of your,</v>

52
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.460
<v Speaker 1>of your imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in a sense what's happening in in </v>

53
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.661
<v Speaker 1>those situations is that parts of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that are organized,</v>

54
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>organized around other goals or from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday perspective,</v>

55
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:52.741
<v Speaker 1>say driven by other desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to hijack control of your </v>

56
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:58.891
<v Speaker 1>motor output and that frequently happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you find yourself,</v>

57
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.820
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinating or rationalizing or </v>

58
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>displacing.</v>

59
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Those are all Freudian concepts at </v>
<v Speaker 1>displacement would be,</v>

60
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>instead of doing the work you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do,</v>

61
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>you go off and do some other work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

62
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.850
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad way of procrastinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not great because you're not </v>

63
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:25.201
<v Speaker 1>focusing on what you should be focusing </v>
<v Speaker 1>on and so in some sense you're at war </v>

64
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>with yourself and the major player in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>

65
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:32.911
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the ego not be equivalent to Freud's </v>

66
00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:37.021
<v Speaker 1>conscious mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least in the initial phases of his </v>

67
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:39.811
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's somewhat complicated to talk about </v>

68
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:42.211
<v Speaker 1>Freud because of course it's theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed across time and then in the </v>

69
00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:46.021
<v Speaker 1>beginning he basically broke the mind up</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the conscious mind and the </v>

70
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>unconscious mind and you can think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscious mind.</v>

71
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Well that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially that's the you that you can </v>

72
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.071
<v Speaker 1>refer to during day to day experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the unconscious mind is a </v>

73
00:04:56.071 --> 00:05:00.781
<v Speaker 1>storehouse of two broad classes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena and one would be drives that </v>

74
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:10.201
<v Speaker 1>are grounded in instinct that are either</v>
<v Speaker 1>at odds with your current goal or </v>

75
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.120
<v Speaker 1>memories often traumatic that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been able to integrate into your</v>

76
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>conscious framework.</v>

77
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>And so those pesky things take on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own life.</v>

78
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

79
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.690
<v Speaker 1>if you take an animal and you take out </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly large segments of its </v>

80
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.770
<v Speaker 1>cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the animal still organizes itself </v>

81
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>into that animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it starts to lose function,</v>

82
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>especially if you go deep into the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can kill an animal if you go </v>

83
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>deep into the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you stay on the cortical surface,</v>

84
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:51.151
<v Speaker 1>you can take an awful lot of brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue out without interfering with a </v>

85
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>lot of the animal's ability to sustain </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

86
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>And what that shows is that the brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized in such a way.</v>

87
00:05:56.591 --> 00:06:01.591
<v Speaker 1>So that isolated components of it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>take on a function of the entire </v>

88
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:06.791
<v Speaker 1>personality and that demonstration in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense that these sub elements of </v>

89
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>the psyche or or perhaps subsystems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsystems of the brain can organize </v>

90
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>themselves into functional living units.</v>

91
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 1>And it stands to reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you lose an arm,</v>

92
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:22.211
<v Speaker 1>you don't start functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just reorganize your personality </v>

93
00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>minus the arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

94
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

95
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.840
<v Speaker 1>if you have only managed to integrate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain subset of the potential psychic </v>

96
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:33.971
<v Speaker 1>manifestations of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that subset is going to formulate </v>

97
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:39.221
<v Speaker 1>the main personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the other things that you're </v>

98
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:39.221
<v Speaker 1>ignoring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their can't integrate.</v>

99
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:39.221
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have a life of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

100
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.440
<v Speaker 1>They don't just disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so Freud offers the unsettling idea </v>

101
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 1>that you're by no means master in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own house,</v>

102
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.100
<v Speaker 1>and one of the ways you can determine </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is by watching yourself do things </v>

103
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are things,</v>

104
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'd have a hard time facing up to</v>

105
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.180
<v Speaker 1>because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the things that you don't want </v>

106
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>to do are things that you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ashamed of or anxious about.</v>

107
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 1>And then of course there's the defeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you suffer when you.</v>

108
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.960
<v Speaker 1>When your ego is hypothetically in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of this circumstance and you </v>

109
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.051
<v Speaker 1>find your behavior or your thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 1>directed in some direction under the </v>

110
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 1>control of something that you think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've mastered.</v>

111
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>You can really see this in conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>like anorexia.</v>

112
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 1>So especially if it's accompanied by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bulemia,</v>

113
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:29.770
<v Speaker 1>which it often is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anorexia is a.</v>

114
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.110
<v Speaker 1>An eating disorder that causes people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think essentially become extremely </v>

115
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.281
<v Speaker 1>disgusted with their own physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their own physical being and it </v>

116
00:07:39.281 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>works their perceptions terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a,</v>

117
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an anorexic client at one point and she </v>

118
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 1>was a rather small woman of maybe five </v>
<v Speaker 1>to or something like that.</v>

119
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Quite thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously she had anorexia and I asked </v>

120
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 1>her when she was in my office if her </v>
<v Speaker 1>thigh was bigger or smaller than mine.</v>

121
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it was about the same size.</v>

122
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.960
<v Speaker 1>So I took a piece of paper and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>saddle on it and I drew the outline of </v>

123
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 1>my thigh on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I had her sit on the same piece</v>

124
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 1>of paper and she drew the outline of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>thigh.</v>

125
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 1>And of course there was probably that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much space on both sides.</v>

126
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:22.241
<v Speaker 1>Between the two outlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which probably looked at that for 15 </v>

127
00:08:22.241 --> 00:08:22.241
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:08:22.241 --> 00:08:26.800
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could not believe that that could </v>

129
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.081
<v Speaker 1>possibly be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what happens in our </v>

130
00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 1>anorexics is that they stopped being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to look up their whole bodies.</v>

131
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at yourself in the mirror,</v>

132
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to look in a gestalt </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>

133
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:43.091
<v Speaker 1>You have to get a picture of the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alternatively you can focus on small </v>

134
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more you focus on parts,</v>

135
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:50.141
<v Speaker 1>the more difficult it is to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts in relationship to the whole and </v>

136
00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:54.790
<v Speaker 1>anorexics get unbelievably focused on </v>
<v Speaker 1>small elements and they confuse </v>

137
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

138
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.890
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're looking at their arms and </v>

139
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.331
<v Speaker 1>there's some flesh on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they they are unable to make a </v>

140
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:06.040
<v Speaker 1>distinction between the flesh and fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want no fat.</v>

141
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 1>They want to go right down to the bone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can't because they're concerned</v>

142
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:15.981
<v Speaker 1>about that tiny little part or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>this tiny little park or wherever they </v>

143
00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:19.851
<v Speaker 1>happen to be focused there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get completely unable to perceive </v>

144
00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.340
<v Speaker 1>their own bodies and it's quite striking</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

145
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 1>how far that can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the end of it is,</v>

146
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person will start themselves for a </v>

147
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.300
<v Speaker 1>long period of time and of course we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about this and modern </v>

148
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.361
<v Speaker 1>physiological terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feeding behavior is regulated by the </v>

149
00:09:38.361 --> 00:09:38.670
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a.</v>

150
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.760
<v Speaker 1>that's an ancient brain area that </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls fundamental motivational </v>

151
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 1>systems and it's right above the spinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cord and it's a very,</v>

152
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:50.511
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful center of Control and the </v>

153
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:50.511
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

154
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>It's functional enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you this before,</v>

155
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:56.271
<v Speaker 1>that if you take a cat and you take off </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entire cortex and even most of its </v>

156
00:09:56.271 --> 00:10:00.741
<v Speaker 1>emotional systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you leave it just with the </v>

157
00:10:00.741 --> 00:10:02.631
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus and the spinal cord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means it has almost no </v>

158
00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:05.691
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can organize its behavior almost </v>

159
00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 1>perfectly as long as you keep it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple environment.</v>

160
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.230
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anorexic attempts to starve,</v>

161
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:16.250
<v Speaker 1>but so that's a conscious goal you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>say or or that might be an ego related </v>

162
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:22.191
<v Speaker 1>goal or you could even think about it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a goal that's motivated by other </v>

163
00:10:22.191 --> 00:10:25.881
<v Speaker 1>unconscious forces because maybe she </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know exactly why she wants to </v>

164
00:10:25.881 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>

165
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:31.430
<v Speaker 1>what generally happens is she'll run </v>
<v Speaker 1>into an emotionally upsetting situation.</v>

166
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional upset,</v>

167
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 1>say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you anxious or it puts you in </v>

168
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 1>emotional pain.</v>

169
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.540
<v Speaker 1>That activates higher brain centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the hypothalamus,</v>

170
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:47.541
<v Speaker 1>but they're still pretty low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still pretty primordial and one </v>

171
00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 1>of the things that kind of emotional </v>
<v Speaker 1>upset does,</v>

172
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:53.330
<v Speaker 1>let's call it stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is shut off your longterm planning and </v>

173
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.531
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you're stressed in the in </v>

174
00:10:57.531 --> 00:10:57.531
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

175
00:10:57.531 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>in the immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now your body and brain presume that you</v>

176
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:04.791
<v Speaker 1>should devote divert resources from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical future to solving the </v>

177
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:10.191
<v Speaker 1>problem that's right in front of you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's often a more behaviorally </v>

178
00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:13.140
<v Speaker 1>oriented a solution like freezing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawing or something like that.</v>

179
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:16.710
<v Speaker 1>So it shuts off your prefrontal cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as that happens,</v>

180
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 1>then the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

181
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.990
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very powerful system just reaches up </v>

182
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.601
<v Speaker 1>in some sense and dominates the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's been there for God only </v>

183
00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:27.390
<v Speaker 1>knows how long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.580
<v Speaker 1>tens of millions of years and it's job </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to stop you from starving to death.</v>

185
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.580
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that over the course of </v>

186
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.041
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who had a relatively weak </v>

187
00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:43.770
<v Speaker 1>feeding instinct died and so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't our ancestors.</v>

188
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:48.771
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens to the Balsamic is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something will upset them and then </v>

189
00:11:48.771 --> 00:11:53.300
<v Speaker 1>they'll get an uncontrollable desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For often something that's high calorie </v>

190
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.891
<v Speaker 1>and sweet and full of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logically enough because they're </v>

191
00:11:57.891 --> 00:12:00.631
<v Speaker 1>starving and then they'll eat like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole quart of ice cream and two loaves </v>

192
00:12:00.631 --> 00:12:01.660
<v Speaker 1>of bread and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they described the state that they're in</v>

193
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:04.510
<v Speaker 1>while they're doing that as dissociated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

195
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine why in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean partly is the whole realm of </v>

196
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>eating behavior and it eating is as some</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

197
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:17.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a drive.</v>

198
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Like when you think about when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

199
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not like your brain is moving.</v>

200
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.990
<v Speaker 1>You literally step by determined step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that you start fantasizing about </v>

201
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 1>food and you start thinking about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you may be wanted.</v>

202
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:35.941
<v Speaker 1>Then you start to make plans about where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go or how you're going </v>

203
00:12:35.941 --> 00:12:36.260
<v Speaker 1>to cook and what social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

204
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.030
<v Speaker 1>what social surround there's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a whole bunch of things and that's,</v>

205
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>that's the hungry you well in an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an anorexic or Bulimic,</v>

206
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Speaker 1>the hungry part of the person is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissociated from the part,</v>

207
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.210
<v Speaker 1>the ego apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're basically in a war.</v>

208
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:57.211
<v Speaker 1>But one of the problems with being in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>war with your hypothalamus is that it </v>

209
00:12:57.211 --> 00:12:59.260
<v Speaker 1>almost always wins and it's a good thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you die,</v>

210
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lots of anorexics do manage to </v>

211
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.661
<v Speaker 1>starve themselves to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a good example of just </v>

212
00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:09.690
<v Speaker 1>exactly how dissociable the mind can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mind is,</v>

213
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.020
<v Speaker 1>is also the brain is dissociable in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangest possible ways.</v>

214
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.790
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

215
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the name of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndrome.</v>

216
00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:22.780
<v Speaker 1>It might pop into my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so you can have a particular kind of</v>

217
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 1>stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the effect of the stroke.</v>

218
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.740
<v Speaker 1>You develop the fixed delusion that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's very close to you capgras </v>

219
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:38.101
<v Speaker 1>syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person who's very close to you has </v>

220
00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:41.641
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has died or being kidnapped or somehow </v>

221
00:13:41.641 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 1>disappeared and has been replaced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>their exact double.</v>

222
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously something,</v>

223
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.040
<v Speaker 1>it manifests itself as something akin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosis.</v>

224
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:56.490
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is that the stroke </v>
<v Speaker 1>damages the relationship between the </v>

225
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:02.250
<v Speaker 1>generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the visual systems that identify faces </v>

226
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.580
<v Speaker 1>and the emotional systems that tag the </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified face with familiar emotions.</v>

227
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:10.861
<v Speaker 1>So basically what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it happens to you and it's </v>

228
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:10.861
<v Speaker 1>your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at your mother,</v>

229
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.670
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:17.671
<v Speaker 1>your mother comes with a whole complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>of memories and you know she's sat in a,</v>

231
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.720
<v Speaker 1>in a very broad context of memory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and then you look at this person</v>

232
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Speaker 1>and it looks like your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of that is happening.</v>

233
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>And so then you develop this idea as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

234
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:29.920
<v Speaker 1>If it's not my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks exactly like my mother.</v>

235
00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Well then what could possibly be going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

236
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:36.871
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously she's being taken away </v>

237
00:14:36.871 --> 00:14:41.221
<v Speaker 1>and replaced by her exact duplicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get into real trouble with this </v>

238
00:14:41.221 --> 00:14:43.540
<v Speaker 1>sort of delusion as you might imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they get obsessed with trying to</v>

239
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what did you do with my mother?</v>

240
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.340
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the,</v>

241
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.470
<v Speaker 1>here's a weirder thing even which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

242
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.960
<v Speaker 1>it's modality specific so that if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to their mother on the phone,</v>

243
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.360
<v Speaker 1>that's their mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

244
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.390
<v Speaker 1>So you see exactly how dissociable the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is.</v>

245
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.140
<v Speaker 1>The mind is even down to small sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>functions,</v>

246
00:15:07.141 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 1>so there are people with strokes who can</v>
<v Speaker 1>sing but who can't talk,</v>

247
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.520
<v Speaker 1>and there are people who lose nouns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people who lose only versed </v>

248
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.120
<v Speaker 1>and there are people who can identify </v>
<v Speaker 1>things but they can't name them.</v>

249
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:22.690
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that the brain is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissociable entity is obviously correct.</v>

250
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:28.490
<v Speaker 1>And here's another example of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you dissociate all the time.</v>

251
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the way the brain is </v>

252
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.241
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a strip right about here </v>

253
00:15:37.241 --> 00:15:40.601
<v Speaker 1>called the motor strip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you are doing brain surgery and </v>

254
00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 1>you touch someone with an electrode on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that strip,</v>

255
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:44.000
<v Speaker 1>they'll move the corresponding part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>

256
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.110
<v Speaker 1>And the hands are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very overrepresented.</v>

257
00:15:48.111 --> 00:15:51.740
<v Speaker 1>And so is the face and the lips and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue for obvious reasons.</v>

258
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.640
<v Speaker 1>We fiddle around with the world a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We move our arms and our hands a lot,</v>

259
00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:00.670
<v Speaker 1>the feeder overrepresented too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we communicate about that with </v>

260
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.290
<v Speaker 1>our face and our tongues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's huge representation there.</v>

261
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and if you touch that,</v>

262
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:11.771
<v Speaker 1>you'll get an emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least the person will will </v>

263
00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:15.880
<v Speaker 1>describe a strong impulse to move well </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of that grew the prefrontal cortex </v>

264
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:21.041
<v Speaker 1>and the best way to think of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that as the substrate of </v>

265
00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 1>abstract thought.</v>

266
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a good way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because you're not really out </v>

267
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.661
<v Speaker 1>to think you're out to act and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason you think is so that you can try </v>

268
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:36.791
<v Speaker 1>out some actions in a little world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy before you implement them in </v>

269
00:16:36.791 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Speaker 1>your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

270
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:43.301
<v Speaker 1>So to think thing things through means </v>
<v Speaker 1>to conjure up an abstracted world and </v>

271
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:48.491
<v Speaker 1>then to conjure up a representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself acting in that world to </v>

272
00:16:48.491 --> 00:16:51.980
<v Speaker 1>calculate the consequences and then to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide whether you're going to implement</v>

273
00:16:51.981 --> 00:16:52.220
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

274
00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:57.221
<v Speaker 1>that's another form of dissociate </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability because you can think without </v>

275
00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:58.220
<v Speaker 1>acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you know,</v>

276
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:03.490
<v Speaker 1>it certainly that part of you that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to conjure up the alternative </v>

277
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.300
<v Speaker 1>worlds that human beings seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly identify with.</v>

278
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:10.320
<v Speaker 1>You know that part that's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least modern people really think of </v>

279
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.120
<v Speaker 1>the part that's thinking as them or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part that's capable of abstract ideas,</v>

280
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:19.390
<v Speaker 1>and if it wasn't dissociable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd just act out everything you </v>

281
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.390
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that wouldn't work very well,</v>

282
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.380
<v Speaker 1>so the brain is actually designed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways,</v>

283
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.830
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be dissociable now.</v>

284
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:28.790
<v Speaker 1>So if you understand that and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the two,</v>

285
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:34.390
<v Speaker 1>the two ela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two sets of phenomena that are </v>

286
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.021
<v Speaker 1>likely to be dissociated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you kind of got the essence of </v>

287
00:17:38.021 --> 00:17:42.431
<v Speaker 1>Freudian theory and the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to be dissociated are one </v>

288
00:17:42.431 --> 00:17:45.770
<v Speaker 1>memories that were traumatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll talk about that in a minute.</v>

289
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.410
<v Speaker 1>And two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses,</v>

290
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 1>they're not impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not even drives,</v>

291
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:52.830
<v Speaker 1>which was the freud way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

292
00:17:52.831 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 1>They're subpersonalities troublesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities,</v>

293
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.880
<v Speaker 1>and you can imagine that those would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>linked to complex,</v>

294
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.420
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One might be resentment,</v>

295
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 1>guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame,</v>

296
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.750
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

297
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.480
<v Speaker 1>jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rage,</v>

298
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.210
<v Speaker 1>lust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those emotions are,</v>

299
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.660
<v Speaker 1>are difficult to integrate into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality property,</v>

300
00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:18.960
<v Speaker 1>partly because in their pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation,</v>

301
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.610
<v Speaker 1>they're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They disrupt the social order,</v>

302
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

303
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 1>think about how well regulated all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are sitting here,</v>

304
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

305
00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:34.581
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 6 million years since you </v>

306
00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:35.370
<v Speaker 1>dissociated or since you've diverged </v>
<v Speaker 1>from chimpanzees,</v>

307
00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:39.390
<v Speaker 1>if we took a bunch of chimpanzees that </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew each other as well as you know each</v>

308
00:18:39.391 --> 00:18:44.391
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place would be an absolute brutal </v>

309
00:18:44.391 --> 00:18:44.391
<v Speaker 1>massacre.</v>

310
00:18:44.391 --> 00:18:45.140
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

311
00:18:45.141 --> 00:18:50.141
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can control your primordial </v>

312
00:18:50.141 --> 00:18:52.350
<v Speaker 1>instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it.</v>

313
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 1>That's how Freud would look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've learned to control them.</v>

314
00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.620
<v Speaker 1>And Freud's theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where it differs from the </v>

315
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 1>theories that we talked about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say with regards to piaget,</v>

316
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Freud's theory is really more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

317
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:10.460
<v Speaker 1>He thought of all of these potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsystems and memories conflicting with</v>

318
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.630
<v Speaker 1>each other like a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hog Z in war.</v>

319
00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:19.890
<v Speaker 1>So hobbes was the philosopher who said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that life is nasty,</v>

320
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:21.000
<v Speaker 1>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and short.</v>

321
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.660
<v Speaker 1>And that in the state of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is at war with everyone else.</v>

322
00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:26.590
<v Speaker 1>And so you need a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

323
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.270
<v Speaker 1>a Leviathan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a top down control system,</v>

324
00:19:30.271 --> 00:19:34.800
<v Speaker 1>a Leviathan who will punish any deviance</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the social contract.</v>

325
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Freudian Super Ego.</v>

326
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought of the unconscious and the</v>

327
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:43.990
<v Speaker 1>conscious mind to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but later he dissociated that up into in</v>

328
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.780
<v Speaker 1>ego and superego.</v>

329
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.440
<v Speaker 1>And then he thought that each of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>had their unconscious elements.</v>

330
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.780
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

331
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.790
<v Speaker 1>if you're under the grip of an ID </v>
<v Speaker 1>related subpersonality,</v>

332
00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:58.470
<v Speaker 1>let's say you could be conscious of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

333
00:19:58.471 --> 00:20:03.471
<v Speaker 1>but there's the possibility for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other interrelated </v>

334
00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:06.681
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those would be in your unconscious </v>

335
00:20:06.681 --> 00:20:08.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's also possible and highly likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

336
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.790
<v Speaker 1>that the way that you're perceiving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and the way you're acting in it,</v>

337
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.910
<v Speaker 1>and even what you state as your goals </v>
<v Speaker 1>are influenced in ways that you don't </v>

338
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.620
<v Speaker 1>understand by the action of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious system.</v>

339
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:21.450
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe some of you are headed for medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

341
00:20:23.551 --> 00:20:28.551
<v Speaker 1>And if I asked you why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will give me six humanitarian </v>

342
00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:31.011
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the actual reason is is because you </v>

343
00:20:31.011 --> 00:20:34.031
<v Speaker 1>know your grandmother would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointed if you weren't and she </v>

344
00:20:34.031 --> 00:20:34.890
<v Speaker 1>might not even be alive anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:39.891
<v Speaker 1>she may have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mother may have imitated your </v>

346
00:20:39.891 --> 00:20:42.351
<v Speaker 1>grandmother so that that ideal is firmly</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodied in her and that set up the </v>

347
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:48.110
<v Speaker 1>unspoken expectations about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior ever since you were a tiny </v>

348
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.110
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

349
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.440
<v Speaker 1>So now it's an interesting sub element </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

350
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.520
<v Speaker 1>of psychodynamic theory too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really something to watch for </v>

351
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.260
<v Speaker 1>in your personal relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

352
00:20:56.261 --> 00:21:00.160
<v Speaker 1>very frequently if you watch carefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can see someone,</v>

353
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:05.161
<v Speaker 1>especially someone you love because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to know them well being taken over </v>

354
00:21:05.161 --> 00:21:08.440
<v Speaker 1>in some sense by the spirit of one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ancestors.</v>

355
00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean this in a metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

356
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

357
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.770
<v Speaker 1>the thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality of the grandmother or </v>

358
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.611
<v Speaker 1>the personality of the mother has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a structure that's well known to </v>

359
00:21:23.611 --> 00:21:27.961
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the individual in question and that </v>

360
00:21:27.961 --> 00:21:30.541
<v Speaker 1>individual spent a lot of time imitating</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in all sorts of ways and those </v>

361
00:21:30.541 --> 00:21:35.281
<v Speaker 1>imitated structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can it be passed down generation to </v>

362
00:21:35.281 --> 00:21:35.281
<v Speaker 1>generation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

363
00:21:35.281 --> 00:21:39.481
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's partly what constitutes your </v>

364
00:21:39.481 --> 00:21:39.481
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

365
00:21:39.481 --> 00:21:43.141
<v Speaker 1>It's the imitated personality of all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ancestors that constitutes your </v>

366
00:21:43.141 --> 00:21:44.950
<v Speaker 1>culture and those things can possess </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

367
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Ideologies possess you and exact not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same way,</v>

368
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:51.430
<v Speaker 1>but in a very similar way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

369
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got the end and you've got the</v>

370
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:57.970
<v Speaker 1>ego and the Superego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as in the hot seat and worldview,</v>

371
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:03.120
<v Speaker 1>there's real tension between them so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the end is always trying to get </v>

372
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.900
<v Speaker 1>it's based gratifications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's based desires,</v>

373
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.920
<v Speaker 1>gratifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in the infrared and times that was </v>

374
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.601
<v Speaker 1>mostly problematic in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex and the reasons for that are quite </v>

375
00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:18.520
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no valid birth control.</v>

376
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:24.460
<v Speaker 1>There was very little employment option </v>
<v Speaker 1>for women.</v>

377
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.890
<v Speaker 1>So there sexual behavior had to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

378
00:22:26.891 --> 00:22:31.891
<v Speaker 1>very tightly regulated or they'd fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the social structure into </v>

379
00:22:31.891 --> 00:22:35.260
<v Speaker 1>prostitution or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the threat of various</v>

380
00:22:35.261 --> 00:22:38.350
<v Speaker 1>venereal diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most particularly syphilis,</v>

381
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:39.280
<v Speaker 1>which is as awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

382
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:44.300
<v Speaker 1>diseases you can imagine if it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitate or mimic all sorts of other </v>

383
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:44.440
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

384
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 1>And it's transmissible from mother to </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

385
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.220
<v Speaker 1>So it's a nasty one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sick,</v>

386
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.600
<v Speaker 1>it was very difficult for the victorians</v>
<v Speaker 1>to integrate sexuality because,</v>

387
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how did you do that?</v>

388
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:02.110
<v Speaker 1>They're the one pathway to potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration.</v>

389
00:23:02.111 --> 00:23:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Something the Super Ego say would </v>
<v Speaker 1>approve of was American pathway,</v>

390
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:09.940
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people back then back in the 19 sixties,</v>

391
00:23:09.941 --> 00:23:12.760
<v Speaker 1>people were getting married around 19 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

392
00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:14.770
<v Speaker 1>but that's actually a historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>anomaly.</v>

393
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean typically speaking in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Victorian age,</v>

394
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:23.190
<v Speaker 1>a man usually couldn't afford to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>married until he was in his mid to late </v>

395
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.520
<v Speaker 1>twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't have the resources,</v>

396
00:23:23.521 --> 00:23:25.510
<v Speaker 1>so women were married usually younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

397
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.370
<v Speaker 1>but so there was a long period of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

398
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:33.570
<v Speaker 1>for men particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for women where the sexual </v>

399
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.190
<v Speaker 1>drive from a Freudian perspective was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>

400
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.180
<v Speaker 1>was fully flourishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully manifesting itself,</v>

401
00:23:40.181 --> 00:23:45.181
<v Speaker 1>but there was no socially approved mode </v>
<v Speaker 1>of expression and so under those </v>

402
00:23:45.201 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 1>conditions there's a war between the ID </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the superego in a sense,</v>

403
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:51.230
<v Speaker 1>and Portland ego was crushed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

404
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Now you could certainly see that when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were watching the movie,</v>

405
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:59.801
<v Speaker 1>the crumb brothers movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they are basically in the same </v>

406
00:23:59.801 --> 00:23:59.801
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

407
00:23:59.801 --> 00:24:03.430
<v Speaker 1>There was no socially approved way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could manifest any sexual or any </v>

408
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:08.111
<v Speaker 1>aggressive behavior and what happened as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence was that the both of those</v>

409
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.550
<v Speaker 1>fundamental subpersonalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call them,</v>

410
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.730
<v Speaker 1>become incredibly pathologized as </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly characterized by resentment</v>

411
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.070
<v Speaker 1>and the desire for revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because remember,</v>

412
00:24:19.071 --> 00:24:21.080
<v Speaker 1>these systems think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

413
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 1>if someone's excrutiatingly sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated,</v>

414
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:29.741
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's think about it in the broader </v>

415
00:24:29.741 --> 00:24:30.170
<v Speaker 1>scheme of things because sexuality isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

416
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not a narrow unit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dimensional drive it,</v>

417
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.330
<v Speaker 1>you know it's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>playfulness and it's associated with the</v>

418
00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:43.331
<v Speaker 1>desire for social contact and the desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>for communication and the desire for </v>

419
00:24:43.331 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 1>touching like it's a complicated multi </v>
<v Speaker 1>branching phenomenon.</v>

420
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Well in in the case of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were watching in the movie,</v>

421
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 1>none of that was either integrate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into their personalities,</v>

422
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:58.120
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or permitted by society and so it it.</v>

423
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:03.420
<v Speaker 1>It was bent and warped and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated and then generated all sorts </v>

424
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.650
<v Speaker 1>of ideas about resentment and revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>around it.</v>

425
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.980
<v Speaker 1>So you can develop an incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an incredibly pathological </v>

426
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.000
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the one cartoon,</v>

427
00:25:14.001 --> 00:25:17.600
<v Speaker 1>if you remember when it was the one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was most disturbing,</v>

428
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:21.830
<v Speaker 1>where Mr Natural brought Robert that </v>
<v Speaker 1>headless woman,</v>

429
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:27.050
<v Speaker 1>so he wanted pure gratification without </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

430
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:32.051
<v Speaker 1>so it's a really driven phenomena and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had intercourse with her and </v>

431
00:25:32.051 --> 00:25:34.670
<v Speaker 1>immediately asked her that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably guilty.</v>

432
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.850
<v Speaker 1>You know when you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you think about what that must mean.</v>

433
00:25:37.851 --> 00:25:41.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone is under the grip of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one subpersonalities.</v>

434
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:46.770
<v Speaker 1>It shaping all of their thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their memories and their emotions and </v>

435
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:47.780
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden that becomes gratified </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's satiated.</v>

436
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.650
<v Speaker 1>It disappears in Bang up comes the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and it's you know,</v>

437
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:53.510
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this particular example,</v>

438
00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:57.830
<v Speaker 1>it was guilt and shame and anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terror even and self loathing.</v>

439
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.310
<v Speaker 1>All of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you read about the experiences of</v>

440
00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>people who commit particularly atrocious</v>
<v Speaker 1>crimes,</v>

441
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:09.310
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common for them to experience </v>

442
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.501
<v Speaker 1>exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are driven by sexual slash </v>

443
00:26:11.501 --> 00:26:15.431
<v Speaker 1>aggressive impulses because those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally the ones that culminated in </v>

444
00:26:15.431 --> 00:26:16.610
<v Speaker 1>the particularly atrocious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.990
<v Speaker 1>individual crimes and they'll commit </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and then the instantly flipped back</v>

446
00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:25.991
<v Speaker 1>into their normative personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except they're absolutely terrified by </v>

447
00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:29.381
<v Speaker 1>what they did and you know it's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than one person is inhabiting the same </v>

448
00:26:29.381 --> 00:26:33.260
<v Speaker 1>psych and it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're tied together by memory.</v>

449
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:38.261
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although Freud would say you can also </v>

450
00:26:38.261 --> 00:26:41.531
<v Speaker 1>dissociate memory and so Freud talked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about memories being repressed </v>

451
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.790
<v Speaker 1>and that's caused an awful lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble because,</v>

452
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:51.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a whole variety of reasons because </v>

453
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:56.410
<v Speaker 1>because memory is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory is not the object of recording.</v>

454
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not the objective unbiased </v>
<v Speaker 1>recording of actually occurring events.</v>

455
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:11.540
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't actually objective </v>

456
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.210
<v Speaker 1>where you record certain kinds of nets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we talked about this before.</v>

457
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:17.211
<v Speaker 1>You can't really objective where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>record a discussion between a man and a </v>

458
00:27:17.211 --> 00:27:21.621
<v Speaker 1>woman who'd been married for 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>about anything important because for </v>

459
00:27:21.621 --> 00:27:25.491
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each word and each phrase and each </v>

460
00:27:25.491 --> 00:27:28.491
<v Speaker 1>sentence and each facial expression has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be interpreted within the context of </v>

461
00:27:28.491 --> 00:27:33.171
<v Speaker 1>the entire relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order for the meaning of the </v>

462
00:27:33.171 --> 00:27:36.801
<v Speaker 1>utterances to be extracted and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just no way you can record that in the </v>

463
00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:36.801
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

464
00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:41.000
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to have videoed the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and so you're not going to </v>

465
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so memory is a very,</v>

466
00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:47.421
<v Speaker 1>very peculiar thing and the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have an objective restaurant </v>

467
00:27:47.421 --> 00:27:49.890
<v Speaker 1>is not a very sophisticated idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

468
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Freud's idea in some sense he had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat,</v>

469
00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say it was an inner </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently sophisticated notion of </v>

470
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:02.940
<v Speaker 1>what memory was.</v>

471
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Now I hate to say that because Freud was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very sophisticated person,</v>

472
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:11.690
<v Speaker 1>but he did in some sense believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence of an objective interpersonal </v>

473
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:16.491
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he thought if something terrible </v>

474
00:28:16.491 --> 00:28:18.030
<v Speaker 1>happened to you when you were a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had a record of the memory.</v>

475
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.240
<v Speaker 1>It was there as the memory as the event </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you needed something that would</v>

476
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 1>like a sensor that would repress that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you needed a place for it to be</v>

477
00:28:29.161 --> 00:28:31.440
<v Speaker 1>repressed into which would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

478
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.250
<v Speaker 1>But if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you take a part,</v>

479
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:38.640
<v Speaker 1>a traumatic memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking with someone,</v>

480
00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:43.641
<v Speaker 1>I heard that he also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also thought that that repressed </v>

481
00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:47.091
<v Speaker 1>memory might be represented in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a symptom,</v>

482
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:52.390
<v Speaker 1>a symbolic symptom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

483
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that the repression theory</v>

484
00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.300
<v Speaker 1>suffers from the inadequacy of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of memory because he,</v>

485
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.740
<v Speaker 1>here's a different way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

486
00:29:00.741 --> 00:29:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It's more in keeping with the layer </v>
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>

487
00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:06.920
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchical layer model that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been entertaining as we progress.</v>

488
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.540
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

489
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.880
<v Speaker 1>molested by your uncle because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually a family member when you're for </v>

490
00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.780
<v Speaker 1>sexually molested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

491
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.200
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you have to ask yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just exactly what kind of memory do </v>

492
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.221
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're completely sexually </v>

493
00:29:27.221 --> 00:29:29.681
<v Speaker 1>naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means you know nothing </v>

494
00:29:29.681 --> 00:29:30.130
<v Speaker 1>about the sexual act and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

495
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's implications or the mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this happens to you.</v>

496
00:29:33.231 --> 00:29:36.680
<v Speaker 1>So the first question is how do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent that?</v>

497
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:38.750
<v Speaker 1>And that sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because to rip,</v>

498
00:29:38.751 --> 00:29:40.700
<v Speaker 1>to remember something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to represent it.</v>

499
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:45.760
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing is you don't just have </v>

500
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.091
<v Speaker 1>a memory of that event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always interpretation because </v>

501
00:29:48.091 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things going on.</v>

502
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you,</v>

503
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe your representation is pain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion,</v>

504
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:59.220
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there'd be another layer over </v>

505
00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.680
<v Speaker 1>that which would be the necessity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>secrecy because of course the person who</v>

506
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:04.900
<v Speaker 1>does the molesting is going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

507
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 1>one of two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

508
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:09.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked for it,</v>

509
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.780
<v Speaker 1>don't tell anyone or or they'll think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad person.</v>

510
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 1>This will be our little secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

511
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:21.270
<v Speaker 1>So then there's that whole overlay of </v>
<v Speaker 1>secrecy and inadmissibility and what are</v>

512
00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:27.841
<v Speaker 1>you supposed to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're for how are you supposed to </v>

513
00:30:27.841 --> 00:30:28.210
<v Speaker 1>understand that something has just </v>
<v Speaker 1>transpired,</v>

514
00:30:28.211 --> 00:30:30.040
<v Speaker 1>that you're not allowed to share with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>

515
00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:35.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a model of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sophisticated enough to account </v>

516
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:35.620
<v Speaker 1>for all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then</v>

517
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.810
<v Speaker 1>perhaps from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is avoid thinking about it.</v>

518
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same as repression.</v>

519
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Avoiding thinking about something is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as repression because it </v>

520
00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 1>doesn't require an active repressor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to do it.</v>

521
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:55.110
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years later you start to recall what </v>

522
00:30:56.441 --> 00:31:01.441
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you recall is an unclear mess </v>

523
00:31:01.441 --> 00:31:04.150
<v Speaker 1>and the read and maybe most of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>

524
00:31:04.151 --> 00:31:09.151
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are things represented as memories </v>

525
00:31:09.151 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 1>when you can't develop a sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation and what seems to happen?</v>

526
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:16.291
<v Speaker 1>And this is in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason reversive Freudian theory is </v>

527
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:16.291
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

528
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:17.470
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

529
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.520
<v Speaker 1>event is represented in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can think about the </v>

530
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 1>representation of advantage as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>multilayered neurological phenomenon.</v>

531
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.860
<v Speaker 1>And so if you encounter something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected or frightening,</v>

532
00:31:32.861 --> 00:31:37.861
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very ancient reflex of systems act </v>

533
00:31:37.861 --> 00:31:39.520
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those things are fast.</v>

534
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the sort of thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

535
00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 1>might protect you against the snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>bite.</v>

536
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:46.330
<v Speaker 1>If a snake jumped out at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to jump backwards.</v>

537
00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:51.331
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that before you even see the </v>

538
00:31:51.331 --> 00:31:53.881
<v Speaker 1>snake because it takes you a quarter to </v>
<v Speaker 1>second to produce complex visual </v>

539
00:31:53.891 --> 00:31:58.891
<v Speaker 1>representation of the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you wait around for recorder for </v>

540
00:31:58.891 --> 00:31:58.940
<v Speaker 1>a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're dead.</v>

541
00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:04.140
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happened is that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system has conserved basic </v>

542
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 1>reflexes that are only a few synapses </v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

543
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:10.420
<v Speaker 1>so maybe those work between your retina </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your spinal cord,</v>

544
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.720
<v Speaker 1>your retina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe a very primordial emotional </v>

545
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.541
<v Speaker 1>system like the Amygdala is wired up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>detect things like snakes and it just </v>

546
00:32:18.541 --> 00:32:22.981
<v Speaker 1>sends a message down to your spinal cord</v>
<v Speaker 1>or or slightly more sophisticated motor </v>

547
00:32:22.981 --> 00:32:27.871
<v Speaker 1>control systems that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump backwards now and then maybe you </v>

548
00:32:27.871 --> 00:32:31.501
<v Speaker 1>think about it isn't even till after </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that your heart rate goes up and </v>

549
00:32:31.501 --> 00:32:35.401
<v Speaker 1>your blood pressure goes up and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to breathe heavily and then </v>

550
00:32:35.401 --> 00:32:38.761
<v Speaker 1>there's a wave of fear and revulsion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is perhaps there to teach you not </v>

551
00:32:38.761 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>to do such a stupid thing again.</v>

552
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:45.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't exactly know why you would </v>

553
00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:45.490
<v Speaker 1>experience negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

554
00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.180
<v Speaker 1>or what function the negative emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

555
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:52.420
<v Speaker 1>except that we do know that a pattern of</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological behavior that's followed by</v>

556
00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:57.521
<v Speaker 1>a punishment or a threat is likely less </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to be reimplemented in the </v>

557
00:32:58.761 --> 00:32:59.810
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

558
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:04.811
<v Speaker 1>So the reaction to the anomalous thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is broadly and then maybe it's emotion </v>

559
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:09.230
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe it's image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like imagination,</v>

560
00:33:09.231 --> 00:33:14.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what just happened and then maybe it's </v>

561
00:33:14.231 --> 00:33:16.331
<v Speaker 1>articulated speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but lots of things don't get past image </v>

562
00:33:16.331 --> 00:33:19.910
<v Speaker 1>to articulating speech and some things I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think don't even get past body.</v>

563
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Sorry about that.</v>

564
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:34.460
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that these traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories are so much repressed as Freud </v>

565
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:39.111
<v Speaker 1>had it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as never brought forward for </v>

566
00:33:39.111 --> 00:33:39.111
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

567
00:33:39.111 --> 00:33:39.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

568
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a story about how this </v>
<v Speaker 1>might work.</v>

569
00:33:41.971 --> 00:33:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one time I had this client,</v>

570
00:33:43.741 --> 00:33:45.810
<v Speaker 1>she was about 27.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only saw her once,</v>

571
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:50.610
<v Speaker 1>this is when I was training to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist and she came into me and</v>

572
00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:55.611
<v Speaker 1>she said that she had been plagued by </v>
<v Speaker 1>these thoughts of being sexually abused </v>

573
00:33:56.791 --> 00:33:59.160
<v Speaker 1>when she was a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

574
00:33:59.161 --> 00:34:01.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was doing this to you?</v>

575
00:34:01.471 --> 00:34:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

576
00:34:02.341 --> 00:34:03.740
<v Speaker 1>it was my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

577
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:09.020
<v Speaker 1>she said he was a lot older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I formulated this medical model </v>

578
00:34:09.361 --> 00:34:10.210
<v Speaker 1>of her being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

579
00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:15.290
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between 10 and 13 and her </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother being somewhere between say 15 </v>

580
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the way she described it was,</v>

581
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was overpowered by a larger,</v>

582
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:22.290
<v Speaker 1>a physically larger male.</v>

583
00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:25.620
<v Speaker 1>So we talked for awhile and then she </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally told me,</v>

584
00:34:25.621 --> 00:34:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

585
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:28.020
<v Speaker 1>how old were you when this happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

586
00:34:28.021 --> 00:34:30.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was for okay.</v>

587
00:34:30.091 --> 00:34:30.990
<v Speaker 1>And now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I said,</v>

588
00:34:30.991 --> 00:34:31.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

589
00:34:31.471 --> 00:34:34.020
<v Speaker 1>how old was your brother?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

590
00:34:34.021 --> 00:34:35.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was six.</v>

591
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.500
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

592
00:34:37.501 --> 00:34:39.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one way of looking at it,</v>

593
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.140
<v Speaker 1>like you're looking at it from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of the four year old.</v>

594
00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:48.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a regression in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's still how old you are as far as </v>

595
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.600
<v Speaker 1>experiencing the memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an alternative hypothesis.</v>

596
00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Your brother wasn't a predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were both terribly supervise </v>

597
00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.430
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

598
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that made the lights go on in your inner</v>

599
00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.730
<v Speaker 1>mind because she'd never thought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that way.</v>

600
00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Like she'd never taken that </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation,</v>

601
00:35:08.671 --> 00:35:12.780
<v Speaker 1>which would be her emotional experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a four year old related to a six year</v>

602
00:35:12.781 --> 00:35:12.900
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

603
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Six year old is a lot bigger and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful than four-year-olds.</v>

604
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's is,</v>

605
00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

606
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.960
<v Speaker 1>50 percent owner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a big deal when you're four.</v>

607
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.560
<v Speaker 1>But if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the issue for the memory is its </v>

608
00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.150
<v Speaker 1>relevance to current conceptualization </v>
<v Speaker 1>and behavior,</v>

609
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.350
<v Speaker 1>it was much better for her to update the</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory in a sense and think,</v>

610
00:35:34.351 --> 00:35:39.351
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a six year olds this and like the </v>

611
00:35:39.351 --> 00:35:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Oreos this high and like what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>were my parents doing anyways?</v>

612
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's an entirely different story </v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

613
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.010
<v Speaker 1>than the one that she had come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid come in with,</v>

614
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:52.040
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that seemed to be a great relief to </v>

615
00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:52.040
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because you know,</v>

616
00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.910
<v Speaker 1>if you're bothered by a traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>

617
00:35:53.911 --> 00:35:58.911
<v Speaker 1>it keeps resurfacing on which it will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's actually one of the ways of </v>

618
00:35:58.911 --> 00:36:01.710
<v Speaker 1>identifying a traumatic memory is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing won't leave you alone.</v>

619
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.450
<v Speaker 1>It keeps coming up and dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when your mind is wandering,</v>

620
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:10.460
<v Speaker 1>it'll keep coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When your mind is wandering and maybe </v>

621
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.520
<v Speaker 1>it'll come up when you're going to sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night and like it invades your mind.</v>

622
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:17.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason for that and the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>is is that the underlying emotional </v>

623
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.380
<v Speaker 1>systems that are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

624
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:24.530
<v Speaker 1>so those are mostly hippocampus and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a lot of dual duo in some sense </v>

625
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:29.631
<v Speaker 1>that are mediating those there an alarm </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and the alarm is something that's</v>

626
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:35.601
<v Speaker 1>potentially dangerous has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to figure out what it means so </v>

627
00:36:35.601 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 1>that you can stop that from happening in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

628
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you need a plan.</v>

629
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:43.190
<v Speaker 1>You need and get applied and you do have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a causal analysis of the </v>

630
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.840
<v Speaker 1>relationship between your behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the traumatic outcome.</v>

631
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.530
<v Speaker 1>That would be the first thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to come up with a way that that</v>

632
00:36:49.531 --> 00:36:50.580
<v Speaker 1>won't happen again.</v>

633
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:56.390
<v Speaker 1>And of course for my client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened pretty much right away </v>

634
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.620
<v Speaker 1>because now she was a 27 year old woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the probability that she was going to</v>

635
00:36:58.621 --> 00:37:02.790
<v Speaker 1>be subject in any serious way to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

636
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.210
<v Speaker 1>The same as the one she was remembering </v>
<v Speaker 1>was zero.</v>

637
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.780
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen this in other clients too,</v>

638
00:37:09.781 --> 00:37:11.190
<v Speaker 1>is when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're,</v>

639
00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:12.570
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

640
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I had another client who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

641
00:37:15.151 --> 00:37:16.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was,</v>

642
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I think I told you about her briefly </v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was young,</v>

643
00:37:19.921 --> 00:37:24.921
<v Speaker 1>four years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she jumped in a shopping cart and went </v>

644
00:37:24.921 --> 00:37:28.760
<v Speaker 1>down a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a paved hail in the shopping cart </v>

645
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.411
<v Speaker 1>and spilled out at the bottom and hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>herself and they took her to the </v>

646
00:37:31.411 --> 00:37:31.411
<v Speaker 1>hospital and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

647
00:37:31.411 --> 00:37:33.780
<v Speaker 1>so then she's all primed for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened and men.</v>

648
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.520
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of means you're open to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewire reading some sense in this.</v>

649
00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.520
<v Speaker 1>So then when she's in the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't let her parents come and see </v>

650
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:42.520
<v Speaker 1>her for a couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:47.091
<v Speaker 1>so the trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain and the anxiety and the threat </v>

652
00:37:47.091 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 1>than the ambulance ride and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

653
00:37:48.031 --> 00:37:50.460
<v Speaker 1>which sort of puts her in a state like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

654
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.060
<v Speaker 1>which might be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

655
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:55.740
<v Speaker 1>a state that's particular to conducive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learning.</v>

656
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.340
<v Speaker 1>If something traumatic is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be learning about that.</v>

657
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.230
<v Speaker 1>What the world's like around that right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

658
00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:06.890
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she developed at a permanent trauma </v>

659
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:10.140
<v Speaker 1>related paranoia about institutions </v>
<v Speaker 1>which turned by the time I met her,</v>

660
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:14.280
<v Speaker 1>had turned into a whole philosophy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutional oppression,</v>

661
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's core was that Tara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rightly so,</v>

662
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it's core was that combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological trauma and psychological </v>

663
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:27.741
<v Speaker 1>trauma and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miss handling of the situation by people</v>

664
00:38:28.021 --> 00:38:29.890
<v Speaker 1>in authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

665
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:36.060
<v Speaker 1>so you can see under those circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 1>how a traumatic memory can become the </v>

666
00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.300
<v Speaker 1>core of a whole large subpersonality.</v>

667
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Now it has to be taken apart very </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>

668
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:45.090
<v Speaker 1>especially if that subpersonality isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind that can be easily integrated </v>

669
00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:46.360
<v Speaker 1>into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

670
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're paranoid about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>

671
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you're in real trouble because in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern world you're faced with the </v>

672
00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.240
<v Speaker 1>necessity of dealing with institutions </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

673
00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And if you're more distrustful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid about them,</v>

674
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 1>then you couldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were sophisticated,</v>

675
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:05.470
<v Speaker 1>all of it's going to happen is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to continually mistreat you,</v>

676
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:06.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean,</v>

677
00:39:06.401 --> 00:39:11.401
<v Speaker 1>if a dog comes up to you and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's looking suspiciously and barking </v>

678
00:39:11.401 --> 00:39:12.100
<v Speaker 1>and growling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to pet it.</v>

679
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:17.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you interact with the system is </v>

680
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:21.390
<v Speaker 1>depends the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reaction of a system to you is </v>

681
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.080
<v Speaker 1>dependent to a large degree on how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach the system.</v>

682
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.270
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dissociate ability ideas,</v>

683
00:39:26.271 --> 00:39:27.100
<v Speaker 1>they're really good one.</v>

684
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

685
00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.420
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get to know yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

686
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.480
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday and in union ideas,</v>

687
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:40.870
<v Speaker 1>one of the things to do is to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you have some sort of </v>

688
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:42.290
<v Speaker 1>goal in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first question is you that you might</v>

689
00:39:42.291 --> 00:39:45.470
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself is why do you have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal?</v>

690
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.950
<v Speaker 1>What are the influences on you that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>set that goal up?</v>

691
00:39:48.951 --> 00:39:53.951
<v Speaker 1>Because it easily could be conscious or </v>
<v Speaker 1>partially conscious or poorly explained </v>

692
00:39:55.131 --> 00:40:00.131
<v Speaker 1>or implicit any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to know that why are you </v>

693
00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:00.440
<v Speaker 1>doing what you're doing?</v>

694
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.500
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing is if you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself avoiding things on the way to </v>

695
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:12.571
<v Speaker 1>that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next question is why are you </v>

696
00:40:12.571 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 1>avoiding them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

697
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:16.360
<v Speaker 1>that'll mean delving into parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that are quite hidden and quite</v>

698
00:40:16.361 --> 00:40:17.860
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

699
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:23.280
<v Speaker 1>if you discover that the reason you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing a particular goal is because </v>

700
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.780
<v Speaker 1>it's what your parents want you to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one question that immediately arises,</v>

701
00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 1>rises is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

702
00:40:29.111 --> 00:40:34.111
<v Speaker 1>but is that what you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know that that's a very </v>

703
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 1>complicated question because you'd have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to dissociate the part of you that's the</v>

704
00:40:38.981 --> 00:40:43.981
<v Speaker 1>you that doesn't want to do it from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of you that's the you that does </v>

705
00:40:43.981 --> 00:40:47.821
<v Speaker 1>want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to figure out why in </v>

706
00:40:47.821 --> 00:40:50.611
<v Speaker 1>the world you'd be avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know it might be that you're an </v>

707
00:40:50.611 --> 00:40:53.490
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably angry that you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>tilted towards this particular goal for </v>

708
00:40:54.131 --> 00:40:59.131
<v Speaker 1>reasons that have nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your choice and so that every time you </v>

709
00:40:59.131 --> 00:41:03.631
<v Speaker 1>have the opportunity to study or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or accomplish something that would move </v>

710
00:41:03.631 --> 00:41:06.910
<v Speaker 1>you farther to that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're either not motivated.</v>

711
00:41:06.911 --> 00:41:09.040
<v Speaker 1>So you can't pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't study,</v>

712
00:41:09.041 --> 00:41:14.041
<v Speaker 1>you can't learn and you procrastinate </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time or you actually do </v>

713
00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:15.970
<v Speaker 1>seriously counterproductive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>

714
00:41:15.971 --> 00:41:17.950
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can be.</v>

715
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I just had someone write me here a while</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago because he was watching the youtube </v>

716
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.990
<v Speaker 1>lectures and he said that he had dreams </v>
<v Speaker 1>for six weeks,</v>

717
00:41:27.991 --> 00:41:31.170
<v Speaker 1>that he drove his car off a cliff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crashed it,</v>

718
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 1>and then at the end of the series he </v>
<v Speaker 1>drove his car off the cliff and crashed </v>

719
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.090
<v Speaker 1>it and he asked me what that meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

720
00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:43.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream is telling you that you're </v>

721
00:41:43.091 --> 00:41:45.191
<v Speaker 1>being far too careless with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe that's what driving a cliff </v>

722
00:41:45.191 --> 00:41:48.680
<v Speaker 1>off a car off a cliff repeatedly needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know,</v>

723
00:41:48.681 --> 00:41:52.190
<v Speaker 1>that's a good descent unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>descent into the underworld.</v>

724
00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was being warned.</v>

725
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 1>The psychological reality was such that</v>

726
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.720
<v Speaker 1>the warning was extremely serious and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the danger.</v>

727
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:03.780
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

728
00:42:03.781 --> 00:42:06.150
<v Speaker 1>why would he drive himself off a cliff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

729
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a suicidal gesture.</v>

730
00:42:08.371 --> 00:42:09.240
<v Speaker 1>And then you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

731
00:42:09.241 --> 00:42:11.640
<v Speaker 1>why would somebody be suicidal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that could be,</v>

732
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're out for revenge against their </v>

733
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 1>parents or they're out for revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the whole world or the route for</v>

734
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.711
<v Speaker 1>revenge against themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they just want to make their painful </v>

735
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:24.951
<v Speaker 1>consciousness go away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're living a messy and pointless </v>

736
00:42:24.951 --> 00:42:28.970
<v Speaker 1>and painful life and and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>punish themselves for it and you know </v>

737
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.780
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated and tangled down there </v>

738
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.991
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of things and people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really like to look into it and I </v>

739
00:42:35.991 --> 00:42:39.651
<v Speaker 1>suppose to some degree that's the shadow</v>
<v Speaker 1>element because what you find there is </v>

740
00:42:39.651 --> 00:42:44.541
<v Speaker 1>seldom what you want in one of the prime</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictums of union psychotherapy and most </v>

741
00:42:46.771 --> 00:42:51.771
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapies are predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that you should find out what </v>

742
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:53.520
<v Speaker 1>you're avoiding and then you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to voluntarily face it.</v>

743
00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Now you might add to that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what you're doing and why and </v>

744
00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:03.171
<v Speaker 1>see if that's actually what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be doing and if those reasons are </v>

745
00:43:03.171 --> 00:43:04.800
<v Speaker 1>reasons you like that might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

746
00:43:04.801 --> 00:43:07.530
<v Speaker 1>in some sense some up therapy in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of phrases,</v>

747
00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:08.370
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

748
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.520
<v Speaker 1>in order to manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to look at all the things </v>

749
00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:15.520
<v Speaker 1>you've been avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

750
00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.370
<v Speaker 1>what do you avoid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

751
00:43:16.371 --> 00:43:18.440
<v Speaker 1>it isn't rainbows and cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

752
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:22.550
<v Speaker 1>The things that you avoid are the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one wants to look at,</v>

753
00:43:22.551 --> 00:43:27.551
<v Speaker 1>and so your primary dictum for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic practice was a Latin </v>

754
00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:30.890
<v Speaker 1>phrase which is in sterk wiliness </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite tour,</v>

755
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.040
<v Speaker 1>which I'm probably pronouncing wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means either in filth it will be </v>

756
00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:40.661
<v Speaker 1>found or where are you want most is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be found where you least want to look.</v>

757
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:42.860
<v Speaker 1>You know when those are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that.</v>

758
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:47.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a horrible philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can see that it's almost self.</v>

759
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.070
<v Speaker 1>It's almost self fulfilling because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course the things you're going to avoid.</v>

760
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Are there things that you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face?</v>

761
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Obviously now the shadow element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche in some sense when you were </v>

762
00:43:59.691 --> 00:44:04.691
<v Speaker 1>watching the movie for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw these drives mostly sexual and </v>

763
00:44:04.971 --> 00:44:09.971
<v Speaker 1>aggressive that were manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in all sorts of ways and so </v>

764
00:44:09.971 --> 00:44:12.140
<v Speaker 1>that would be maybe the repressed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>unincorporated elements of the Ed,</v>

765
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:17.320
<v Speaker 1>but then there was a side of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was another more complex side of </v>

766
00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.060
<v Speaker 1>that where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

767
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people were reacting to that,</v>

768
00:44:22.071 --> 00:44:27.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they felt downtrodden and </v>

769
00:44:27.071 --> 00:44:29.110
<v Speaker 1>oppressed and and antisocial and </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical of social structure.</v>

770
00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:34.301
<v Speaker 1>And all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were unable to manifest </v>

771
00:44:34.301 --> 00:44:38.271
<v Speaker 1>themselves properly in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that produced fantasies of extreme </v>

772
00:44:38.271 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 1>destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptional destruction for them.</v>

773
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:45.261
<v Speaker 1>They were mostly sexually related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for other people that can manifest </v>

774
00:44:45.261 --> 00:44:49.431
<v Speaker 1>itself in incredibly violent fantasies </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the destruction of society as </v>

775
00:44:49.431 --> 00:44:49.740
<v Speaker 1>such.</v>

776
00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:51.100
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

777
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.040
<v Speaker 1>if you can invite all the parts of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to play,</v>

778
00:44:55.041 --> 00:45:00.041
<v Speaker 1>the parts that get left behind are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy about it and they don't just </v>

779
00:45:00.041 --> 00:45:01.040
<v Speaker 1>sit around having a tea party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

780
00:45:01.041 --> 00:45:02.410
<v Speaker 1>they turn into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turn it into,</v>

781
00:45:02.411 --> 00:45:06.680
<v Speaker 1>especially as you mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turn into these worked monsters and</v>

782
00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:11.740
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mode of action in the world is </v>

783
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.950
<v Speaker 1>anything but positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Freudian world and the world of </v>

784
00:45:16.641 --> 00:45:21.641
<v Speaker 1>the psychoanalytic unconscious is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrifying place because it makes you </v>

785
00:45:21.741 --> 00:45:25.220
<v Speaker 1>second guess everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not a paranoia out.</v>

786
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

787
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.030
<v Speaker 1>You never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

788
00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:35.031
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you're trained psychoanalytically </v>

789
00:45:35.031 --> 00:45:38.241
<v Speaker 1>to ever assume that someone's benevolent</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations are only what they claim </v>

790
00:45:39.481 --> 00:45:44.481
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always looking for the other </v>

791
00:45:44.481 --> 00:45:44.481
<v Speaker 1>missing piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

792
00:45:44.481 --> 00:45:45.870
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's extremely useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

793
00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:50.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you run into people particularity </v>

794
00:45:50.871 --> 00:45:51.750
<v Speaker 1>ideologues who will claim that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting on the world's behalf.</v>

795
00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

796
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:59.900
<v Speaker 1>who made us sane and why should I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that all the good is on your </v>

797
00:45:59.900 --> 00:45:59.900
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

798
00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.590
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you're not talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

799
00:46:01.591 --> 00:46:04.650
<v Speaker 1>What it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you're not revealing?</v>

800
00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I got something from Greenpeace once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

801
00:46:07.321 --> 00:46:12.321
<v Speaker 1>that was asking for donations and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brochure was just photographs of all the</v>

802
00:46:12.811 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 1>people who were on the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

803
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:22.660
<v Speaker 1>why do I want to see photographs of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who are on the board of </v>

804
00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:26.171
<v Speaker 1>Greenpeace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the other question is why do they </v>

805
00:46:26.171 --> 00:46:26.171
<v Speaker 1>want to show them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

806
00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.460
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to faint very hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that out.</v>

807
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a status maneuver,</v>

808
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:33.470
<v Speaker 1>what you'd expected to mail out like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as you know,</v>

809
00:46:33.471 --> 00:46:38.471
<v Speaker 1>here's six things that we've done in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year that improve the planet and </v>

810
00:46:38.471 --> 00:46:42.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we spent in relationship to </v>

811
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:44.630
<v Speaker 1>administrative costs and here's why it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a good idea or not,</v>

812
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:48.770
<v Speaker 1>here's our leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's something wrong there.</v>

813
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:53.810
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I picked Greenpeace because it just </v>

814
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.051
<v Speaker 1>happened to pop in money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the case for all sorts of of </v>

815
00:46:56.051 --> 00:46:56.051
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

816
00:46:56.051 --> 00:46:59.620
<v Speaker 3>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

817
00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:04.950
<v Speaker 1>freud by 1900 had identified a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different functions of the unconscious </v>

818
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:08.110
<v Speaker 1>and so here's four of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was the unconscious,</v>

819
00:47:08.111 --> 00:47:13.111
<v Speaker 1>how to conservative function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant that it stored memories </v>

820
00:47:13.111 --> 00:47:16.920
<v Speaker 1>often unaccessible to voluntary recall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't really know how memories </v>

821
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.100
<v Speaker 1>are stored in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's,</v>

822
00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:22.510
<v Speaker 1>here's a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have an experience,</v>

823
00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:27.540
<v Speaker 1>imagine that that produces a pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neural activity.</v>

824
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:33.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not just neuro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a pattern of activity in your brain </v>

825
00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.841
<v Speaker 1>and in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least part of how you remember it is </v>

826
00:47:38.651 --> 00:47:43.651
<v Speaker 1>to reactivate that pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that simple obviously </v>

827
00:47:43.651 --> 00:47:47.221
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you docked out all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your memories precisely and we don't </v>

828
00:47:47.221 --> 00:47:48.940
<v Speaker 1>know exactly how that initial</v>

829
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.170
<v Speaker 1>pattern of experienced gets edited down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the thing you remember.</v>

830
00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:59.171
<v Speaker 1>But we do know that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets edited down in some ways as a </v>

831
00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:02.000
<v Speaker 1>consequence of its relevance to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current goal structure.</v>

832
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:06.680
<v Speaker 1>How that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems computationally impossible.</v>

833
00:48:06.681 --> 00:48:08.900
<v Speaker 1>We really don't understand how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens at all.</v>

834
00:48:08.901 --> 00:48:13.250
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand how you can compute </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's relevant and what isn't.</v>

835
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:17.540
<v Speaker 1>It seems that the world is too complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that to even be possible.</v>

836
00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:23.260
<v Speaker 1>So Conservative dissoluted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious contains habits once </v>

837
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:26.600
<v Speaker 1>voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now automatized and dissociated elements</v>

838
00:48:26.601 --> 00:48:29.630
<v Speaker 1>of the personality which may lead a </v>
<v Speaker 1>parasitic existence.</v>

839
00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:35.020
<v Speaker 1>That's so I talked to a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic memories and how they might </v>

840
00:48:35.271 --> 00:48:37.720
<v Speaker 1>form the node of the development of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality,</v>

841
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.610
<v Speaker 1>but there's something else that's worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding too.</v>

842
00:48:40.611 --> 00:48:45.611
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You start practicing a new minor mode of</v>

843
00:48:47.001 --> 00:48:50.270
<v Speaker 1>being a new attitude or a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality attribute or new habit.</v>

844
00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it can be a fairly small </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

845
00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.940
<v Speaker 1>When you first start practicing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not very good at it.</v>

846
00:48:55.970 --> 00:49:00.970
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who are musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you first start to play a </v>

847
00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:04.271
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very inefficient at it and then </v>

848
00:49:04.271 --> 00:49:04.740
<v Speaker 1>the more you practice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more efficient you get it.</v>

849
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.100
<v Speaker 1>It's quite weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a very good pianist,</v>

850
00:49:07.101 --> 00:49:09.200
<v Speaker 1>but I learned to play one really </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult song,</v>

851
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:14.500
<v Speaker 1>but the terrible thing is is I'll learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>to play it and then at some point I'll </v>

852
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:17.981
<v Speaker 1>realize that I don't know the notes </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and as soon as I realized I </v>

853
00:49:17.981 --> 00:49:18.890
<v Speaker 1>don't know the notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't use those habit patterns anymore</v>

854
00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:20.510
<v Speaker 1>and then I have to figure out the notes </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

855
00:49:20.511 --> 00:49:21.680
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very annoying,</v>

856
00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:27.070
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first start practicing </v>

857
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:27.070
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's effortful.</v>

858
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:30.020
<v Speaker 1>It requires a lot of brain activation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the scanning studies show,</v>

859
00:49:30.021 --> 00:49:35.021
<v Speaker 1>but as you practice it more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of the brain that you use </v>

860
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:35.450
<v Speaker 1>starts to shrink.</v>

861
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:40.530
<v Speaker 1>It generally moves left because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right hemisphere is more involved in </v>

862
00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:44.201
<v Speaker 1>novelty processing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It generally moves left and then it </v>

863
00:49:44.201 --> 00:49:47.051
<v Speaker 1>moves back and the area gets smaller and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller and smaller until you generate </v>

864
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:50.930
<v Speaker 1>it up a little machine or it's a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard wired.</v>

865
00:49:50.931 --> 00:49:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Some personality that takes care of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular operation.</v>

866
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Now that's where thinking about too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what that means in some senses </v>

867
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.071
<v Speaker 1>that your brain is full of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've practiced and that's not </v>

868
00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:07.430
<v Speaker 1>exactly psychological right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's psychophysiological,</v>

869
00:50:07.431 --> 00:50:10.430
<v Speaker 1>it's part of your psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also hardwired into your brain.</v>

870
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.410
<v Speaker 1>If you want to overcome one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>habits,</v>

871
00:50:12.411 --> 00:50:14.840
<v Speaker 1>you have to build a new machine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shuts it off.</v>

872
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.750
<v Speaker 1>You can't just get rid of it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

873
00:50:17.751 --> 00:50:20.090
<v Speaker 1>If you get stressed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often that new machine will get,</v>

874
00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly how it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stress will reduce the functioning,</v>

875
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.360
<v Speaker 1>the new machine and old habit to pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>back up.</v>

876
00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Some of you will have noticed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have moved away from </v>

877
00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.900
<v Speaker 1>home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

878
00:50:35.901 --> 00:50:40.790
<v Speaker 1>so how many of you know this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go to your family of origin,</v>

879
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:45.820
<v Speaker 1>origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all sorts of personality traits </v>

880
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:48.740
<v Speaker 1>that you thought you abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately come flooding back.</v>

881
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.870
<v Speaker 1>So are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

882
00:50:50.871 --> 00:50:52.250
<v Speaker 1>you know that sensation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

883
00:50:52.251 --> 00:50:57.251
<v Speaker 1>You go back there and it's like bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a groove and you're right in it </v>

884
00:50:57.251 --> 00:51:00.221
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're as mature as a 30 year old </v>

885
00:51:00.221 --> 00:51:03.521
<v Speaker 1>when you're at your own house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as you come home it's like </v>

886
00:51:03.521 --> 00:51:03.521
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 14 again.</v>

887
00:51:03.521 --> 00:51:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectancy situation set up by your </v>

888
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:11.111
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also partly because you just </v>

889
00:51:11.111 --> 00:51:13.691
<v Speaker 1>don't understand how much of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior is automatic and cued by </v>

890
00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.010
<v Speaker 1>ongoing you best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's habitual.</v>

891
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.400
<v Speaker 1>And so those you might think of those as</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat dissociated elements of the </v>

892
00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.120
<v Speaker 1>personality as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creative.</v>

893
00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:27.680
<v Speaker 1>The unconscious serves as the Matrix of </v>
<v Speaker 1>new ideas.</v>

894
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's a more union idea and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to work,</v>

895
00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in the world can you come up with a </v>

896
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.170
<v Speaker 1>new idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense,</v>

897
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

898
00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.600
<v Speaker 1>what are you conjuring something out of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

899
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>

900
00:51:45.091 --> 00:51:47.340
<v Speaker 1>well they're combinations of old ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

901
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:50.370
<v Speaker 1>that's not that helpful because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't just take a bunch of old ideas and</v>

902
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:53.820
<v Speaker 1>shuffled them and come up with some new </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular ideas.</v>

903
00:51:53.821 --> 00:51:58.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot more complicated than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's one way to think about</v>

904
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigated in some sense,</v>

905
00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:07.430
<v Speaker 1>the surface of the creative unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was more concerned about the.</v>

906
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:11.780
<v Speaker 1>He don't call Freud's unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal unconscious.</v>

907
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:16.990
<v Speaker 1>So that might be the unconscious that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have that's related specifically to </v>

908
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:19.040
<v Speaker 1>your experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious and unconscious,</v>

909
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:21.380
<v Speaker 1>like it can be deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a dream once,</v>

910
00:52:21.381 --> 00:52:26.381
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope I've got this right that Freud and </v>

911
00:52:26.381 --> 00:52:31.151
<v Speaker 1>him were excavating the basement of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and that and then he broke </v>

912
00:52:31.161 --> 00:52:36.161
<v Speaker 1>through and found another huge structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath that and that's just about </v>

913
00:52:36.161 --> 00:52:39.821
<v Speaker 1>exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's the personal unconscious </v>

914
00:52:39.821 --> 00:52:43.391
<v Speaker 1>and then underneath that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in theory there's what you called the </v>

915
00:52:43.391 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 1>collective unconscious and that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows what that is,</v>

916
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:50.381
<v Speaker 1>but in part what it would be is whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that makes you human from an </v>

917
00:52:50.381 --> 00:52:55.361
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary perspective and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know like you have a specific mode of </v>

918
00:52:55.361 --> 00:52:57.590
<v Speaker 1>being that's a human mode of big.</v>

919
00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Eo Wilson who's a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>entomologist and also the originator of </v>

920
00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:11.320
<v Speaker 1>sociobiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a branch of evolutionary </v>

921
00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:14.471
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He studied dance forever and social </v>

922
00:53:14.471 --> 00:53:18.671
<v Speaker 1>behavior of ants and he's sad if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can talk to and we wouldn't have </v>

923
00:53:20.391 --> 00:53:25.391
<v Speaker 1>anything to say to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he meant by that is that like </v>

924
00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.650
<v Speaker 1>interested in a bunch of things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't care about at all.</v>

925
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get jealous,</v>

926
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:36.440
<v Speaker 1>they don't fall in love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have sexual feelings or </v>

927
00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:39.090
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not a cognitive creature.</v>

928
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:44.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you going to talk </v>

929
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.150
<v Speaker 1>through now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about how it's,</v>

930
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160
<v Speaker 1>how is it going and carrying that grain </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sand.</v>

931
00:53:44.161 --> 00:53:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like an aunt as an impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even care about that.</v>

932
00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And so it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a profound observation </v>

933
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:55.551
<v Speaker 1>because what it indicates is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even communicate with someone </v>

934
00:53:55.551 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 1>unless you were 99 percent the same as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

935
00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Because to communicate with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>means you have to share a whole massive,</v>

936
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:06.480
<v Speaker 1>immense set of presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

937
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:11.810
<v Speaker 1>if I say I got jealous at a party last </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

938
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:15.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to say,</v>

939
00:54:15.841 --> 00:54:18.720
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean jealous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't going to be your question.</v>

940
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:19.560
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

941
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:23.760
<v Speaker 1>what were their particular circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 1>that elicited that response?</v>

942
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to explain anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to explain playfulness,</v>

943
00:54:27.841 --> 00:54:28.830
<v Speaker 1>hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

944
00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the basic human motivations that you</v>

945
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:36.081
<v Speaker 1>see displayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in the typical adventure movie or </v>

946
00:54:36.081 --> 00:54:38.601
<v Speaker 1>romantic comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like those don't need explanation </v>

947
00:54:38.601 --> 00:54:41.721
<v Speaker 1>because we're the same and it's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sameness that constitutes the essence of</v>

948
00:54:43.141 --> 00:54:48.141
<v Speaker 1>the collective unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now yeomans hypothesis was that you're </v>

949
00:54:48.141 --> 00:54:52.551
<v Speaker 1>not only biologically structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know in terms of your morphology of </v>

950
00:54:53.671 --> 00:54:56.160
<v Speaker 1>your physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that that extends right up into your</v>

951
00:54:56.161 --> 00:54:59.370
<v Speaker 1>brain structure and even above that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the contents.</v>

952
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Either the contents of your psyche or at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least into the way that your psyche </v>

953
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:07.680
<v Speaker 1>becomes organized across time and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

954
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:13.070
<v Speaker 1>it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a hypothesis that's so </v>

955
00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:16.041
<v Speaker 1>bloody obvious that you can't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people would have disputed it for </v>

956
00:55:16.041 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 1>so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but experimental psychologists were very</v>

957
00:55:17.701 --> 00:55:22.701
<v Speaker 1>strongly influenced by behaviorists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the behaviorist assumed partly through </v>

958
00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:29.440
<v Speaker 1>the illogical reasons and partly for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sake of scientific simplicity that human</v>

959
00:55:29.791 --> 00:55:33.600
<v Speaker 1>beings were blank slates and that all we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were was what we learned.</v>

960
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a book out now called human </v>

961
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:40.560
<v Speaker 1>universals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm unfortunately,</v>

962
00:55:40.561 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the name of the author </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

963
00:55:42.601 --> 00:55:47.601
<v Speaker 1>but it's a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a work of sociology slash </v>

964
00:55:47.601 --> 00:55:50.330
<v Speaker 1>anthropology and this person has </v>
<v Speaker 1>collected human commonality,</v>

965
00:55:50.331 --> 00:55:52.950
<v Speaker 1>so what's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the same about people everywhere?</v>

966
00:55:52.951 --> 00:55:57.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pretty much all were close sometimes </v>

967
00:55:57.951 --> 00:55:58.830
<v Speaker 1>for protective purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if not generally,</v>

968
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:02.820
<v Speaker 1>at least for ceremonial purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's pair bonding in societies.</v>

969
00:56:02.821 --> 00:56:05.670
<v Speaker 1>People Fall in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The basic emotions are the same.</v>

970
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:08.610
<v Speaker 1>We use fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal,</v>

971
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because no other animal can manage that.</v>

972
00:56:11.041 --> 00:56:16.041
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's literally dozens and dozens of </v>

973
00:56:16.041 --> 00:56:18.950
<v Speaker 1>universal commonalities across people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the substructure of </v>

974
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:21.390
<v Speaker 1>the collective unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

975
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:25.240
<v Speaker 1>back to the creative idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

976
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:30.900
<v Speaker 1>partly your creative act is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of your attempts to </v>

977
00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:35.341
<v Speaker 1>integrate the peculiarities of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience with the peculiarities of </v>

978
00:56:36.611 --> 00:56:40.000
<v Speaker 1>your culture and this and that more </v>
<v Speaker 1>general</v>

979
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon states of being that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>share with other people.</v>

980
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:50.050
<v Speaker 1>So because you come into the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have your own viewpoint,</v>

981
00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you're you have access to information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no other person has access to and </v>

982
00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:58.600
<v Speaker 1>so to some degree that can be the basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your creativity.</v>

983
00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Just that information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then in order to communicate it,</v>

984
00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:05.110
<v Speaker 1>which is also part of being creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

985
00:57:05.111 --> 00:57:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't just be creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one can understand you.</v>

986
00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.320
<v Speaker 1>It's more like you're schizophrenic than</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your creative,</v>

987
00:57:11.321 --> 00:57:16.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have loose associations and so </v>

988
00:57:16.321 --> 00:57:18.571
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you cannot put together a coherent </v>

989
00:57:18.571 --> 00:57:20.431
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you have to take that unique </v>

990
00:57:20.431 --> 00:57:21.400
<v Speaker 1>information and integrate it with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural knowledge,</v>

991
00:57:21.401 --> 00:57:25.180
<v Speaker 1>your cultural narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grounded in universal human biology,</v>

992
00:57:25.181 --> 00:57:27.550
<v Speaker 1>and then you can present that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative act.</v>

993
00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:28.610
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

994
00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:34.710
<v Speaker 1>that's one possible place for the origin</v>
<v Speaker 1>of new ideas,</v>

995
00:57:34.711 --> 00:57:35.700
<v Speaker 1>but here's another.</v>

996
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:37.260
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

997
00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:43.420
<v Speaker 1>remember we talked about piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget basically said that to begin to </v>

998
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.840
<v Speaker 1>understand something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you acted out so you represent the world</v>

999
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:49.300
<v Speaker 1>with your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by sitting on a chair.</v>

1000
00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:52.730
<v Speaker 1>You represent the chair with your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by walking through a doorway.</v>

1001
00:57:52.731 --> 00:57:54.530
<v Speaker 1>You represent the doorway with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

1002
00:57:54.531 --> 00:57:57.320
<v Speaker 1>By grabbing that glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the same thing,</v>

1003
00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:00.590
<v Speaker 1>so you're matching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're imitating the world all the time,</v>

1004
00:58:00.591 --> 00:58:03.290
<v Speaker 1>so you're mapping it onto your </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological structure.</v>

1005
00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.930
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you get a sense.</v>

1006
00:58:05.931 --> 00:58:08.900
<v Speaker 1>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of what understanding means.</v>

1007
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:14.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's a complex term to sort </v>

1008
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:16.301
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand what does it mean to </v>

1009
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:18.041
<v Speaker 1>understand something means to get a grip</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it and we use those terms for a </v>

1010
00:58:18.471 --> 00:58:19.910
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to be,</v>

1011
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:25.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're standing firmly in relationship </v>

1012
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.880
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can handle it all of those things.</v>

1013
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:27.440
<v Speaker 1>So that's one.</v>

1014
00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:33.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then also you're capable of </v>

1015
00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:36.281
<v Speaker 1>imitating so you can imitate yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do when you repeat </v>

1016
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:39.890
<v Speaker 1>experiences that had a positive outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also imitate other people.</v>

1017
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1018
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:44.210
<v Speaker 1>well who are those people imitating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1019
00:58:44.211 --> 00:58:49.211
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is it's like we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>led screens and we're constantly </v>

1020
00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:55.280
<v Speaker 1>revealing imitations of imitations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of invitations,</v>

1021
00:58:55.281 --> 00:59:00.140
<v Speaker 1>of invitations across our physiological </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>

1022
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys are the sum total of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very long evolutionary process,</v>

1023
00:59:04.701 --> 00:59:09.530
<v Speaker 1>but you're also the sum total of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly long process of mimicry.</v>

1024
00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:14.300
<v Speaker 1>And so what you mimic is your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can think of your culture.</v>

1025
00:59:14.301 --> 00:59:19.301
<v Speaker 1>It's something with a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's complex personality and the </v>

1026
00:59:19.301 --> 00:59:20.960
<v Speaker 1>personality of your ancestors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly reasonable way of looking at.</v>

1027
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.400
<v Speaker 1>And you imitate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1028
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:28.220
<v Speaker 1>that's why we call our our laws of body </v>
<v Speaker 1>of laws,</v>

1029
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:31.820
<v Speaker 1>and you could say that the legal system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with English common law,</v>

1030
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:37.060
<v Speaker 1>is the articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated representation of the </v>

1031
00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:39.530
<v Speaker 1>imitative customs and rituals of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire society.</v>

1032
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:42.050
<v Speaker 1>It's been brought right up into full </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulation,</v>

1033
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:47.290
<v Speaker 1>but it was there to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so part of where you draw your,</v>

1034
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your material for creativity is that you</v>

1035
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:59.441
<v Speaker 1>observed the behaviors and interactions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all people who've been imitating all </v>

1036
00:59:59.441 --> 01:00:02.930
<v Speaker 1>people since the beginning of time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unbelievably informative.</v>

1037
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.780
<v Speaker 1>It's way more informative than you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever represent.</v>

1038
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:10.960
<v Speaker 1>You know how much information someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>can indicate with just lifting your </v>

1039
01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.780
<v Speaker 1>eyebrow a quarter of an inch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1040
01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:16.781
<v Speaker 1>That can indicate irony in it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate the relationship of a joke to </v>

1041
01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:20.231
<v Speaker 1>another set of jokes that that person </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows that you liked and it's very </v>

1042
01:00:20.231 --> 01:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't articulate all that,</v>

1043
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.270
<v Speaker 1>but in some sense you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1044
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.090
<v Speaker 1>You're a player in that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1045
01:00:26.091 --> 01:00:28.160
<v Speaker 1>now and then so then imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1046
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>you've got all that embodied to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that you're a sophisticated </v>

1047
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:36.851
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your imagination is representing </v>

1048
01:00:36.851 --> 01:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>you and it's representing the world.</v>

1049
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>So that's an abstraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1050
01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Because your imagination is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1051
01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a representation of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you can do.</v>

1052
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>So that means in the imagination there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of information that's about </v>

1053
01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:54.641
<v Speaker 1>the imitative behavior and then then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can talk about the image.</v>

1054
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of what you do when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret a dream.</v>

1055
01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>So what's your dream doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your imagination is watching.</v>

1056
01:01:00.651 --> 01:01:05.651
<v Speaker 1>You wandered around in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you have your category </v>

1057
01:01:05.651 --> 01:01:08.991
<v Speaker 1>systems and your theories and so forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then the dream puts forth what </v>

1058
01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:13.901
<v Speaker 1>that like an image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an image istick representation of what </v>

1059
01:01:13.901 --> 01:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>that might signify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's in this weird language which is</v>

1060
01:01:16.361 --> 01:01:18.860
<v Speaker 1>an image,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an image laden language.</v>

1061
01:01:18.861 --> 01:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>It can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can range from completely incoherent,</v>

1062
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:26.360
<v Speaker 1>just juxtaposed images to unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex and sophisticated,</v>

1063
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:31.600
<v Speaker 1>full develop narratives and that's part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the process by which the information </v>

1064
01:01:31.881 --> 01:01:36.881
<v Speaker 1>that's embedded in you and the culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a behavioral level moves up to the </v>

1065
01:01:36.881 --> 01:01:40.790
<v Speaker 1>imagination and then pops up into </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated space so you have a dream.</v>

1066
01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>The dream is about you and then you talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the dream and what you're doing.</v>

1067
01:01:44.931 --> 01:01:49.931
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to translate the images </v>
<v Speaker 1>into articulated representations and </v>

1068
01:01:49.931 --> 01:01:54.731
<v Speaker 1>that's also a good way of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how memory moves from the bottom up and </v>

1069
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1070
01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have a realization or a </v>

1071
01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>moment of insight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 1>and that there's a feeling that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with that.</v>

1073
01:02:04.281 --> 01:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like a charge and I think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge that you get from,</v>

1074
01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:13.400
<v Speaker 1>from simplifying something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also from experiencing the new </v>

1075
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>possibilities that emerge as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that realization.</v>

1076
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>What seems to happen is that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral realm,</v>

1077
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>let's say the things you act out and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you imitates very,</v>

1078
01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>very complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>

1079
01:02:26.221 --> 01:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>you have the image of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1080
01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>And you're trying to get the image </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1081
01:02:30.091 --> 01:02:35.091
<v Speaker 1>but it's really hard because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes in this floats around so you're </v>

1082
01:02:35.091 --> 01:02:38.721
<v Speaker 1>trying to get those lined up and then on</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of that you're trying to get your </v>

1083
01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>articulated representations lined up so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can say what you know about who</v>

1084
01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:44.280
<v Speaker 1>you are and when all those come together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

1085
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got my act together,</v>

1086
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:47.760
<v Speaker 1>but now and then you'll have an insight.</v>

1087
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll think,</v>

1088
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this woman who who I told you about</v>

1089
01:02:51.451 --> 01:02:56.451
<v Speaker 1>who had be molested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The insight was while I was a little </v>

1090
01:02:56.451 --> 01:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so was my brother Bang.</v>

1091
01:02:56.791 --> 01:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1092
01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:00.540
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things that didn't make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense anymore.</v>

1093
01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:05.541
<v Speaker 1>Just fall into place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get this articulated representation </v>

1094
01:03:05.541 --> 01:03:08.340
<v Speaker 1>that can sum up a whole bunch of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>would you call them?</v>

1095
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Divergent and apparently unrelated image</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations and then all of a sudden</v>

1096
01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:17.430
<v Speaker 1>your path forward is clearer because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know more about who you are and you knew</v>

1097
01:03:17.431 --> 01:03:20.340
<v Speaker 1>more about how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going.</v>

1098
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:24.150
<v Speaker 1>So in that is in large part what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in psychoanalysis.</v>

1099
01:03:24.151 --> 01:03:26.280
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly what happens with dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

1100
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>which is something that Freud also </v>
<v Speaker 1>pioneered,</v>

1101
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:34.010
<v Speaker 1>know Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that dreams were wish </v>

1102
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:36.051
<v Speaker 1>fulfillments and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he believed that the function of </v>

1103
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.930
<v Speaker 1>dreams about wish fulfillments were to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect sleep.</v>

1104
01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:44.930
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're really thirsty and you go </v>

1105
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:47.460
<v Speaker 1>to sleep and you dream about drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

1106
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Some of you who have consumed too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>beer the night before it might be </v>

1107
01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:56.370
<v Speaker 1>familiar with those sorts of dreams and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're dreaming that you're searching</v>

1108
01:03:56.371 --> 01:04:01.371
<v Speaker 1>out fountains and you're drinking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud's interpretation that would be </v>

1109
01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:05.460
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should stay asleep.</v>

1110
01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:11.270
<v Speaker 1>And so the dream is providing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying interrelated motivational </v>

1111
01:04:12.841 --> 01:04:15.420
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say the one that governs thirst with the</v>

1112
01:04:15.421 --> 01:04:18.960
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment of desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's.</v>

1113
01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:24.050
<v Speaker 1>I really think that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's weird because dreams of </v>

1114
01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:24.120
<v Speaker 1>course could be doing all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1115
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.790
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what seems to happen instead,</v>

1116
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:32.510
<v Speaker 1>I realized this most particularly once I</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard about a study about the effects of</v>

1117
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.350
<v Speaker 1>testosterone cycling testosterone on </v>
<v Speaker 1>female sexual activity.</v>

1118
01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:40.080
<v Speaker 1>So the plan is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that in women,</v>

1119
01:04:40.081 --> 01:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>testosterone levels vary across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monthly cycle and sodas,</v>

1120
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>sexual desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what seems to happen is that as </v>

1121
01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:51.780
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone increases,</v>

1122
01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:56.100
<v Speaker 1>the frequency of sexual acts doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily increase,</v>

1123
01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.280
<v Speaker 1>but the frequency of sexual fantasy </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases and so the hormone is driving </v>

1124
01:05:01.891 --> 01:05:05.070
<v Speaker 1>the fantasies and then the fantasies </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive the behavior.</v>

1125
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:10.100
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the dream isn't fulfilling a </v>

1126
01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.331
<v Speaker 1>wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it's doing is that's how the </v>

1127
01:05:14.331 --> 01:05:16.710
<v Speaker 1>motivational system manifests itself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a plan for action.</v>

1128
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1129
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>you should be going to look for sources </v>
<v Speaker 1>of water if you're thirsty.</v>

1130
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.770
<v Speaker 1>And so because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1131
01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>your hypothalamus has to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you somehow.</v>

1132
01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just grip your behavior and </v>
<v Speaker 1>move you around like a robot,</v>

1133
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to indicate what the state,</v>

1134
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:39.420
<v Speaker 1>what state is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does that all sorts of ways and then </v>

1135
01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.660
<v Speaker 1>start tilting you towards the solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>using your memories and your skills and </v>

1136
01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>everything that would be related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful outcomes of that form,</v>

1137
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:51.090
<v Speaker 1>that form in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I should say about </v>

1138
01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:54.991
<v Speaker 1>creativity and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is I think something very </v>

1139
01:05:54.991 --> 01:05:55.960
<v Speaker 1>useful for understanding people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions to psychoanalysis.</v>

1140
01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of creative people in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clientele for for a variety of reasons </v>

1141
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.880
<v Speaker 1>and some who aren't creative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity is a trade and most people </v>

1142
01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 1>aren't creative.</v>

1143
01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:09.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1144
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.260
<v Speaker 1>and some people who are creative are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>

1145
01:06:11.261 --> 01:06:13.870
<v Speaker 1>It's just absolutely beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehension.</v>

1146
01:06:13.871 --> 01:06:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So the castle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1147
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:22.410
<v Speaker 1>created 65,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>works of art three a day for 65 years.</v>

1148
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Now that guy was created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1149
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:31.750
<v Speaker 1>lots of people aren't creative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not interested in psychoanalytic</v>

1150
01:06:31.751 --> 01:06:36.751
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not interested in </v>

1151
01:06:36.751 --> 01:06:36.751
<v Speaker 1>architectural ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not really gripped by narrative.</v>

1152
01:06:36.751 --> 01:06:38.500
<v Speaker 1>So if you happen to be one marker for </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>

1153
01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:42.670
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for openness is really liking fiction.</v>

1154
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.720
<v Speaker 1>So and women actually like fiction more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than men and because women are actually </v>

1155
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.650
<v Speaker 1>slightly higher and part of openness </v>
<v Speaker 1>that men are.</v>

1156
01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.460
<v Speaker 1>So what else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you like poetry,</v>

1157
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gives you an aesthetics.</v>

1158
01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic experience,</v>

1159
01:06:58.091 --> 01:07:00.280
<v Speaker 1>if you really get deeply involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

1160
01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:03.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're able to produce things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are created,</v>

1161
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.690
<v Speaker 1>so if you have the kind of mind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>works in association.</v>

1162
01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.640
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I told you guys,</v>

1163
01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.320
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down as many words as you can in </v>

1164
01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:15.490
<v Speaker 1>the next three minutes that begin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the letter l,</v>

1165
01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 1>those of you who are more creative would</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with more words.</v>

1166
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:22.480
<v Speaker 1>So there's a verbal fluency component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say,</v>

1167
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1168
01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 1>how many uses can you think of for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>break?</v>

1169
01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:32.220
<v Speaker 1>And then I would score that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first would be how many uses you </v>

1170
01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.461
<v Speaker 1>came up with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the sheer number I'd throw </v>

1171
01:07:35.461 --> 01:07:35.461
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stupid ones that make no sense.</v>

1172
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:38.160
<v Speaker 1>And often you have to get a panel of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to,</v>

1173
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.540
<v Speaker 1>to make that judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1174
01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.290
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1175
01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.350
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1176
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a thing that you could use it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1177
01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:45.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no x,</v>

1178
01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a score for that.</v>

1179
01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:52.380
<v Speaker 1>So then you get another score for how </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncommon your response was because </v>

1180
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.690
<v Speaker 1>that's an originality dimension.</v>

1181
01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>And naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you calculate those two dimensions,</v>

1182
01:07:58.130 --> 01:08:03.040
<v Speaker 1>fluency and originality from a divergent</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking tasks,</v>

1183
01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:08.070
<v Speaker 1>which is the what I just told you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can predict how creative people are </v>

1184
01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:11.431
<v Speaker 1>quite well anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The really creative people seem to have </v>

1185
01:08:11.431 --> 01:08:14.290
<v Speaker 1>a deep wellspring of unconscious ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are always flowing forth.</v>

1186
01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:19.291
<v Speaker 1>And some of those people dream like mad </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have extremely sophisticated </v>

1187
01:08:19.291 --> 01:08:22.520
<v Speaker 1>and complex dreams and those dreams seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to guide their behavior.</v>

1188
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:28.030
<v Speaker 1>So and that's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's quite entertaining when you see </v>

1189
01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:31.721
<v Speaker 1>that in psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have an interest in such things </v>

1190
01:08:31.721 --> 01:08:31.721
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1191
01:08:31.721 --> 01:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if your dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation is true?</v>

1192
01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's answer that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1193
01:08:35.601 --> 01:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>how do you know how you interpreted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last book you read is true?</v>

1194
01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>And the answer that is you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you don't.</v>

1195
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>And even if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how you know it,</v>

1196
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:47.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1197
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Because lots of people can read a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they come away with slightly </v>

1198
01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.911
<v Speaker 1>different interpretations of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because did imagine that the </v>

1199
01:08:54.911 --> 01:08:58.541
<v Speaker 1>book is a multilevel pattern and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reader is a multilevel pattern.</v>

1200
01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:03.140
<v Speaker 1>And then if you put those two together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a multilevel pattern that's made</v>

1201
01:09:03.141 --> 01:09:08.141
<v Speaker 1>out of the reader end of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to be unique for every </v>

1202
01:09:08.141 --> 01:09:11.411
<v Speaker 1>single reader except that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonalities of structure and so that </v>

1203
01:09:11.411 --> 01:09:14.990
<v Speaker 1>we can communicate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you read a book and it strikes you,</v>

1204
01:09:14.991 --> 01:09:17.270
<v Speaker 1>certain things strike you in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>things seem right.</v>

1205
01:09:17.271 --> 01:09:20.720
<v Speaker 1>If you do a dream interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a collaboration between you and the</v>

1206
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:24.110
<v Speaker 1>client about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the interpretation.</v>

1207
01:09:24.111 --> 01:09:27.350
<v Speaker 1>So usually what I do is I have people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1208
01:09:27.351 --> 01:09:30.140
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell me their dream from </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to end.</v>

1209
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Now Freud would say already you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>introducing all sorts of bias because </v>

1210
01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:36.170
<v Speaker 1>they're not telling you the dream.</v>

1211
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:39.890
<v Speaker 1>They're telling you the dream as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpret and remember it.</v>

1212
01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1213
01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:41.960
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1214
01:09:41.961 --> 01:09:43.370
<v Speaker 1>but you do what you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1215
01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.520
<v Speaker 1>And I tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just write it down as fast as you can </v>

1216
01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.311
<v Speaker 1>and try not to think about too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't want post dream </v>

1217
01:09:51.311 --> 01:09:54.661
<v Speaker 1>editing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I'll listen to it and then then </v>

1218
01:09:54.661 --> 01:09:59.621
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell it to me again slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll listen to a sentence and </v>

1219
01:09:59.621 --> 01:10:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll let my association network work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and see if,</v>

1220
01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:06.640
<v Speaker 1>see what that reminds me of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll ask the person what it </v>

1221
01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.520
<v Speaker 1>reminds them of and then we'll talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about these.</v>

1222
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Those are the direct association.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the things Freud would call</v>

1223
01:10:11.061 --> 01:10:12.800
<v Speaker 1>free associations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

1224
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:16.220
<v Speaker 1>well around every utterance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sentence,</v>

1225
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a collection of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings,</v>

1226
01:10:18.761 --> 01:10:23.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those meetings might be direct </v>

1227
01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 1>meanings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really tightly associated with it </v>

1228
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 1>to sort of loose meanings.</v>

1229
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:30.910
<v Speaker 1>And so you can hit it back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the client and therapist until you </v>

1230
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:31.010
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1231
01:10:31.011 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be.</v>

1232
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:37.630
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be where that's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're also thinking about it in </v>

1233
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:40.451
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the person's current </v>
<v Speaker 1>life experiences and the rest of the </v>

1234
01:10:40.451 --> 01:10:41.870
<v Speaker 1>dream and maybe all the dreams they told</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about before.</v>

1235
01:10:41.871 --> 01:10:45.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's insanely complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's what people do when they listen</v>

1236
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:48.140
<v Speaker 1>to a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1237
01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:50.450
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know your interpretation of a</v>

1238
01:10:50.451 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 1>conversation is true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1239
01:10:55.330 --> 01:11:00.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of ways that you can </v>

1240
01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:02.081
<v Speaker 1>approximate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yet you don't know and there's lots </v>

1241
01:11:02.081 --> 01:11:02.081
<v Speaker 1>of different ways of interpreting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

1242
01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 1>That's why the postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1243
01:11:04.251 --> 01:11:06.920
<v Speaker 1>ended up in their little hole with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to literature.</v>

1244
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:08.690
<v Speaker 1>They realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1245
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:11.450
<v Speaker 1>there's no limit to the number of ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can interpret a book.</v>

1246
01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they took the next step which </v>

1247
01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:17.020
<v Speaker 1>was the therefore it has no meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1248
01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:17.020
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1249
01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

1250
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:22.320
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very unsophisticated thinking.</v>

1251
01:11:22.321 --> 01:11:27.321
<v Speaker 1>It just means that the way the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>portrays meaning is exceedingly complex </v>

1252
01:11:27.321 --> 01:11:31.760
<v Speaker 1>and you can't describe it using normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>linear rationality doesn't mean the </v>

1253
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:36.741
<v Speaker 1>meaning isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so pathetic that it's dangerous </v>

1254
01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:41.901
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it means that nothing has any </v>

1255
01:11:41.901 --> 01:11:41.901
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1256
01:11:41.901 --> 01:11:42.840
<v Speaker 1>that's the most dangerous theory that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1257
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:48.680
<v Speaker 1>you talked to the person about the dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the dream image and what that </v>

1258
01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.230
<v Speaker 1>triggers off in their memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you also watch what they say because</v>

1259
01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:54.930
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1260
01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.820
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just happened recently,</v>

1261
01:11:56.821 --> 01:12:01.821
<v Speaker 1>someone might be describing a dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they know where they're wandering </v>

1262
01:12:01.821 --> 01:12:03.780
<v Speaker 1>around somewhere and they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm taking the wrong road.</v>

1263
01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:04.740
<v Speaker 1>You Think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1264
01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:09.741
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now we know what your dream meant </v>

1265
01:12:09.741 --> 01:12:09.741
<v Speaker 1>because he just said it.</v>

1266
01:12:09.741 --> 01:12:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking the wrong road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a Freudian slip and it's so </v>

1267
01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.820
<v Speaker 1>interesting because if you listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people tell their dreams,</v>

1268
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:18.450
<v Speaker 1>you have to kind of listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have two minds talking at</v>

1269
01:12:18.451 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the same time and one is describing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>

1270
01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:26.780
<v Speaker 1>but the other one is describing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and they don't even notice the </v>

1271
01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:26.780
<v Speaker 1>connection and you pointed out and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1272
01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1273
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.980
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know I said that,</v>

1274
01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:34.220
<v Speaker 1>and that's a Freudian slip and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in part is the right </v>

1275
01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:38.661
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an image accumulation and </v>

1276
01:12:38.661 --> 01:12:41.601
<v Speaker 1>aggregation system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a low resolution pattern </v>

1277
01:12:41.601 --> 01:12:45.381
<v Speaker 1>collection system users mostly images </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it tries to put them together in </v>

1278
01:12:45.381 --> 01:12:49.701
<v Speaker 1>meaningful ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the meaning is vague and </v>

1279
01:12:49.701 --> 01:12:51.240
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive and then the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere roughly speaking,</v>

1280
01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:56.241
<v Speaker 1>which is the linguistic hemisphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trying to state what that says in </v>

1281
01:12:56.241 --> 01:12:57.900
<v Speaker 1>words and it's very difficult to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1282
01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.550
<v Speaker 1>to make that transformation.</v>

1283
01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:04.550
<v Speaker 1>But that's why dream analysis works and </v>
<v Speaker 1>part is because you're facilitating the </v>

1284
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:08.541
<v Speaker 1>movement of the information in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>images into the articulated part of the </v>

1285
01:13:08.541 --> 01:13:10.650
<v Speaker 1>personality here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving information up,</v>

1286
01:13:10.651 --> 01:13:15.651
<v Speaker 1>the abstraction hierarchy to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it can be well utilized and that's</v>

1287
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:21.590
<v Speaker 1>now I'll end this with all end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this discussion of Freud with a </v>

1288
01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:26.760
<v Speaker 1>description of some research that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>done recently by relatively recently,</v>

1289
01:13:26.761 --> 01:13:31.761
<v Speaker 1>let's say the last 20 years by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist at the University of Texas </v>

1290
01:13:32.611 --> 01:13:37.611
<v Speaker 1>at Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's name is James Pennebaker and </v>

1291
01:13:37.611 --> 01:13:38.410
<v Speaker 1>pennebaker's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly smart psychologist.</v>

1292
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:43.850
<v Speaker 1>He had this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud had another idea that was related </v>

1293
01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:47.301
<v Speaker 1>to therapy and he thought that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened if you came into therapy and </v>

1294
01:13:47.301 --> 01:13:49.890
<v Speaker 1>you talked about a traumatic event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that you were cured by Catharsis,</v>

1295
01:13:49.891 --> 01:13:54.891
<v Speaker 1>which meant that that trauma had to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of emotion associated with it </v>

1296
01:13:54.891 --> 01:13:59.211
<v Speaker 1>and that was repressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was down there and kind of </v>

1297
01:13:59.211 --> 01:13:59.700
<v Speaker 1>struggling to get up and causing you all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of stress and misery.</v>

1298
01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Trying to hold it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you could just tell someone </v>

1299
01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.870
<v Speaker 1>about it and like express your feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that would help you.</v>

1300
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Expressing your feelings does not help </v>
<v Speaker 1>you by the way,</v>

1301
01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because that,</v>

1302
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.400
<v Speaker 1>that turns out to be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's wrong in an interesting </v>

1303
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:17.710
<v Speaker 1>and useful way because it sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost right.</v>

1304
01:14:17.711 --> 01:14:22.050
<v Speaker 1>So what pennebaker did was he took </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates and he had them come into</v>

1305
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:27.060
<v Speaker 1>the lab and for three sequential days </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had them write for 15 minutes </v>

1306
01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:33.450
<v Speaker 1>each day about the worst thing that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had ever done or the worst thing that </v>

1307
01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:36.511
<v Speaker 1>had ever happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often people are traumatized by </v>

1308
01:14:36.511 --> 01:14:37.180
<v Speaker 1>something they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not something that happened to them.</v>

1309
01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:40.000
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more often is someone watches themselves</v>

1310
01:14:40.001 --> 01:14:42.610
<v Speaker 1>do something absolutely horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they think,</v>

1311
01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:44.650
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

1312
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Who am I?</v>

1313
01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:47.830
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's,</v>

1314
01:14:47.831 --> 01:14:49.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things started coming unglued.</v>

1315
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.650
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pennebaker had them do that and then for</v>

1316
01:14:53.651 --> 01:14:55.720
<v Speaker 1>the next two weeks they felt pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>wretched about it.</v>

1317
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And so that's interesting because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have only measured the result</v>

1318
01:14:59.111 --> 01:15:02.080
<v Speaker 1>of the intervention in a two week </v>
<v Speaker 1>timespan,</v>

1319
01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:07.230
<v Speaker 1>everyone would've said never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never write down your traumatic </v>

1320
01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:07.230
<v Speaker 1>experiences because it'll make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

1321
01:15:07.230 --> 01:15:12.150
<v Speaker 1>But over the next six months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened in particular was that </v>

1322
01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:14.500
<v Speaker 1>their physical health improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went to the doctor last year,</v>

1323
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:19.510
<v Speaker 1>reported less illness and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's because their overall level of </v>

1324
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:21.280
<v Speaker 1>stress decreased for complex reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can talk about later.</v>

1325
01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:24.400
<v Speaker 1>But then pennebaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan and they excellent scientists,</v>

1326
01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:25.390
<v Speaker 1>he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1327
01:15:25.391 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 1>well Catharsis works here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're expressing your trauma and Poof,</v>

1328
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you're fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he went back and he thought,</v>

1329
01:15:31.781 --> 01:15:35.070
<v Speaker 1>well wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe how you express it matters.</v>

1330
01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:40.070
<v Speaker 1>So we went back and he counted all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words that were associated with emotion </v>

1331
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:43.860
<v Speaker 1>and all the words that were associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with understanding and cognition and </v>

1332
01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:47.440
<v Speaker 1>what he found was two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was the more words that you use,</v>

1333
01:15:47.441 --> 01:15:52.441
<v Speaker 1>particularly as your narrative developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that indicated comprehension and </v>

1334
01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:55.240
<v Speaker 1>understanding the better you did over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1335
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:59.560
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the expressing of your emotion,</v>

1336
01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:05.010
<v Speaker 1>it's the expressing of your emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the weaving of the memory into a </v>

1337
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:11.070
<v Speaker 1>new coherent representation from which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you derive a moral.</v>

1338
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:15.670
<v Speaker 1>So what's the moral of a trauma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't let it happen again.</v>

1339
01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:21.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the moral and the threat systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be throwing that thing up </v>

1340
01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:22.570
<v Speaker 1>at you constantly until you figure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1341
01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.020
<v Speaker 1>How did I get into this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I avoid it in the future?</v>

1342
01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.780
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it's your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your anxiety systems,</v>

1343
01:16:28.781 --> 01:16:29.740
<v Speaker 1>they don't care about that.</v>

1344
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:34.330
<v Speaker 1>They care about how you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into the same hole and the only way</v>

1345
01:16:34.331 --> 01:16:37.870
<v Speaker 1>to do that is to analyze the causal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways that lead to the whole to begin</v>

1346
01:16:37.871 --> 01:16:42.871
<v Speaker 1>with and see if you can either </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconfigure your behavior and your </v>

1347
01:16:42.871 --> 01:16:43.750
<v Speaker 1>attitudes so that that doesn't happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1348
01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.780
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you just don't go those places </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1349
01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:52.230
<v Speaker 1>You know either way and you're the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma threat systems.</v>

1350
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:57.930
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you come up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive representation that you </v>

1351
01:16:57.930 --> 01:16:59.080
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll leave you alone,</v>

1352
01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:02.380
<v Speaker 1>and this can happen very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly with nightmares.</v>

1353
01:17:02.381 --> 01:17:07.381
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've cured people's nightmares in one </v>

1354
01:17:07.381 --> 01:17:07.381
<v Speaker 1>session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

1355
01:17:07.381 --> 01:17:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I asked them to bring their nightwear to</v>
<v Speaker 1>opt in to their imagination.</v>

1356
01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone's chasing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1357
01:17:13.521 --> 01:17:16.220
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about them chasing.</v>

1358
01:17:16.221 --> 01:17:18.470
<v Speaker 1>You got to visualize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really visualize it.</v>

1359
01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:20.060
<v Speaker 1>The more real you make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

1360
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being chased.</v>

1361
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:23.390
<v Speaker 1>How are you feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all anxious and afraid.</v>

1362
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn around and look at the thing that's</v>

1363
01:17:26.931 --> 01:17:29.210
<v Speaker 1>chasing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they do that.</v>

1364
01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe they tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what it is or whatever,</v>

1365
01:17:31.611 --> 01:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they don't even do that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1366
01:17:33.771 --> 01:17:35.390
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now before you go to bed at night,</v>

1367
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:40.930
<v Speaker 1>just when you're almost falling asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a hypnagogic state where </v>

1368
01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:41.450
<v Speaker 1>images are starting to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You run that,</v>

1369
01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:47.050
<v Speaker 1>they run that Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nightmare is gone and the reason </v>

1370
01:17:47.050 --> 01:17:49.610
<v Speaker 1>for it is that they've now reconfigured </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves as the thing,</v>

1371
01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:52.700
<v Speaker 1>not the thing that's being chased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's prey animal.</v>

1372
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:58.210
<v Speaker 1>They've configured themselves as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that can turn around and face the </v>

1373
01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:02.831
<v Speaker 1>thing that's chasing them and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same Motif as the dragon haunting the </v>

1374
01:18:03.441 --> 01:18:08.441
<v Speaker 1>union archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right face what you're afraid of it not </v>

1375
01:18:08.441 --> 01:18:09.410
<v Speaker 1>will cure you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really one of the fundamental</v>

1376
01:18:09.411 --> 01:18:14.411
<v Speaker 1>motifs of Freud and psychoanalysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you have an exam on </v>

1377
01:18:14.411 --> 01:18:19.301
<v Speaker 1>Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll post questions about sort of </v>

1378
01:18:19.301 --> 01:18:20.720
<v Speaker 1>representative questions on the exam </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I get home after this lecture,</v>

1379
01:18:20.721 --> 01:18:22.580
<v Speaker 1>probably this evening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the latter there.</v>

1380
01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.850
<v Speaker 1>The essays are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the test is here.</v>

1381
01:18:25.851 --> 01:18:28.820
<v Speaker 1>It's multiple choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have no problem finishing it.</v>

1382
01:18:28.821 --> 01:18:31.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not that loan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you've done the readings and come</v>

1383
01:18:31.371 --> 01:18:33.710
<v Speaker 1>to the lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably do fine.</v>

1384
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:36.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a tricky test.</v>
