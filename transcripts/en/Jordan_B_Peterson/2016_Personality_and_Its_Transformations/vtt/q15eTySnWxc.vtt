1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto more trait conscientiousness.</v>

2
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Conscientiousness is a good predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm life success.</v>

3
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a good predictor negatively up </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce.</v>

4
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 2>So more conscientious people are less </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to get divorced.</v>

5
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good predictor of grades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a decent predictor of income.</v>

6
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a good predictor of social status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social status,</v>

7
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be particularly good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicting outcomes for people who are </v>

8
00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:48.121
<v Speaker 2>engaged in managerial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>administrative and process management </v>

9
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:52.921
<v Speaker 2>occupations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all of those occupations are </v>

10
00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:56.830
<v Speaker 2>characterized by the necessity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliability,</v>

11
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.160
<v Speaker 2>integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

12
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Speaker 2>attention to detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not associated with creativity,</v>

13
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's openness.</v>

14
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 2>So they opened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are better artists and </v>

15
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs by all appearances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all together conscientiousness seems </v>

16
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:24.511
<v Speaker 2>to be relatively positive trait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then you might wonder why there's</v>

17
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 2>a distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

18
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Like why isn't everybody hyperconscious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

19
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 2>it appears at least in part that as with</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other personality dimensions,</v>

20
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 2>there's increasing price to be paid as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you deviate from the average.</v>

21
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 2>And so unconscientious people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to rely on others to support </v>

22
00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:52.981
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not particularly ambitious or </v>

23
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:52.981
<v Speaker 2>reliable,</v>

24
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.700
<v Speaker 2>but they're not particularly rigid </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

25
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 2>And so one possibility might be that low</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of conscientiousness are an asset</v>

26
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 2>at certain times when combined with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other traits.</v>

27
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:12.841
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data isn't all in on this yet,</v>

28
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me quite likely that </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness,</v>

29
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:21.340
<v Speaker 2>which is an aspect of conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>

30
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:26.341
<v Speaker 2>breaks down into orderliness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>industriousness and those actually seem </v>

31
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:30.601
<v Speaker 2>to be importantly different think </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness probably puts an additional </v>

32
00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:37.021
<v Speaker 2>constraint on creativity now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've studied entrepreneurs for a </v>

33
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:41.101
<v Speaker 2>long time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clear that higher levels of </v>

34
00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:47.881
<v Speaker 2>orderliness certainly aren't associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with entrepreneurial entrepreneurial </v>

35
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:51.511
<v Speaker 2>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have the sneaking suspicion that </v>

36
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.541
<v Speaker 2>that's because no orderly people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>very concerned with doing whatever needs</v>

37
00:02:55.151 --> 00:02:58.240
<v Speaker 2>to be done in the particular way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's supposed to be done.</v>

38
00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 2>And the with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're creative,</v>

39
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 2>so if you're engaged in a creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>enterprise,</v>

40
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 2>the thing flipped around on you a lot.</v>

41
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of transformations as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're moving towards the end.</v>

42
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 2>And that's not exactly something in </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderly person is going to appreciate.</v>

43
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I also suspect that orderly people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to.</v>

44
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 2>There are two likely to obey rules to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurial or creative.</v>

45
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously being rules has its </v>
<v Speaker 2>utility,</v>

46
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't,</v>

47
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:31.141
<v Speaker 2>when the rules are wrong or when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to interfere with something that </v>

48
00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 2>might be conceptualized as higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a higher value than the rules themselves</v>

49
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.440
<v Speaker 2>for conscientious people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not self evident that there are </v>

50
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.101
<v Speaker 2>more important values then following the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules and doing things properly and so </v>

51
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of what makes them reliable </v>

52
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.880
<v Speaker 2>workers in decent citizens and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing.</v>

53
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 2>It's also partly what tips them towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism on the political spectrum.</v>

54
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:59.821
<v Speaker 2>So the best predictors of political </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism are low openness and high </v>

55
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly orderliness.</v>

56
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 2>So actually liberals and conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't seem to be much different than one</v>

57
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:11.971
<v Speaker 2>another in terms of industriousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're quite markedly different in </v>

58
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 2>terms of orderliness or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

59
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:18.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what predicts liberalism is high </v>

60
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.461
<v Speaker 2>openness and low in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly orderliness because you </v>

61
00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 2>don't necessarily have to just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicting con conservatism.</v>

62
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

63
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>now</v>

64
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 2>you remember the big two model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So conscientiousness lumps in with </v>

65
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.040
<v Speaker 2>emotional stability and agreeableness to</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce stability.</v>

66
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.430
<v Speaker 2>And as people age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become more stable,</v>

67
00:04:43.431 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Speaker 2>they become more conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more emotionally stable,</v>

68
00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 2>and more agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

69
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:52.381
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably interpret that somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasantly as an improvement in </v>

70
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:52.381
<v Speaker 2>maturity.</v>

71
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.100
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

72
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.280
<v Speaker 2>and conscientiousness is quite highly </v>
<v Speaker 2>correlated with neuroticism negatively.</v>

73
00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:02.700
<v Speaker 2>So it turns out generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the more conscientious you are,</v>

74
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 2>the less neurotic you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we think that that might be actually</v>

75
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:12.681
<v Speaker 2>because of the tendency of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness as a trade manifested </v>

76
00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:15.960
<v Speaker 2>across time to stabilize environments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

77
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:20.961
<v Speaker 2>so if you're a conscientious person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that because you're </v>

78
00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:24.380
<v Speaker 2>conscientious but not perfectionistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you stay on top of your </v>

79
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.210
<v Speaker 2>homework and you get your assignments </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

80
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.180
<v Speaker 2>let's even say ahead of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

81
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:35.181
<v Speaker 2>partly what that means is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount that you have to worry about how </v>

82
00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:39.741
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be doing decreases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course if you're conscientious </v>

83
00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:44.190
<v Speaker 2>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your field of opportunities opens up </v>

84
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.680
<v Speaker 2>from an employment perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus your income increases and you've </v>

85
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.190
<v Speaker 2>stabilized the environment around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's less uncertainty in it </v>

86
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.460
<v Speaker 2>and more security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you know,</v>

87
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:58.461
<v Speaker 2>it could easily be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness has its effect on </v>

88
00:05:58.461 --> 00:05:58.530
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism by stabilizing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

89
00:05:58.531 --> 00:06:03.531
<v Speaker 2>Taking the uncertainty out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then making people not so much really </v>

90
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:08.511
<v Speaker 2>less like lowered neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just less likely to be anxious and </v>

91
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:10.260
<v Speaker 2>emotional pain in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

92
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.490
<v Speaker 2>So here's some distinctions between </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness and industriousness.</v>

93
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.240
<v Speaker 2>You guys can decide where you fit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>these.</v>

94
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.540
<v Speaker 2>So if you're orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't leave your belongings around </v>

95
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.050
<v Speaker 2>you like order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's unsurprising one.</v>

96
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.590
<v Speaker 2>You keep things tidy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you follow a schedule,</v>

97
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.880
<v Speaker 2>you're bothered by missy people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want everything to be just right.</v>

98
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 2>You're bothered by disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

99
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like routine,</v>

100
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 2>you see that rules are observed and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

101
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:49.601
<v Speaker 2>Every detail is taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the other thing you can kind of </v>

102
00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 2>understand like what is the door to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People aren't that much fun,</v>

103
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also think that's relevant because</v>

104
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have different kinds of social </v>

105
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

106
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.740
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you value people because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their ability to contribute perhaps </v>

107
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.331
<v Speaker 2>from an economic perspective because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hard workers and they're </v>

108
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you think about Comedians,</v>

109
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 2>comedians have a fairly high social </v>
<v Speaker 2>value as far as I'm concerned,</v>

110
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 2>but the probability that they're orderly</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a class,</v>

111
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:15.940
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty much zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

112
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.950
<v Speaker 2>People are high in high in extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly low in agreeableness,</v>

113
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.040
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're just not gonna make rude </v>

114
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 2>comments about people to get a laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what comedians do,</v>

115
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 2>at least 50 percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're disagreeable and they have</v>

116
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:37.061
<v Speaker 2>to be pretty low in conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like really a conscientious </v>

117
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this just not going to happen?</v>

118
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 2>The lifestyle doesn't lend itself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

119
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

120
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 2>it's erratic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your employment is going to be erratic.</v>

121
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 2>The probability that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>regularly employed is low.</v>

122
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:52.121
<v Speaker 2>You're up at night all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always partying because that's </v>

123
00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:53.080
<v Speaker 2>the value that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

124
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 2>and then you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

125
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 2>you might think the same about people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are artistic performers,</v>

126
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 2>like musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

127
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be a rock musician for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

128
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:07.361
<v Speaker 2>when you're a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course that makes you just a typical </v>

129
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:09.971
<v Speaker 2>teenager in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're going to pursue that into </v>

130
00:08:09.971 --> 00:08:13.421
<v Speaker 2>adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of many more stable </v>

131
00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:13.670
<v Speaker 2>occupations that you have to forego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

132
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:18.671
<v Speaker 2>when you have to be willing to adopt the</v>
<v Speaker 2>router erratic and unpredictable </v>

133
00:08:18.671 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle that would go along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

134
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:23.310
<v Speaker 2>say a traveling musician and that also </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to not make you feel bad.</v>

135
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't exactly know what makes people </v>

136
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 2>industrious or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or conscientious,</v>

137
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:35.050
<v Speaker 2>but avoiding feeling bad seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>some seems to have something to do with </v>

138
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:40.361
<v Speaker 2>it except that it's complicated a </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the hypothesis fundamentally </v>

139
00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:44.831
<v Speaker 2>behind the big five traits analysis is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all the negative emotions load </v>

140
00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 2>together on a single factor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

141
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 2>So that's fundamentally neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you might say,</v>

142
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's neuroticism,</v>

143
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:56.111
<v Speaker 2>that all the negative emotions are </v>
<v Speaker 2>loading on what's leftover for the </v>

144
00:08:56.111 --> 00:08:59.531
<v Speaker 2>conscientious to use to feel bad with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we think that conscientiousness </v>

145
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 2>isn't a well understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dementia,</v>

146
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 2>like it's understood from a measurement </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

147
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 2>we can measure it quite accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mostly only using questionnaires,</v>

148
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 2>either self report or other persons </v>
<v Speaker 2>report.</v>

149
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any direct measures of </v>
<v Speaker 2>industriousness.</v>

150
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.890
<v Speaker 2>And so and so that's kind of strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's such a potent phenomena </v>

151
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 2>that you think that you could come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with lab tasks that industrious people,</v>

152
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:32.001
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would do a better job that than non </v>

153
00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 2>industrious people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we haven't been able to identify one</v>

154
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:36.990
<v Speaker 2>and we probably screamed 50 years 50 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>75 different tasks,</v>

155
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 2>never got any effect at all with </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness.</v>

156
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Thought we've had more luck because what</v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness seems to be associated with,</v>

157
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.820
<v Speaker 2>although not overwhelmingly powerfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is disgust,</v>

158
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:54.891
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity and so discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be an emotional access that's </v>

159
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 2>distinct to some degree from </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroticism.</v>

160
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say,</v>

161
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disgusting things,</v>

162
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 2>if you're too close to a disgusting </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

163
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 2>you'd also get anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's probably true,</v>

164
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.960
<v Speaker 2>but the emotion of disgust isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as the emotion of anxiety or the </v>

165
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 2>emotion of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disgust,</v>

166
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 2>a revulsion emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a getaway for me.</v>

167
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:23.151
<v Speaker 2>Emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's an emotion that will </v>

168
00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:23.151
<v Speaker 2>elicit anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive anger,</v>

169
00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:27.291
<v Speaker 2>to push something disgusting away or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be contemptuous of it or to roll your </v>

170
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:28.500
<v Speaker 2>eyes at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

171
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.710
<v Speaker 2>here's an interesting little fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the best predictors of impending </v>

172
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:40.221
<v Speaker 2>divorce is eye rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you have a couple in therapy and </v>

173
00:10:40.221 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 2>you noticed that when one talks the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other rolls their eyes,</v>

174
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.420
<v Speaker 2>you know that that's just not very good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's something to remember in your </v>

175
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:47.420
<v Speaker 2>own relationships.</v>

176
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.050
<v Speaker 2>If you're starting to roll your eyes at </v>
<v Speaker 2>your partner,</v>

177
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:50.100
<v Speaker 2>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

178
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 2>that's a contemporary response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a disgust response.</v>

179
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 2>If you're starting to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's either time to stop or time to</v>

180
00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:02.031
<v Speaker 2>start looking for a new partner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the orderliness discussed </v>

181
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:07.590
<v Speaker 2>connection turns out to be theoretically</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely interesting and we're going to</v>

182
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:09.900
<v Speaker 2>talk about that in some detail as we </v>
<v Speaker 2>move forward,</v>

183
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.930
<v Speaker 2>but I'll go through industriousness next</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so an industrious person carries out</v>

184
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 2>their plans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

185
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 2>that might be the critical element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>industriousness.</v>

186
00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:23.430
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the general </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuropsychological literature,</v>

187
00:11:23.431 --> 00:11:28.431
<v Speaker 2>what you generally derived from that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the prefrontal cortex is involved </v>

188
00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:33.441
<v Speaker 2>in behavior regulation because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal cortex is the part of the </v>

189
00:11:33.441 --> 00:11:37.371
<v Speaker 2>brain that people use to generate plans </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical </v>

190
00:11:39.661 --> 00:11:44.070
<v Speaker 2>function is primarily cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in so far as we've been able to</v>

191
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:49.071
<v Speaker 2>measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cognitive abilities of the </v>

192
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:51.681
<v Speaker 2>dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex appear </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be quite tightly linked to fluid </v>

193
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 2>intelligence as we discussed before.</v>

194
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And so it also stands to reason to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree that your ability to plan and </v>

195
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.290
<v Speaker 2>your intelligence might be associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your ability to carry out.</v>

196
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Your plans are not to waste time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the cortex overall has been viewed </v>

197
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 2>as an organ that inhibits impulsivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as we've discussed,</v>

198
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.490
<v Speaker 2>the idea that impulsivity is inhibited </v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably not the world's most </v>

199
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:22.141
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably more that impulsivity is </v>

200
00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:26.041
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary if you've developed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently sophisticated personality </v>

201
00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:30.721
<v Speaker 2>because you can get what you need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have through more complex and </v>

202
00:12:30.721 --> 00:12:31.570
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated means with less social </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

203
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this idea that's been maintained</v>

204
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:39.871
<v Speaker 2>in the neuropsychological literature for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very long time that the ability to </v>

205
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 2>plan is associated with increased </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over impulsivity.</v>

206
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 2>But the problem with that theory is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to be true.</v>

207
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Speaker 2>So there is no correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The correlation between intelligence and</v>

208
00:12:52.781 --> 00:12:54.400
<v Speaker 2>industriousness is zero.</v>

209
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's weird because man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take intelligence and correlate </v>

210
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.431
<v Speaker 2>it with something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's correlated with almost everything </v>

211
00:13:03.431 --> 00:13:03.431
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even disgust sensitivity if,</v>

212
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.940
<v Speaker 2>if we measure disgust sensitivity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety of ways of doing that,</v>

213
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 2>what we find is more intelligent people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are less disgust sensitive.</v>

214
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 2>So even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

215
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 2>the connection there is by no means </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious,</v>

216
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:20.191
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you could just as easily think </v>

217
00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 2>that intelligent people would be less or</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it be more discussed sensitive,</v>

218
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.310
<v Speaker 2>but that hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That isn't how it is now.</v>

219
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:29.311
<v Speaker 2>The idea of carrying out your plans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting one because </v>

220
00:13:29.311 --> 00:13:31.060
<v Speaker 2>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about what cognition is like,</v>

221
00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 2>especially abstract competition of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind that we were talking about last,</v>

222
00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.120
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last class.</v>

223
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:42.370
<v Speaker 2>In order to abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to separate the objects of your</v>

224
00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:45.820
<v Speaker 2>internal manipulation from the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

225
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.920
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an example.</v>

226
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.920
<v Speaker 2>So when you go to sleep at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little switch,</v>

227
00:13:50.921 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better term that shuts </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body down.</v>

228
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.120
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens is that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dreaming,</v>

229
00:13:58.121 --> 00:14:03.121
<v Speaker 2>of course you're dreaming about running </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and you move your eyes while </v>

230
00:14:03.121 --> 00:14:07.231
<v Speaker 2>you're dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it turns out the motor systems that </v>

231
00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:07.360
<v Speaker 2>control your eyes are shut down because </v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

232
00:14:07.361 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 2>You can move your eyes and still be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>bed asleep,</v>

233
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:14.670
<v Speaker 2>not running around in your dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you take a cat or another animal </v>

234
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.961
<v Speaker 2>and you destroy that off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>switch the capital run around and act </v>

235
00:14:19.301 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 2>out its dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

236
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:23.950
<v Speaker 2>So it's thinking is linked to its </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>

237
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:26.140
<v Speaker 2>So integrity that when it runs a </v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation,</v>

238
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 2>it's going to act it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

239
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:32.761
<v Speaker 2>human beings don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens when we think or we often </v>

240
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:36.931
<v Speaker 2>don't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are times when we can avoid doing </v>

241
00:14:36.931 --> 00:14:36.931
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

242
00:14:36.931 --> 00:14:38.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think you sit there,</v>

243
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.360
<v Speaker 2>you generate up your world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstraction,</v>

244
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 2>you have your abstract representations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you manipulate them and so you might</v>

245
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:49.201
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is what I'm going to do </v>

246
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:49.201
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You run a simulation in your head,</v>

247
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:53.240
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't be able to do that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't pull the simulated you away</v>

248
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 2>from the actual view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

249
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.710
<v Speaker 2>You have to divorce the representation </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the thing it's representing in </v>

250
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.521
<v Speaker 2>order to manipulate it abstractly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that opens up the possibility that </v>

251
00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 2>you can think through things perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>well without ever enacting your plants.</v>

252
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.720
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually what you see in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic realm.</v>

253
00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:16.721
<v Speaker 2>If you have a client who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscientious you've got a real </v>

254
00:15:16.721 --> 00:15:21.551
<v Speaker 2>problem because the person won't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that they say they're going to </v>

255
00:15:21.551 --> 00:15:21.551
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

256
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking,</v>

257
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:29.380
<v Speaker 2>especially for behavioral therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that someone will come </v>

258
00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.591
<v Speaker 2>in with a problem and you discuss an </v>
<v Speaker 2>array of potential solutions and you </v>

259
00:15:32.591 --> 00:15:37.541
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intelligent person could do that </v>

260
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.940
<v Speaker 2>better than an unintelligent person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you decide which of those potential</v>

261
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:41.780
<v Speaker 2>solutions might be implemented.</v>

262
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.260
<v Speaker 2>And then you wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

263
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.420
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to put too much of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>burden on the person because you want to</v>

264
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:52.190
<v Speaker 2>make the probability that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually implement the change very high,</v>

265
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:57.191
<v Speaker 2>so you do it quite slowly because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't that good at implementing </v>

266
00:15:57.191 --> 00:16:00.580
<v Speaker 2>behavioral changes and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully the person comes back and </v>

267
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.021
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I've tried this and here's the </v>

268
00:16:05.021 --> 00:16:05.021
<v Speaker 2>outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you modify it accordingly.</v>

269
00:16:05.021 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 2>It's called essentially called </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborative empiricism,</v>

270
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.370
<v Speaker 2>but the problem with doing that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's unconscientious is they'll</v>

271
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.400
<v Speaker 2>come back and they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

272
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get around to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

273
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.080
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what are you supposed to do about </v>

274
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.731
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if the person doesn't get </v>

275
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:21.731
<v Speaker 2>around to doing things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll help.</v>

276
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.960
<v Speaker 2>How can you get them to get around to </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing anything that'll help?</v>

277
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:28.961
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those flaws that seems to </v>

278
00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:28.961
<v Speaker 2>interfere with the process itself.</v>

279
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.340
<v Speaker 2>Now I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

280
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.550
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could make the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic about it and they'd be </v>

281
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 2>driven by enthusiasm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is more of a positive emotion,</v>

282
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:42.581
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you could terrify them half to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death by the negative consequences of </v>

283
00:16:42.581 --> 00:16:44.300
<v Speaker 2>not doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also useful,</v>

284
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:49.301
<v Speaker 2>or maybe they're agreeable and so they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be willing to do it for someone else </v>

285
00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:50.450
<v Speaker 2>like there's other places or if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>open,</v>

286
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:52.070
<v Speaker 2>you can think of a creative way to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

287
00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:54.110
<v Speaker 2>There's other places you can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>leverage,</v>

288
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.370
<v Speaker 2>but without the conscientiousness </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a real problem.</v>

289
00:16:58.371 --> 00:16:59.930
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really difficult.</v>

290
00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so industrious and it seems to be </v>

291
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.601
<v Speaker 2>associated with the ability or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>willingness God only knows to take </v>

292
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:12.701
<v Speaker 2>flammes that are formulated and then to </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement them into behavior and to </v>

293
00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:15.260
<v Speaker 2>reinstate them voluntarily into behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

294
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:17.720
<v Speaker 2>everyone knows that's a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult thing to do.</v>

295
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to settle yourself down</v>

296
00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:22.310
<v Speaker 2>to do a task,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially one that you don't want to do</v>

297
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.530
<v Speaker 2>so you're not enthusiastic about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

298
00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 2>That can carry you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to settle down and do a task</v>

299
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:30.050
<v Speaker 2>that you're not enthusiastic about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That takes effort,</v>

300
00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say it takes willpower and I </v>

301
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.811
<v Speaker 2>actually think the conscientious person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially I think especially the </v>

302
00:17:37.811 --> 00:17:42.371
<v Speaker 2>orderly person is an addict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a person who admires willpower and </v>

303
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:46.490
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like due to fullness as a,</v>

304
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:51.491
<v Speaker 2>as a moral construct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a conscientious person will do </v>

305
00:17:51.491 --> 00:17:54.471
<v Speaker 2>something because they should do it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have a duty to do it and </v>

306
00:17:54.471 --> 00:17:57.771
<v Speaker 2>that's partly also why you see </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness as an element of </v>

307
00:17:57.771 --> 00:17:59.640
<v Speaker 2>conservatism because conservatives tend </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be more patriotic,</v>

308
00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:04.641
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are more willing to think of </v>

309
00:18:04.641 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 2>their moral obligation in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>service to the structured community.</v>

310
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Now we just did a factor analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative belief,</v>

311
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:17.181
<v Speaker 2>conservative versus liberal belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of my students is presenting </v>

312
00:18:17.181 --> 00:18:17.181
<v Speaker 2>that for her phd defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

313
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:22.210
<v Speaker 2>we took a long time to do it about four </v>
<v Speaker 2>years to really get the measures down </v>

314
00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:25.911
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear about social conservative and </v>

315
00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:27.450
<v Speaker 2>fiscal social conservatism and fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism,</v>

316
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:29.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the social conservatives,</v>

317
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.220
<v Speaker 2>conservatives are usually in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the states,</v>

318
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:34.600
<v Speaker 2>they're pro life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

319
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.780
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

320
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.500
<v Speaker 2>they're usually not fans of gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage.</v>

321
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.440
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

322
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:44.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not advocates,</v>

323
00:18:44.821 --> 00:18:49.821
<v Speaker 2>generally speaking of a welfare state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're against single parent families </v>

324
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.940
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's all social conservative dot.</v>

325
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like a moral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a moral dimension of belief.</v>

326
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Whereas fiscal conservativism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like don't run deficits,</v>

327
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want it to put it,</v>

328
00:19:02.311 --> 00:19:07.311
<v Speaker 2>simply don't spend the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't spend any more money than it </v>

329
00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:07.311
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>

330
00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:11.990
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an important principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also isn't an agent of economic </v>

331
00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really seen that way.</v>

332
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:15.510
<v Speaker 2>They're more like minimal government </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

333
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 2>but we got no evidence for a split </v>
<v Speaker 2>between fiscal and social conservatism.</v>

334
00:19:19.561 --> 00:19:24.561
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just a media invention </v>

335
00:19:24.561 --> 00:19:28.310
<v Speaker 2>because we did construct validation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort that I've been talking to you </v>

336
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 2>about what we got instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're three factors.</v>

337
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.240
<v Speaker 2>We got masculine independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we decided to call it </v>

338
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.321
<v Speaker 2>because it was much more common among </v>
<v Speaker 2>men and it Kinda looked like </v>

339
00:19:39.321 --> 00:19:40.600
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a brand of conservatives,</v>

340
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:45.630
<v Speaker 2>which is basically you go and do your </v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody thing and I'll do my thing and </v>

341
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.950
<v Speaker 2>we'll either leave each other alone or </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we don't,</v>

342
00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:49.560
<v Speaker 2>we'll compete and one of us can win and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll be just fine.</v>

343
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.890
<v Speaker 2>So it looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that's interesting </v>

344
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 2>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it really got me thinking was that,</v>

345
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that classic explanation for why </v>

346
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.571
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives are conservative is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're afraid of they're </v>

347
00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:06.240
<v Speaker 2>afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's just no evidence for that.</v>

348
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives are less neurotic than </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals by a substantial margin and you</v>

349
00:20:10.841 --> 00:20:15.841
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is evidence that they have a </v>

350
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:15.841
<v Speaker 2>negativity bias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I don't really want to explain,</v>

351
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:20.800
<v Speaker 2>but what that means sometimes is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll actually pay more attention to </v>

352
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.600
<v Speaker 2>negative information rather than less in</v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison to liberal.</v>

353
00:20:22.601 --> 00:20:27.210
<v Speaker 2>So what it means is not clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the masculine independence dimension</v>

354
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:32.211
<v Speaker 2>is a very interesting one because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>implies that there's a reason for </v>

355
00:20:32.211 --> 00:20:35.781
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy beyond structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't win unless you play a </v>

356
00:20:35.781 --> 00:20:37.480
<v Speaker 2>structured game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

357
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.560
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what the masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent types want is they want to </v>

358
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:42.930
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get the damn rules straight.</v>

359
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you get them straight,</v>

360
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 2>all follow them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that'll a hierarchy because,</v>

361
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:53.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you produce a value </v>

362
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.951
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you produce a hierarchy because people </v>

363
00:20:55.951 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 2>compete towards fulfilling the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

364
00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:01.050
<v Speaker 2>they compete towards the end game and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll immediately produce a hierarchy </v>

365
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:01.250
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

366
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:02.740
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

367
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:08.130
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why would men be particularly </v>

368
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.281
<v Speaker 2>motivated to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer seems to be because of </v>

369
00:21:11.281 --> 00:21:12.790
<v Speaker 2>hyperglycemia and Heiberger b is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tendency of women to make a cross her up</v>

370
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:17.791
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the males compete with one another </v>

371
00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:18.100
<v Speaker 2>and they want to because they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>

372
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:23.580
<v Speaker 2>Part of the consequence of winning is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they have much more success with </v>

373
00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.520
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a primary motivator.</v>

374
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.210
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's interesting because it,</v>

375
00:21:27.211 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it provides a rationale for supporting a</v>

376
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.700
<v Speaker 2>relatively structured hierarchy that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with,</v>

377
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.300
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

378
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.620
<v Speaker 2>having to deal with the negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences of not having a stable </v>

379
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.500
<v Speaker 2>worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more,</v>

380
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:46.501
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another thing to think about to </v>

381
00:21:46.501 --> 00:21:48.451
<v Speaker 2>hear with regards to hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you have an ideal,</v>

382
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:52.420
<v Speaker 2>you immediately have a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you,</v>

383
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.480
<v Speaker 2>because of course let's say that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of children in gymnasium </v>

384
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.680
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well let's do somersaults to the other </v>

385
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:01.720
<v Speaker 2>side of the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:22:01.721 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 2>there's an implication there and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>implication is that you can be better or</v>

387
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 2>worse at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the kids will immediately compete,</v>

388
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:11.800
<v Speaker 2>especially the boys immediately compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>to roll to the other side of the wall as</v>

389
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:13.330
<v Speaker 2>fast as they possibly can.</v>

390
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.780
<v Speaker 2>And so if you want it to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

391
00:22:16.781 --> 00:22:21.781
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to get rid of values and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like a really stupid thing to do </v>

392
00:22:21.781 --> 00:22:21.781
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

393
00:22:21.781 --> 00:22:25.890
<v Speaker 2>because without values you have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive motivation because you feel </v>

394
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.090
<v Speaker 2>almost all your positive motivation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to a goal,</v>

395
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:33.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's not attainment of the goal </v>

396
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:33.420
<v Speaker 2>that makes people happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>

397
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.980
<v Speaker 2>it's observation of the fact that their </v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts are contributing to them moving </v>

398
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 2>towards a valued goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So okay,</v>

399
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:42.610
<v Speaker 2>so there's masculine independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one dimension.</v>

400
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Another dimension was basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious traditionalism and then there </v>

401
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 2>was more women who were aligned with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

402
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.660
<v Speaker 2>which was interesting because we found </v>
<v Speaker 2>more women on the far left of the </v>

403
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:54.660
<v Speaker 2>spectrum too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'll talk about in a minute.</v>

404
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the last one was something like</v>

405
00:22:57.221 --> 00:22:59.540
<v Speaker 2>ethnocentrism it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

406
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not like us,</v>

407
00:23:01.061 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 2>go away basically and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but none of those were fiscal,</v>

408
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:07.750
<v Speaker 2>social or none of them neither.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of those were fiscal or social.</v>

409
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:13.140
<v Speaker 2>So that was quite interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also shows you the utility of </v>

410
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.871
<v Speaker 2>getting your measurements right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't get your </v>

411
00:23:15.871 --> 00:23:18.421
<v Speaker 2>measurements right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know what you're talking </v>

412
00:23:18.421 --> 00:23:20.071
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And conservatism characterized along </v>

413
00:23:20.071 --> 00:23:23.191
<v Speaker 2>those three dimensions is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than conservative as in </v>

414
00:23:23.191 --> 00:23:25.180
<v Speaker 2>characterized as fiscal versus social.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not the same phenomenon.</v>

415
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.530
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

416
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so back to the industrious person </v>

417
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.260
<v Speaker 2>carries out his or her plans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wastes time,</v>

418
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.300
<v Speaker 2>negative con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Industrious.</v>

419
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:40.600
<v Speaker 2>People don't waste time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they stay,</v>

420
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.900
<v Speaker 2>they stay focused on their goal or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue acting in relationship to their</v>

421
00:23:47.421 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 2>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more accurate.</v>

422
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Finds it difficult to get down to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

423
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:56.350
<v Speaker 2>that isn't characteristic of industrious</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and you can see the willpower </v>

424
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.510
<v Speaker 2>element to that to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

425
00:23:56.511 --> 00:24:01.511
<v Speaker 2>you can tell yourself to sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and you will so messes things up.</v>

426
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:08.441
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what an industrious person </v>

427
00:24:08.441 --> 00:24:08.441
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finishes what he or she starts,</v>

428
00:24:08.441 --> 00:24:12.581
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts his or her mind on the task at </v>

429
00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:15.431
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there seems to be an intentional </v>

430
00:24:15.431 --> 00:24:17.351
<v Speaker 2>phenomena there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right is the person is able to focus in </v>

431
00:24:17.351 --> 00:24:20.060
<v Speaker 2>without distractions and gets things </v>
<v Speaker 2>done quickly.</v>

432
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:25.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>industrious people seem to be fans of </v>

433
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.611
<v Speaker 2>efficiency and you can kind of see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the efficiency in </v>

434
00:24:27.611 --> 00:24:27.611
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

435
00:24:27.611 --> 00:24:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Although you can also see at times where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the demand for more efficiency would </v>

436
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.610
<v Speaker 2>require the disruption of something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was previously orderly.</v>

437
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:37.650
<v Speaker 2>So an industrious person and an orderly </v>
<v Speaker 2>person might have a,</v>

438
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dispute about that always knows what </v>

439
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:42.900
<v Speaker 2>he or she is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's again,</v>

440
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of certainty and </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction that's associated with that </v>

441
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:47.500
<v Speaker 2>doesn't postpone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decisions,</v>

442
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:52.360
<v Speaker 2>isn't easily distract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An orderliness is the big predictor of </v>

443
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.650
<v Speaker 2>longterm life success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now orderliness is more predictive of </v>

444
00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.660
<v Speaker 2>success in jobs that require careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to the management of process </v>

445
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.621
<v Speaker 2>so that if something has become </v>
<v Speaker 2>something has been turned into an </v>

446
00:25:05.621 --> 00:25:06.260
<v Speaker 2>algorithm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that means there's a process by which</v>

447
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:11.261
<v Speaker 2>it might be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then in order to have a person is very </v>

448
00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:11.261
<v Speaker 2>good at making sure that the,</v>

449
00:25:11.261 --> 00:25:12.590
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

450
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.950
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

451
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.330
<v Speaker 2>that the algorithm runs exactly as it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to without error.</v>

452
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.140
<v Speaker 2>You see conscientious to this actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>has quite a good predictor of scientific</v>

453
00:25:22.141 --> 00:25:27.141
<v Speaker 2>productivity because one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that science does in large part is </v>

454
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.680
<v Speaker 2>reduce the reliance on intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase the reliance on </v>

455
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.560
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of its powers,</v>

456
00:25:34.561 --> 00:25:39.561
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you can be a not spectacularly </v>

457
00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:43.161
<v Speaker 2>bright scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're good at methodology and </v>

458
00:25:43.161 --> 00:25:44.190
<v Speaker 2>you're detail oriented and you know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature,</v>

459
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 2>you can figure out what the next problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to solve it's micro problem because </v>

460
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.000
<v Speaker 2>you know where the problems are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then science is like a,</v>

461
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.720
<v Speaker 2>almost like a meat grinder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

462
00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.500
<v Speaker 2>if you turn the crank properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feed in raw information,</v>

463
00:25:55.501 --> 00:26:00.501
<v Speaker 2>you turn the crank property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to make the next tiny step </v>

464
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:05.391
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's maybe the more open scientists </v>

465
00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:08.401
<v Speaker 2>to leap way the hell into the future and</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely transform a field at the </v>

466
00:26:08.401 --> 00:26:12.561
<v Speaker 2>level of fundamental presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the scientists are just </v>

467
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:15.090
<v Speaker 2>nibbling on the edges between order and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and you know,</v>

468
00:26:15.091 --> 00:26:16.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole monstrous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>

469
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.560
<v Speaker 2>the moving forward tiny amounts at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's partly what makes science </v>

470
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.980
<v Speaker 2>extremely powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

471
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.110
<v Speaker 2>We don't know why people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrious.</v>

472
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:33.010
<v Speaker 2>We can't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a sneaking suspicion I told you </v>

473
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:37.811
<v Speaker 2>that maybe part of it is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to win within a defined </v>

474
00:26:37.881 --> 00:26:41.680
<v Speaker 2>framework and then that might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with hyperglycemia.</v>

475
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Now one of the things you see is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a gender difference between men</v>

476
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:47.430
<v Speaker 2>and women in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>

477
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:53.030
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness overall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but women are more orderly than men and </v>

478
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:56.841
<v Speaker 2>men are more industrious than women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of goes along with the </v>

479
00:26:56.841 --> 00:26:58.530
<v Speaker 2>hyper gummy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you remember hypergo is this tendency</v>

480
00:26:58.531 --> 00:27:01.350
<v Speaker 2>that I described already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's the case had many,</v>

481
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:04.620
<v Speaker 2>many among many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many types of creature.</v>

482
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there might be that as a motivation,</v>

483
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:14.031
<v Speaker 2>although I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you can simply say </v>

484
00:27:14.031 --> 00:27:17.841
<v Speaker 2>that men think that if they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful they're going to have more </v>

485
00:27:17.841 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 2>luck with women.</v>

486
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Although that's certainly a conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>realization on the part of many men.</v>

487
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's such a deep phenomenon that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's built.</v>

488
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:29.460
<v Speaker 2>It's more like it's built into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational system a priority,</v>

489
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so anyways,</v>

490
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.840
<v Speaker 2>so that would go on the masculine </v>
<v Speaker 2>independence front.</v>

491
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.900
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we still haven't been able to </v>

492
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Speaker 2>manipulate that with any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to any great degree.</v>

493
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we're thinking as well that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people are doing is not so</v>

494
00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:53.511
<v Speaker 2>much striving to get to the top as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are trying really hard to stay away from</v>

495
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:56.940
<v Speaker 2>the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I would go along with the,</v>

496
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.800
<v Speaker 2>with the orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>industriousness overlap,</v>

497
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say if,</v>

498
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.780
<v Speaker 2>if I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of what makes you orderly and </v>

499
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.450
<v Speaker 2>somewhat industrious is disgust </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity.</v>

500
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.840
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that you might want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is flee from the bottom of dominance </v>

501
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.510
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies because the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy is a bad place to be</v>

502
00:28:18.511 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 2>from the perspective of maintenance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

503
00:28:21.481 --> 00:28:26.481
<v Speaker 2>like people at the bottom of dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies are generally speaking in </v>

504
00:28:26.481 --> 00:28:30.411
<v Speaker 2>much rougher shape than the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are closer to the top and so part of </v>

505
00:28:30.411 --> 00:28:34.550
<v Speaker 2>being industriousness might want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be maybe you're motivated by not </v>

506
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 2>wanting to fail and then you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

507
00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's anxiety,</v>

508
00:28:38.281 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Speaker 2>but maybe not.</v>

509
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people.</v>

510
00:28:41.371 --> 00:28:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you have someone walking down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the street and they encounter a homeless</v>

511
00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:46.240
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

512
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Is a conscientious person more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to give the conscientious person </v>

513
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.410
<v Speaker 2>money or give the homeless person to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give the homeless person money?</v>

514
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.410
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

515
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.560
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No agreeable person that they'll give </v>

516
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.051
<v Speaker 2>the person money to conscientious first </v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially the one that Sorta </v>

517
00:29:06.051 --> 00:29:09.060
<v Speaker 2>hyperarousal or say get a job and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that because conscientious people are</v>

518
00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:14.541
<v Speaker 2>also more judgmental and that goes along</v>
<v Speaker 2>with with the hierarchical attitude.</v>

519
00:29:16.411 --> 00:29:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

520
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:22.250
<v Speaker 2>they genuinely run on the principal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but being higher up in the hierarchy is </v>

521
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.560
<v Speaker 2>better and that there's something wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you from a moral perspective if you</v>

522
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:26.520
<v Speaker 2>happen to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

523
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.660
<v Speaker 2>among the failures and so one </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility is that part of the reason </v>

524
00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:35.991
<v Speaker 2>that conscientious people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>industrious people are that way is </v>

525
00:29:35.991 --> 00:29:38.751
<v Speaker 2>because they judge themselves quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>harshly and they really do not want to </v>

526
00:29:38.751 --> 00:29:39.660
<v Speaker 2>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because they're anxious,</v>

527
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:44.661
<v Speaker 2>it's because they're disgusted self </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusted by the possibility that they </v>

528
00:29:44.661 --> 00:29:49.441
<v Speaker 2>might count among the failures and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that grounded in an entirely different </v>

529
00:29:50.171 --> 00:29:51.280
<v Speaker 2>motivational system.</v>

530
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:57.180
<v Speaker 2>So now there's some other things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how about conscientiousness that are </v>

531
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:04.741
<v Speaker 2>pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're kind of revolutionarily </v>

532
00:30:04.741 --> 00:30:04.970
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

533
00:30:04.971 --> 00:30:07.180
<v Speaker 2>well the first thing I told you was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overall,</v>

534
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:09.850
<v Speaker 2>especially for industries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no theoretical model,</v>

535
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:14.851
<v Speaker 2>no neuropsychological bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no psychological model and no </v>

536
00:30:14.851 --> 00:30:16.840
<v Speaker 2>pharmacological model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could add to that no animal model.</v>

537
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.380
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty damn weird because </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>

538
00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:25.540
<v Speaker 2>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost always when you discover </v>

539
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:25.540
<v Speaker 2>something psychometrically and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stable,</v>

540
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.000
<v Speaker 2>you can start connecting it to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you've discovered.</v>

541
00:30:28.001 --> 00:30:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:33.421
<v Speaker 2>extroversion is associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentive reward and neuroticism is </v>

543
00:30:33.421 --> 00:30:34.940
<v Speaker 2>associated with the anxiety systems and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

544
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.080
<v Speaker 2>stability looks like it's associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with higher levels of Serotonin and </v>

545
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.591
<v Speaker 2>openness looks like it's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 2>decreased latent inhibition and like we </v>

546
00:30:43.591 --> 00:30:47.910
<v Speaker 2>know we've got some insight into what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on at other levels of analysis </v>

547
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:51.880
<v Speaker 2>with regards to these traits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conscientiousness.</v>

548
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:58.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except for this connection between </v>

549
00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:58.050
<v Speaker 2>orderliness and discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

550
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there conscientious animals?</v>

551
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:04.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough one.</v>

552
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:08.970
<v Speaker 2>You might say yes because sled dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>

553
00:31:08.971 --> 00:31:13.971
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like Australian blue heelers first </v>

554
00:31:13.971 --> 00:31:15.330
<v Speaker 2>of all they're super intelligence so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is something to take into account,</v>

555
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.940
<v Speaker 2>but they also really seem to like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

556
00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.510
<v Speaker 2>but I would say they're probably more </v>
<v Speaker 2>enthusiastic than conscientious,</v>

557
00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they love to work.</v>

558
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.840
<v Speaker 2>They're out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wagging their tail.</v>

559
00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:27.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's not what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing telephone sales,</v>

560
00:31:27.601 --> 00:31:28.820
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

561
00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:34.980
<v Speaker 2>I like this idea of value more ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

562
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't think animals has these kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>more route.</v>

563
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious like,</v>

564
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.990
<v Speaker 2>because if you look at chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

565
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chimpanzees and other primates,</v>

566
00:31:49.651 --> 00:31:54.651
<v Speaker 2>they have pretty stable dominance </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies there actually hereditary </v>

567
00:31:54.651 --> 00:31:58.070
<v Speaker 2>and the top primates are pretty rough on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom primates and a lot of it </v>

568
00:32:00.121 --> 00:32:01.110
<v Speaker 2>looks like contempt.</v>

569
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

570
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.790
<v Speaker 2>because what else would it be exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

571
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.210
<v Speaker 2>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to generate an animal</v>

572
00:32:09.211 --> 00:32:11.280
<v Speaker 2>model of disgust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another problem.</v>

573
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

574
00:32:12.351 --> 00:32:14.220
<v Speaker 2>you think about dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those bloody things,</v>

575
00:32:14.221 --> 00:32:16.170
<v Speaker 2>they're not disgusted by anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

576
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.160
<v Speaker 2>they're enthusiastic about lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that no nothing in its right mind</v>

577
00:32:20.161 --> 00:32:24.290
<v Speaker 2>should ever be enthusiastic about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

578
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.130
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

579
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:30.090
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright.</v>

580
00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.640
<v Speaker 2>So overall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're conscientious,</v>

581
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.800
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be more satisfied with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>

582
00:32:34.801 --> 00:32:37.890
<v Speaker 2>especially as you progress through time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to be more,</v>

583
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.920
<v Speaker 2>more happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be happier.</v>

584
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Which is funny because of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness is basically extroversion.</v>

585
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:47.360
<v Speaker 2>So you might ask what does that have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with conscientiousness?</v>

586
00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:52.361
<v Speaker 2>But what it seems to happen is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of your conscientious across </v>

587
00:32:52.361 --> 00:32:55.121
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life actually stabilizes and gets </v>

588
00:32:55.121 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so even though you might not be more</v>

589
00:32:56.091 --> 00:33:01.091
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be less miserable and they'll </v>

590
00:33:01.091 --> 00:33:02.921
<v Speaker 2>tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you give people a choice between les </v>

591
00:33:02.921 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 2>miserable and happier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll take less miserable because it's</v>

592
00:33:03.921 --> 00:33:08.921
<v Speaker 2>really painful to be miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's only so it's only moderately </v>

593
00:33:08.921 --> 00:33:09.770
<v Speaker 2>good to be happy.</v>

594
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:15.040
<v Speaker 2>We have a much bigger capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative emotion then for positive </v>

595
00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.101
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's positively related to life </v>

596
00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:22.811
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction and happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also positively related to </v>

597
00:33:22.811 --> 00:33:26.081
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conscientious people are more likely to </v>

598
00:33:26.081 --> 00:33:27.230
<v Speaker 2>get depressed now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there is part of the reason why there</v>

599
00:33:27.231 --> 00:33:29.330
<v Speaker 2>might be some variation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness.</v>

600
00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:31.820
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well conscientious people do really well</v>

601
00:33:31.821 --> 00:33:36.821
<v Speaker 2>when they're fully employed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you fire someone who's </v>

602
00:33:36.821 --> 00:33:40.211
<v Speaker 2>conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do not have a good time of it </v>

603
00:33:40.211 --> 00:33:43.390
<v Speaker 2>because the judgmental part of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality starts to wreak havoc with </v>

604
00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:44.190
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

605
00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.790
<v Speaker 2>because their attitude is if you work </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

606
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.410
<v Speaker 2>you can get ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

607
00:33:48.411 --> 00:33:53.411
<v Speaker 2>And so that's an index.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your success is an index of your moral </v>

608
00:33:53.411 --> 00:33:53.411
<v Speaker 2>value essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

609
00:33:53.411 --> 00:33:55.760
<v Speaker 2>so then you lose your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your employment.</v>

610
00:33:55.761 --> 00:33:57.560
<v Speaker 2>What the hell are you supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclude?</v>

611
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't conclude that the whole </v>

612
00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:05.411
<v Speaker 2>system is rotten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're very unlikely to do that if </v>

613
00:34:05.411 --> 00:34:05.760
<v Speaker 2>you're conscientious because you're sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a patriotic type and,</v>

614
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:06.480
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

615
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.560
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you identify quite strongly with the </v>

616
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.380
<v Speaker 2>structure of the system and plus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

617
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:16.070
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people are very concerned </v>
<v Speaker 2>with justice and they might think,</v>

618
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:21.071
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to have this attitude </v>

619
00:34:21.071 --> 00:34:21.071
<v Speaker 2>towards other people who failed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

620
00:34:21.071 --> 00:34:24.791
<v Speaker 2>who are unemployed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say I have to have the same </v>

621
00:34:24.791 --> 00:34:24.791
<v Speaker 2>attitude towards me.</v>

622
00:34:24.791 --> 00:34:25.160
<v Speaker 2>And so what you see with conscientious </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

623
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.110
<v Speaker 2>if they're having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

624
00:34:27.111 --> 00:34:32.111
<v Speaker 2>maybe they've got laid off at work </v>
<v Speaker 2>really through absolutely no fault of </v>

625
00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:36.071
<v Speaker 2>their own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are just torn up by it because one </v>

626
00:34:36.071 --> 00:34:38.710
<v Speaker 2>of the things they do that's different </v>
<v Speaker 2>for an unconscientious person,</v>

627
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.490
<v Speaker 2>everything is always someone else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fault.</v>

628
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.250
<v Speaker 2>But for a conscientious person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite.</v>

629
00:34:43.251 --> 00:34:45.050
<v Speaker 2>Everything is always their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

630
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:50.051
<v Speaker 2>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an advantage to that because if </v>

631
00:34:50.051 --> 00:34:50.360
<v Speaker 2>you take responsibility for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

632
00:34:50.361 --> 00:34:55.361
<v Speaker 2>then there's a possibility that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>make whatever changes you can to improve</v>

633
00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 2>your situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

634
00:34:56.691 --> 00:34:59.150
<v Speaker 2>So even if you're only 10 percent at </v>
<v Speaker 2>fault,</v>

635
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.200
<v Speaker 2>if you take responsibility for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can fix that 10 percent and </v>

636
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.260
<v Speaker 2>maybe things will work out better for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

637
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:11.650
<v Speaker 2>So you know there's some advantages to </v>
<v Speaker 2>overestimating the degree to which </v>

638
00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:11.780
<v Speaker 2>you're at fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you say,</v>

639
00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:12.890
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the system,</v>

640
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.270
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

641
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.050
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

642
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:15.890
<v Speaker 2>go fix that.</v>

643
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a very effective means of </v>

644
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.670
<v Speaker 2>coping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in psychotic depression,</v>

645
00:35:22.671 --> 00:35:24.230
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very,</v>

646
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:27.950
<v Speaker 2>very extreme form of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you often see is that the depressed</v>

647
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:32.951
<v Speaker 2>person erroneously concludes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a metaphysical conclusion </v>

648
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 2>almost that their faults are integrally </v>
<v Speaker 2>tied to the,</v>

649
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to everything that happens that's bad in</v>

650
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:44.100
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they take on all of the guilt for</v>

651
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 2>everything that's gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously that's,</v>

652
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a point at which that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively counterproductive conclusion,</v>

653
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:55.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially because often when bad </v>

654
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.731
<v Speaker 2>things happen to you in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a random element and you know,</v>

655
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.870
<v Speaker 2>you can't really treat yourself properly</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you take that random element into</v>

656
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can overestimate it,</v>

657
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:10.971
<v Speaker 2>which is what you do if you're under an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscientious and you could could </v>

658
00:36:10.971 --> 00:36:14.990
<v Speaker 2>overestimate it if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscientious and underestimated if </v>

659
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:16.650
<v Speaker 2>you're conscientious and there's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>be times when you paid for both of those</v>

660
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 2>attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

661
00:36:18.301 --> 00:36:20.640
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people don't do very well </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're,</v>

662
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.300
<v Speaker 2>when they're not doing very well because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

663
00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.650
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they judge themselves very harshly.</v>

664
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.450
<v Speaker 2>So that's partly what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's related to guilt.</v>

665
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:36.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny thing because there's an </v>

666
00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:37.170
<v Speaker 2>element of guilt that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness to.</v>

667
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.190
<v Speaker 2>So conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People feel guilt less often,</v>

668
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.200
<v Speaker 2>but they're more sensitive to it.</v>

669
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:45.880
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>

670
00:36:45.881 --> 00:36:48.560
<v Speaker 2>well that's kind of paradoxical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly paradoxical.</v>

671
00:36:48.561 --> 00:36:53.561
<v Speaker 2>If you're sensitive to guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might arrange things so that you </v>

672
00:36:53.561 --> 00:36:54.940
<v Speaker 2>have nothing to feel guilty about and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what conscientious people seem to</v>

673
00:36:54.941 --> 00:36:57.490
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so guilt,</v>

674
00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:04.020
<v Speaker 2>guilt and shame seem to be emotions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are integrally associated with </v>

675
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.730
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and they're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to disentangle it,</v>

676
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe they're not even really </v>

677
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:11.860
<v Speaker 2>separate things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but shame seems to be something that you</v>

678
00:37:11.861 --> 00:37:14.860
<v Speaker 2>feel when you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps in the eyes of others.</v>

679
00:37:14.861 --> 00:37:19.861
<v Speaker 2>And guilt is something that you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you fail according to your own </v>

680
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:23.791
<v Speaker 2>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know that that's kind of a messy </v>

681
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:26.011
<v Speaker 2>definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but conscientious people do seem to be </v>

682
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:28.840
<v Speaker 2>more prone to shame and guilt and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to be in principle,</v>

683
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 2>mediated by different systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the systems that mediate anxiety </v>

684
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:38.550
<v Speaker 2>and emotional pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know what the systems are </v>

685
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:42.600
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can also think about it in </v>

686
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:42.920
<v Speaker 2>relationship to something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

687
00:37:42.921 --> 00:37:46.160
<v Speaker 2>what to what the existentialists called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the existential burden.</v>

688
00:37:46.161 --> 00:37:51.161
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are always doing things in groups</v>

689
00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:52.780
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

690
00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:00.380
<v Speaker 2>the groups are often oriented to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to produce a certain outcome like a </v>

691
00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:04.761
<v Speaker 2>hunting party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could say that if we're thinking of </v>

692
00:38:04.761 --> 00:38:04.761
<v Speaker 2>it from an evolutionary perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a,</v>

693
00:38:04.761 --> 00:38:07.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big goal and it's an important</v>

694
00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:12.051
<v Speaker 2>goal and they're going to be good </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunters and hundreds of that aren't so </v>

695
00:38:12.051 --> 00:38:12.051
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

696
00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:18.650
<v Speaker 2>part of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is to think of a hierarchy as </v>

697
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.131
<v Speaker 2>something other than a dominant tire </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the dominance hierarchy theory </v>

698
00:38:22.131 --> 00:38:25.671
<v Speaker 2>is slightly flawed because it implies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the hierarchy is only based on </v>

699
00:38:25.671 --> 00:38:25.671
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

700
00:38:25.671 --> 00:38:30.021
<v Speaker 2>But that's not right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you have a hunting party or a </v>

701
00:38:30.021 --> 00:38:33.420
<v Speaker 2>building crew or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what elevates one man above the</v>

702
00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:35.440
<v Speaker 2>other in the dominance hierarchy isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

703
00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:37.150
<v Speaker 2>It's competence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

704
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:42.151
<v Speaker 2>so the best hunter has the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>reputation or the best builder has the </v>

705
00:38:42.151 --> 00:38:42.780
<v Speaker 2>highest reputation or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on,</v>

706
00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:47.810
<v Speaker 2>on what the hierarchy is devoted for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the person who's best at that rises </v>

707
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.810
<v Speaker 2>to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

708
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.650
<v Speaker 2>all other things being equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's often the case even if people</v>

709
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:52.540
<v Speaker 2>don't like them very much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

710
00:38:52.541 --> 00:38:57.541
<v Speaker 2>we've done investigations into corporate</v>
<v Speaker 2>structures where someone will be </v>

711
00:38:57.541 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 2>approved by a relatively large majority </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people who worked for the company</v>

712
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.230
<v Speaker 2>because they're hyper competent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no one really likes no one.</v>

713
00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.250
<v Speaker 2>So you can't really think of that as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

714
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:12.340
<v Speaker 2>either a popularity contest or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's based on power.</v>

715
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think that a decent hierarchies </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost never based on power,</v>

716
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 2>based on competence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now those two things get tangled up,</v>

717
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:24.990
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then you think one of the things </v>

718
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:28.861
<v Speaker 2>that's going to make people prone to </v>
<v Speaker 2>being successful is to feel some </v>

719
00:39:31.301 --> 00:39:36.301
<v Speaker 2>responsibility in relationship to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>capacity to attain a goal in a group </v>

720
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:42.900
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's partly the origin of </v>

721
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.510
<v Speaker 2>both conscientiousness and guilt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shame.</v>

722
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:48.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of times if you talk to unemployed </v>

723
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.870
<v Speaker 2>people and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.090
<v Speaker 2>we hear a lot about rates of depression </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that sort of thing,</v>

725
00:39:52.091 --> 00:39:54.610
<v Speaker 2>but what kind of boneheaded about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way we measure things.</v>

726
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to be depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best thing to do is lose your job.</v>

727
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.380
<v Speaker 2>And then you really got to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you depressed or are you unemployed?</v>

728
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those aren't the same thing.</v>

729
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.620
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

730
00:40:05.621 --> 00:40:08.590
<v Speaker 2>well for some people unemployment </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make them depressed.</v>

731
00:40:08.591 --> 00:40:09.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

732
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:14.101
<v Speaker 2>we know that that's the unconscientious </v>
<v Speaker 2>people or maybe the unconscientious </v>

733
00:40:14.101 --> 00:40:14.101
<v Speaker 2>people and the emotionally stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

734
00:40:14.101 --> 00:40:17.620
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for the people who are conscientious</v>

735
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:20.710
<v Speaker 2>and also maybe somewhat neurotic man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just going to wipe them out.</v>

736
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:23.920
<v Speaker 2>But to think about that as psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>is rather foolish,</v>

737
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

738
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:29.530
<v Speaker 2>it's an actual loss and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>responding to it in a natural way.</v>

739
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.740
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

740
00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually people who are unemployed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

741
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:40.231
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed is because they're worried </v>

742
00:40:40.231 --> 00:40:40.231
<v Speaker 2>about their future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

743
00:40:40.231 --> 00:40:44.430
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the only reason they </v>
<v Speaker 2>often talk about is that they've let </v>

744
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:48.510
<v Speaker 2>people down and so that would be people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their family or they let themselves </v>

745
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:52.171
<v Speaker 2>down or they're performing underneath </v>
<v Speaker 2>their capacity or they're just useless </v>

746
00:40:52.171 --> 00:40:52.210
<v Speaker 2>and are contributing.</v>

747
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 2>And those are all places where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their guilt will start to eat them up.</v>

748
00:40:56.591 --> 00:41:01.591
<v Speaker 2>And those are the sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem also to be associated with </v>

749
00:41:01.591 --> 00:41:02.110
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like the idea that you know,</v>

750
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:05.830
<v Speaker 2>you're part of a team of sled dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

751
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.740
<v Speaker 2>you have a responsibility to pull your </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>

752
00:41:08.741 --> 00:41:13.741
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not pulling your weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's something contemptible </v>

753
00:41:13.741 --> 00:41:16.411
<v Speaker 2>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you happen to be one of those </v>

754
00:41:16.411 --> 00:41:18.601
<v Speaker 2>people who aren't pulling their weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's something contemptible </v>

755
00:41:18.601 --> 00:41:18.601
<v Speaker 2>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's you making the judgment.</v>

756
00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.180
<v Speaker 2>So and conscientious people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely more judgmental.</v>

757
00:41:22.181 --> 00:41:25.630
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read them,</v>

758
00:41:25.631 --> 00:41:30.130
<v Speaker 2>if you tell them stories about people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who performed various criminal and cause</v>

759
00:41:30.131 --> 00:41:35.131
<v Speaker 2>I criminal acts and you get them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimate the sentence that they should </v>

760
00:41:35.131 --> 00:41:38.120
<v Speaker 2>be subjected to the conscientious people</v>
<v Speaker 2>will reliably,</v>

761
00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:43.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put people in prison for longer periods </v>

762
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:43.620
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>

763
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.510
<v Speaker 2>They don't like violations of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like violations of norms or </v>

764
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:48.380
<v Speaker 2>violations of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so and so,</v>

765
00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the reasons that people might,</v>

766
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.350
<v Speaker 2>that there might be a distribution and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness is like maybe when the</v>

767
00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 2>whole economy collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happens fairly frequently,</v>

768
00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.140
<v Speaker 2>the conscientious people just wipe </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves out.</v>

769
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:05.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so depressed and so self </v>

770
00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:06.700
<v Speaker 2>judgemental and so crushed that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't handle the,</v>

771
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

772
00:42:07.731 --> 00:42:08.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call that?</v>

773
00:42:08.871 --> 00:42:13.580
<v Speaker 2>That's the very high variability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the word I was looking for.</v>

774
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.690
<v Speaker 2>So they get clipped off when things fail</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm conscientious person doesn't</v>

775
00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:22.691
<v Speaker 2>really care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually sort of almost like </v>

776
00:42:22.691 --> 00:42:25.601
<v Speaker 2>the defining characteristic of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscientious person is they don't </v>

777
00:42:25.601 --> 00:42:26.390
<v Speaker 2>really care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's an interesting thing too,</v>

778
00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:31.391
<v Speaker 2>because it's often more fun to be around</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscientious people than it is to be </v>

779
00:42:31.391 --> 00:42:34.700
<v Speaker 2>around conscientious people because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard to relax around people who are</v>

780
00:42:34.701 --> 00:42:36.950
<v Speaker 2>really orderly and judgmental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

781
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:40.310
<v Speaker 2>he can't even sit improperly or you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>judged for it.</v>

782
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're in someone's house and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're unconscientious,</v>

783
00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:48.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you throw your beer can on the </v>

784
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:48.450
<v Speaker 2>floor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just laugh and throw their beer,</v>

785
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.030
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>

786
00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's difficult to relax with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with really hyper conscientious people.</v>

787
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.570
<v Speaker 2>It's probably difficult to have fun with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

788
00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I think it's difficult for them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>relax,</v>

789
00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:00.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

790
00:43:00.221 --> 00:43:03.530
<v Speaker 2>they tend like conservative people tend </v>
<v Speaker 2>to read less,</v>

791
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you might think,</v>

792
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:07.720
<v Speaker 2>well that might be associated with their</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in it,</v>

793
00:43:07.721 --> 00:43:10.430
<v Speaker 2>intellectual activity because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>also lower and openness.</v>

794
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.480
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's also because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard reading as a waste of time,</v>

795
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:18.230
<v Speaker 2>not because they exactly regard reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a waste of time,</v>

796
00:43:18.231 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 2>but they feel guilty if they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>working and instead they're sitting down</v>

797
00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 2>reading a bus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing sitting down reading </v>

798
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 2>a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

799
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.120
<v Speaker 2>there's work to be done and so they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>very work oriented,</v>

800
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.620
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>

801
00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.490
<v Speaker 2>orderliness is a good predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatism as we've already said,</v>

802
00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:43.690
<v Speaker 2>and it's associated with disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity and preference for order and</v>

803
00:43:43.691 --> 00:43:45.970
<v Speaker 2>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not egalitarianism.</v>

804
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.710
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

805
00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.730
<v Speaker 2>where's the sanitarium motivations?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they all seem to pile up pretty much</v>

806
00:43:51.731 --> 00:43:56.731
<v Speaker 2>on agreeableness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the conscientious people basically </v>

807
00:43:56.731 --> 00:43:59.260
<v Speaker 2>say you can get ahead if you play the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game properly and you abide by the rules</v>

808
00:43:59.261 --> 00:44:02.080
<v Speaker 2>and you work and the agreeable people </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

809
00:44:02.081 --> 00:44:07.081
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's lots of people who can't </v>

810
00:44:07.081 --> 00:44:08.911
<v Speaker 2>really manage that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not just going to push them off a </v>

811
00:44:08.911 --> 00:44:11.521
<v Speaker 2>cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to be taken care of and you </v>

812
00:44:11.521 --> 00:44:11.521
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation wasn't fair to begin with,</v>

813
00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

814
00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:18.090
<v Speaker 2>and there's a battle between that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and there's a battle because </v>

815
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.140
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness and conscientiousness are </v>
<v Speaker 2>orthogonal,</v>

816
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:23.860
<v Speaker 2>which means that they actually traverse </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ethics.</v>

817
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're not opposites on the </v>

818
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:28.920
<v Speaker 2>continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness and agreeableness.</v>

819
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.280
<v Speaker 2>That's not it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

820
00:44:30.281 --> 00:44:32.300
<v Speaker 2>and it looks like in order for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

821
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.700
<v Speaker 2>in order for people to adjust to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world of human beings,</v>

822
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.320
<v Speaker 2>you have to be agreeable to some measure</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be conscientious to some</v>

823
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 2>measure and the question is how much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>each and the answer is,</v>

824
00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:46.380
<v Speaker 2>well it depends on the circumstances and</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you place yourself,</v>

825
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:50.160
<v Speaker 2>but at the same question applies to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the polity at large,</v>

826
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:54.300
<v Speaker 2>how agreeable should it be versus how </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious shouldn't be.</v>

827
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>

828
00:44:55.770 --> 00:45:00.770
<v Speaker 2>It's not a problem with a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The solution is only to be derived from </v>

829
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:06.021
<v Speaker 2>a continual dialogue say between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientious people at the agreeable </v>

830
00:45:06.021 --> 00:45:09.120
<v Speaker 2>people because the answer varies as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment varies.</v>

831
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:13.440
<v Speaker 2>So you can come up with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an end solution to that problem.</v>

832
00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.610
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

833
00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.550
<v Speaker 2>you know the conscientious people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll say the conservatives for them,</v>

834
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:24.230
<v Speaker 2>for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they liked hierarchies.</v>

835
00:45:24.231 --> 00:45:29.231
<v Speaker 2>They like order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like a game that everyone can play </v>

836
00:45:29.231 --> 00:45:32.711
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people can win and they make the </v>

837
00:45:32.711 --> 00:45:34.650
<v Speaker 2>assumption that if you play properly in </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in that,</v>

838
00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:36.890
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you've done something good.</v>

839
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:43.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is is that if you're </v>

840
00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:45.110
<v Speaker 2>steeping up the hierarchy enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one gets to climate and then the </v>

841
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:49.601
<v Speaker 2>whole bloody society starts to crumble </v>
<v Speaker 2>and breakdown because the rates of </v>

842
00:45:49.601 --> 00:45:50.000
<v Speaker 2>violence go way up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see there's a.</v>

843
00:45:50.001 --> 00:45:53.960
<v Speaker 2>there's an upper bound to the steepness </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a hierarchy and so you might say,</v>

844
00:45:53.961 --> 00:45:56.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where conscientiousness hits it.</v>

845
00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Limit hits its limit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could even say that's where </v>

846
00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.700
<v Speaker 2>meritocratic meritocracy hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>hits its limit because you know,</v>

847
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:08.710
<v Speaker 2>if you're intelligent and conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're much more likely to rise to the </v>

848
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:09.530
<v Speaker 2>top of a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well fine.</v>

849
00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you want smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardworking people at the top of </v>

850
00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:14.830
<v Speaker 2>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>

851
00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.820
<v Speaker 2>if it's steep like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then</v>

852
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 2>there's a point at which that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable.</v>

853
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:25.200
<v Speaker 2>And so the hierarchy has to be flat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow you know no one,</v>

854
00:46:25.201 --> 00:46:27.570
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's also something that agreeable</v>

855
00:46:27.571 --> 00:46:32.571
<v Speaker 2>people would say right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what about the strata at the bottom </v>

856
00:46:32.571 --> 00:46:36.051
<v Speaker 2>or just above the bottom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to ensure that they </v>

857
00:46:36.051 --> 00:46:37.140
<v Speaker 2>don't fall right out of the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>altogether?</v>

858
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Which is a perfectly reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reasonable question.</v>

859
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:42.900
<v Speaker 2>And answer to that both those questions </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>

860
00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:47.901
<v Speaker 2>we don't know how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we're trying to solve that </v>

861
00:46:47.901 --> 00:46:50.130
<v Speaker 2>problem continually as we go along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So orderly.</v>

862
00:46:50.131 --> 00:46:52.590
<v Speaker 2>People also have harsh judgments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>moral transgressions.</v>

863
00:46:52.591 --> 00:46:57.591
<v Speaker 2>We talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's an idea of a behavioral </v>

864
00:46:57.591 --> 00:46:57.591
<v Speaker 2>immune system here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is a cool,</v>

865
00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.590
<v Speaker 2>cool</v>

866
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.900
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

867
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:13.910
<v Speaker 2>So disgust is considered to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the basic human emotions defined by a </v>

868
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:17.430
<v Speaker 2>strong revulsion and desire to withdraw </v>
<v Speaker 2>from and the listening stimulus or event</v>

869
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.480
<v Speaker 2>physically disgust as a company by </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinct facial expression involving </v>

870
00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.260
<v Speaker 2>constriction of the oral and nasal </v>
<v Speaker 2>cavities.</v>

871
00:47:24.261 --> 00:47:27.630
<v Speaker 2>So it's something like that to close </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself off.</v>

872
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Evolutionary models of people make that </v>
<v Speaker 2>face when they hear a dirty joke that </v>

873
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:37.471
<v Speaker 2>they're really quite offended by </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary models of disgust proposed </v>

874
00:47:37.471 --> 00:47:41.110
<v Speaker 2>that is emotion helped to evolve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolved to help us avoid contaminated or</v>

875
00:47:41.111 --> 00:47:45.580
<v Speaker 2>harmful foods or other potential sources</v>
<v Speaker 2>of disease such as sexual contact.</v>

876
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Now that's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

877
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:52.440
<v Speaker 2>because there's also an idea that floats</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the general culture and I think </v>

878
00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 2>it's be more elaborated upon partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>since the time of Freud,</v>

879
00:47:55.001 --> 00:48:00.001
<v Speaker 2>but particularly since the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sexual disgust is culturally </v>

880
00:48:00.001 --> 00:48:01.570
<v Speaker 2>produced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can just drop that idea.</v>

881
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:06.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not the case at all any more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed related to food is culturally </v>

882
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:07.810
<v Speaker 2>produced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Culture moves it,</v>

883
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:13.050
<v Speaker 2>but the disgust response to sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact and to food is extremely a </v>

884
00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:18.720
<v Speaker 2>powerful innately and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise everyone would always </v>

885
00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.230
<v Speaker 2>be sleeping with everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there has to.</v>

886
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:25.231
<v Speaker 2>Because obviously sexual contact is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary motivator or something has to </v>

887
00:48:25.231 --> 00:48:28.580
<v Speaker 2>regulate it and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well good sense is what should regulates</v>

888
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:29.050
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

889
00:48:29.051 --> 00:48:30.070
<v Speaker 2>right man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good sense,</v>

890
00:48:30.071 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 2>doesn't regulate good sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't regulate anything,</v>

891
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:38.430
<v Speaker 2>and so there's no way that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen is the regulator for sexual </v>

892
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:40.090
<v Speaker 2>behavior and that's grounded in contempt</v>
<v Speaker 2>and disgust,</v>

893
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:41.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we saw a lot of that in the,</v>

894
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:47.100
<v Speaker 2>in parts of the crumb video that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched because the crumb brothers were </v>

895
00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.970
<v Speaker 2>always being the targets of contempt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgust.</v>

896
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

897
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:52.420
<v Speaker 2>you got to think about why that is too.</v>

898
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.480
<v Speaker 2>It's sexually transmitted diseases are </v>
<v Speaker 2>no joke,</v>

899
00:48:55.990 --> 00:49:00.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't know how long human beings </v>

900
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:02.821
<v Speaker 2>have been plagued by them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can presume that it's pretty </v>

901
00:49:02.821 --> 00:49:02.821
<v Speaker 2>much since the beginning of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

902
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:07.830
<v Speaker 2>mean syphilis was imported from the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>world to the old world and was very,</v>

903
00:49:09.311 --> 00:49:14.311
<v Speaker 2>very hard on Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the reasons that the </v>

904
00:49:14.311 --> 00:49:16.530
<v Speaker 2>victorians were so strict in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual behavior because syphilis was a </v>

905
00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:19.030
<v Speaker 2>nasty disease until we know more or less</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally brought it under control.</v>

906
00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.030
<v Speaker 2>It's quite susceptible to antibiotics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was,</v>

907
00:49:22.031 --> 00:49:24.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transmissible to infants which is also a</v>

908
00:49:24.221 --> 00:49:27.100
<v Speaker 2>major catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course a's,</v>

909
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:32.280
<v Speaker 2>which was the primary vector for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spread of AIDS was promiscuity and the </v>

910
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:37.210
<v Speaker 2>virus evolved could capitalize on </v>
<v Speaker 2>promiscuity because it does that and you</v>

911
00:49:37.211 --> 00:49:39.130
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could easily wiped us out,</v>

912
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:42.760
<v Speaker 2>wiped out tens of millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

913
00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:47.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty smart and got it under </v>

914
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:47.780
<v Speaker 2>control pretty fast.</v>

915
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.520
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways it could have easily been </v>

916
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.790
<v Speaker 2>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also AIDS turned out to be not that </v>

917
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:53.790
<v Speaker 2>easy to catch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:58.140
<v Speaker 2>you actually had to engage in sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>contact and generally you had to engage </v>

919
00:49:58.140 --> 00:50:02.820
<v Speaker 2>in sexual contact of a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonstandard type because the,</v>

920
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:08.190
<v Speaker 2>the most typically used tissues are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>robust to the probability of infection.</v>

921
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.850
<v Speaker 2>So we have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any number of,</v>

922
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:17.970
<v Speaker 2>of there's any number of reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to be disgusted by sexual </v>

923
00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:18.700
<v Speaker 2>contact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

924
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:24.630
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>contended with in addition to its role </v>

925
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:26.920
<v Speaker 2>in directly helping to expel harmful </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods from the body discussed also forms</v>

926
00:50:26.921 --> 00:50:29.180
<v Speaker 2>an important component of the behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 2>immune system,</v>

927
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:34.630
<v Speaker 2>the suite of psychological mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 2>that aid in the detection and avoidance </v>

928
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:37.610
<v Speaker 2>of potential contaminants before they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can make contact with the body.</v>

929
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:42.050
<v Speaker 2>So there's the immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

930
00:50:42.051 --> 00:50:47.051
<v Speaker 2>It attacks invading pathogens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an analog in your behavior </v>

931
00:50:47.051 --> 00:50:49.360
<v Speaker 2>which is that you're unlikely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>

932
00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:53.710
<v Speaker 2>touch and consume anything that happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be disgusting.</v>

933
00:50:53.711 --> 00:50:55.990
<v Speaker 2>And it's a weird system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

934
00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:01.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are unlikely to want to touch a </v>

935
00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:05.311
<v Speaker 2>sterilized cockroach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean one that's unable to </v>

936
00:51:05.311 --> 00:51:05.311
<v Speaker 2>breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

937
00:51:05.311 --> 00:51:09.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean one that that's been treated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>heated so that it's free of </v>

938
00:51:09.001 --> 00:51:09.640
<v Speaker 2>contaminants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't like to do that.</v>

939
00:51:09.641 --> 00:51:12.040
<v Speaker 2>They won't eat and this will hardly come</v>
<v Speaker 2>as any surprise,</v>

940
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:16.150
<v Speaker 2>high quality chocolate molded to </v>
<v Speaker 2>resemble dog feces.</v>

941
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.170
<v Speaker 2>And everyone laughs about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

942
00:51:20.171 --> 00:51:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

943
00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:23.770
<v Speaker 2>So like of course no one would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

944
00:51:23.771 --> 00:51:24.700
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

945
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you cannot attribute that to </v>

946
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:32.341
<v Speaker 2>logic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just attribute to the fact that </v>

947
00:51:32.341 --> 00:51:35.581
<v Speaker 2>you know that if you were in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation how you would feel and the </v>

948
00:51:35.581 --> 00:51:37.300
<v Speaker 2>first thing you would feel is certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>not hungry and then turned off,</v>

949
00:51:37.301 --> 00:51:40.360
<v Speaker 2>which is an interesting way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it because it turned off,</v>

950
00:51:40.361 --> 00:51:44.620
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially a sexual expression </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned off and then you'd feel,</v>

951
00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.170
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd feel like a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

952
00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:52.171
<v Speaker 2>if you ate it right it to yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to anybody who also happened to be </v>

953
00:51:52.171 --> 00:51:56.431
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be something about self </v>

954
00:51:56.431 --> 00:51:57.961
<v Speaker 2>contamination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntary self contamination there that </v>

955
00:51:57.961 --> 00:52:00.340
<v Speaker 2>would make you appear really not very </v>
<v Speaker 2>admirable or honorable.</v>

956
00:52:00.341 --> 00:52:04.480
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the question becomes,</v>

957
00:52:04.481 --> 00:52:09.481
<v Speaker 2>and this is where things get tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just exactly what should you be </v>

958
00:52:09.481 --> 00:52:09.481
<v Speaker 2>disgusted bart.</v>

959
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:17.710
<v Speaker 2>So here's another example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you get people to spit into a </v>

960
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.710
<v Speaker 2>tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

961
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:22.130
<v Speaker 2>to put saliva into a cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will not take it back in their </v>

962
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.130
<v Speaker 2>mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>

963
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:26.831
<v Speaker 2>Well that's kind of strange too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you know what the cup is </v>

964
00:52:26.831 --> 00:52:26.831
<v Speaker 2>sterilized will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

965
00:52:26.831 --> 00:52:27.260
<v Speaker 2>sterilized while it was just in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth,</v>

966
00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:30.560
<v Speaker 2>like half a second before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Hell is wrong with it now?</v>

967
00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:34.160
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is it's no longer in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth and you know,</v>

968
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:39.190
<v Speaker 2>so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an identification of the </v>

969
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:41.540
<v Speaker 2>exterior of the body envelope as one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that defines you and not you.</v>

970
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.730
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the immune system per se.</v>

971
00:52:43.731 --> 00:52:48.731
<v Speaker 2>There's always defining you and not you </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of things that aren't you </v>

972
00:52:48.731 --> 00:52:50.660
<v Speaker 2>and keeping the things that are you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's extended out to our behavior.</v>

973
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:52.280
<v Speaker 2>So you can get.</v>

974
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Here's the sorts of things that Jonathan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haidt has been a discovery hate was </v>

975
00:52:58.281 --> 00:53:01.340
<v Speaker 2>really the guy who did the first major </v>
<v Speaker 2>work on discussed.</v>

976
00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

977
00:53:02.451 --> 00:53:04.500
<v Speaker 2>like two thumbs up for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

978
00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:09.260
<v Speaker 2>he's discovered something genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inducing disgust responses,</v>

979
00:53:09.261 --> 00:53:11.420
<v Speaker 2>whether it via a foul order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a disorder,</v>

980
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:15.230
<v Speaker 2>a disgusting work environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or recalling a disgusting experience led</v>

981
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:20.231
<v Speaker 2>individuals to assign harsher </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishments to others who had committed </v>

982
00:53:20.231 --> 00:53:24.101
<v Speaker 2>moral transgressions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's interesting because what it </v>

983
00:53:24.101 --> 00:53:24.440
<v Speaker 2>also means is that the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting,</v>

984
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.560
<v Speaker 2>at least part is that the core of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we might describe as our desire for </v>

985
00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:33.711
<v Speaker 2>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so which we tend to take as a primarily </v>

986
00:53:33.711 --> 00:53:37.310
<v Speaker 2>cognitive thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the things that we do and </v>

987
00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:39.720
<v Speaker 2>hold dear are not primarily cognitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're grounded in,</v>

988
00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:45.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomena that are deeply embedded </v>

989
00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:48.651
<v Speaker 2>within us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harsh moral judgments can even be </v>

990
00:53:48.651 --> 00:53:51.150
<v Speaker 2>induced following the consumption of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter drake well,</v>

991
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:56.530
<v Speaker 2>poisonous things are often bitter even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though bitter things are sometimes not </v>

992
00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:01.521
<v Speaker 2>poisonous and the bitter flavor evokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed the same disgust related </v>

993
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 2>facial expressions or observed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>response to unpleasant tastes,</v>

994
00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:10.290
<v Speaker 2>disgusting photographs and receiving </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfair treatment in an economic game.</v>

995
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.200
<v Speaker 2>So that basically means that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing imagined,</v>

996
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:17.490
<v Speaker 2>some kids are playing together and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the kids cheese or you might say,</v>

997
00:54:17.491 --> 00:54:19.830
<v Speaker 2>well the other kids are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>angry or they other kids are going to be</v>

998
00:54:19.831 --> 00:54:24.831
<v Speaker 2>upset or the other kids are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxious because they've upset the </v>

999
00:54:24.831 --> 00:54:24.831
<v Speaker 2>structure of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1000
00:54:24.831 --> 00:54:25.290
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe all those things happen,</v>

1001
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:28.470
<v Speaker 2>but one thing that happens as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed,</v>

1002
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 2>it's like how could you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course if you're disgusting,</v>

1003
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:37.190
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>shunted out of the dominance hierarchy </v>

1004
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.290
<v Speaker 2>altogether is pretty damn high.</v>

1005
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Concerns about cleanliness and feelings </v>
<v Speaker 2>of disgust have likewise been related to</v>

1006
00:54:43.101 --> 00:54:46.670
<v Speaker 2>political attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>situational situational reminders of the</v>

1007
00:54:46.671 --> 00:54:51.671
<v Speaker 2>importance of physical cleanliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as asking participants to wipe </v>

1008
00:54:51.671 --> 00:54:54.770
<v Speaker 2>their hands with antiseptic wipes tends </v>
<v Speaker 2>to increase self reported.</v>

1009
00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Political conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a finding is consistent with the </v>

1010
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.320
<v Speaker 2>notion that purity tends to be valued </v>
<v Speaker 2>more highly by conservatives.</v>

1011
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:08.240
<v Speaker 2>Then by liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well for much of human history,</v>

1012
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:14.320
<v Speaker 2>female virginity in particular was </v>
<v Speaker 2>highly valued and sometimes the </v>

1013
00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:18.500
<v Speaker 2>punishments for deviating from that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>and still can be extraordinarily high.</v>

1014
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason why you might ask why</v>

1015
00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:26.120
<v Speaker 2>precisely is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of the reason is an exaggerated</v>

1016
00:55:26.121 --> 00:55:31.121
<v Speaker 2>disgust response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Individuals who report being disgusted </v>

1017
00:55:31.611 --> 00:55:36.611
<v Speaker 2>more easily also tend to hold more </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative political views on topics </v>

1018
00:55:36.611 --> 00:55:37.310
<v Speaker 2>including abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage tax cuts,</v>

1019
00:55:37.311 --> 00:55:41.120
<v Speaker 2>and affirmative action in addition to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the effects that have emerged when using</v>

1020
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:46.190
<v Speaker 2>self-reported disgust sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more conservative political views have </v>

1021
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:49.841
<v Speaker 2>also been associated with stronger </v>
<v Speaker 2>physiological reactivity to disgusting </v>

1022
00:55:49.841 --> 00:55:54.160
<v Speaker 2>images.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1023
00:56:05.291 --> 00:56:10.291
<v Speaker 2>so preferences for order and tradition </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand in preferences for </v>

1024
00:56:10.291 --> 00:56:14.341
<v Speaker 2>egalitarianism on the other appear to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>related to two core dimensions of moral </v>

1025
00:56:15.761 --> 00:56:16.960
<v Speaker 2>values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1026
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:22.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>preferences for order and tradition are </v>

1027
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.351
<v Speaker 2>associated with higher levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>orderliness and as well as lower levels </v>

1028
00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:30.451
<v Speaker 2>of openness and intellect and </v>
<v Speaker 2>preferences for egalitarianism are </v>

1029
00:56:30.451 --> 00:56:32.380
<v Speaker 2>uniquely associated with compassion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of agreeableness.</v>

1030
00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Political conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this is where the claims get </v>

1031
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.050
<v Speaker 2>frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think political conservatism can be </v>

1032
00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:45.991
<v Speaker 2>thought of as a social immune system </v>
<v Speaker 2>reflecting the extension of pathogen </v>

1033
00:56:45.991 --> 00:56:47.830
<v Speaker 2>avoidance mechanisms to the integrity of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social system,</v>

1034
00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:53.280
<v Speaker 2>just as the behavioral immune system has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been conceptualized as helping to </v>

1035
00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.400
<v Speaker 2>maintain the purity and integrity of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual body.</v>

1036
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:59.550
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same pathogen avoidance system </v>

1037
00:56:59.550 --> 00:56:59.980
<v Speaker 2>helped me in the abstract integrity of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social order.</v>

1038
00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:05.340
<v Speaker 2>In particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social immune system would help to </v>

1039
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 2>maintain order by suppressing any </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions or individuals that deviate from</v>

1040
00:57:06.101 --> 00:57:08.140
<v Speaker 2>the groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted social traditions.</v>

1041
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to make a bit of a segue</v>

1042
00:57:12.491 --> 00:57:15.220
<v Speaker 2>here from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has been reported,</v>

1043
00:57:15.221 --> 00:57:20.221
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that regions with higher levels </v>

1044
00:57:20.221 --> 00:57:22.621
<v Speaker 2>of disease prevalence tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with higher levels of social </v>

1045
00:57:22.621 --> 00:57:25.891
<v Speaker 2>conformity and autocratic rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Individuals who feel more vulnerable to </v>

1046
00:57:25.891 --> 00:57:27.790
<v Speaker 2>disease likewise report higher levels of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnocentrism,</v>

1047
00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.850
<v Speaker 2>xenophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's something else to consider,</v>

1048
00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:36.180
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when the Spaniards landed in Central</v>

1049
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:39.400
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

1050
00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:41.930
<v Speaker 1>they had</v>

1051
00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:47.620
<v Speaker 2>being from a European population that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was Ponson traded in cities and the </v>

1052
00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.970
<v Speaker 2>cities were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from our perspective,</v>

1053
00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 2>disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filthy close proximity with animals and </v>

1054
00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:59.210
<v Speaker 2>subject to continual waves of epidemic </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

1055
00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the upside of that for the Europeans was</v>

1056
00:58:01.731 --> 00:58:06.731
<v Speaker 2>that all the ones that didn't die </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed immunity to these various </v>

1057
00:58:06.731 --> 00:58:07.760
<v Speaker 2>diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you know,</v>

1058
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I would suspect that over time it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people who died from one</v>

1059
00:58:13.521 --> 00:58:16.400
<v Speaker 2>epidemic disease or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1060
00:58:16.401 --> 00:58:19.580
<v Speaker 2>so then the Spaniards went to the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1061
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one reason or another,</v>

1062
00:58:22.581 --> 00:58:25.160
<v Speaker 2>there were hardly any epidemic diseases </v>
<v Speaker 2>in North America.</v>

1063
00:58:25.161 --> 00:58:30.161
<v Speaker 2>Now that was partly because of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>relative dearth of domestic animals and </v>

1064
00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:31.910
<v Speaker 2>partly because there weren't as many big</v>
<v Speaker 2>closely packed cities,</v>

1065
00:58:31.911 --> 00:58:36.911
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what the overall reason </v>

1066
00:58:36.911 --> 00:58:36.911
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened?</v>

1067
00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:42.400
<v Speaker 2>All the native Americans died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety five percent of them.</v>

1068
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.730
<v Speaker 2>They died from smallpox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They died from measles.</v>

1069
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:50.731
<v Speaker 2>They died from mumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guide from chicken pox in </v>

1070
00:58:50.731 --> 00:58:54.481
<v Speaker 2>successive waves of epidemic demolish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant centered in Central American </v>

1071
00:58:56.681 --> 00:59:01.681
<v Speaker 2>rating out all across North America and </v>
<v Speaker 2>South America so that by the time the </v>

1072
00:59:01.681 --> 00:59:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Europeans landed in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the Spaniards got there,</v>

1073
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:06.100
<v Speaker 2>say in the late 14 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right early 15 hundreds.</v>

1074
00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:09.010
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who landed at Plymouth Rock,</v>

1075
00:59:09.011 --> 00:59:14.011
<v Speaker 2>and that's kind of often what you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about as the beginning of the European </v>

1076
00:59:14.011 --> 00:59:16.600
<v Speaker 2>colonization of North America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like 100 years later.</v>

1077
00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Well everyone was dead by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are reports that when the,</v>

1078
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:25.890
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the white settlers that religious </v>

1079
00:59:25.890 --> 00:59:27.070
<v Speaker 2>escapees really landed at Plymouth rock </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Datas,</v>

1080
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:32.080
<v Speaker 2>we're happy to see them because there </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't enough people left bringing the </v>

1081
00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:32.080
<v Speaker 2>crops.</v>

1082
00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.090
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why am I telling you this?</v>

1083
00:59:34.091 --> 00:59:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then returned syphilis was delivered</v>

1084
00:59:36.251 --> 00:59:38.230
<v Speaker 2>to Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least that's the theory,</v>

1085
00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:40.460
<v Speaker 2>although it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1086
00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:46.050
<v Speaker 2>there isn't any certainty about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seemed to appear at about the </v>

1087
00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:46.390
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Europeans brought endless numbers</v>

1088
00:59:46.391 --> 00:59:51.391
<v Speaker 2>of horrible diseases to the new world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the new world returned the </v>

1089
00:59:51.391 --> 00:59:52.750
<v Speaker 2>favor with one horrible disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a point here,</v>

1090
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.790
<v Speaker 2>while I'm still in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this still happens,</v>

1091
00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:59.791
<v Speaker 2>so if you go into the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find your tribe that hasn't been </v>

1092
00:59:59.791 --> 01:00:03.211
<v Speaker 2>discovered yet or anywhere else in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and you go up and you shake their </v>

1093
01:00:03.211 --> 01:00:03.211
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1094
01:00:03.211 --> 01:00:04.200
<v Speaker 2>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're all dancing like a month.</v>

1095
01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:07.690
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why is this important?</v>

1096
01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know how often this sort of </v>

1097
01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:15.451
<v Speaker 2>thing has happened in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it could easily be the case that </v>

1098
01:00:15.451 --> 01:00:19.500
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason that people are leery</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people who aren't like them is </v>

1099
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.820
<v Speaker 2>because over our evolutionary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the course of our evolutionary history,</v>

1100
01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:27.060
<v Speaker 2>it was at least moderately probable that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read if you ran into another group </v>

1101
01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:31.801
<v Speaker 2>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they didn't kill you and you </v>

1102
01:00:31.801 --> 01:00:34.471
<v Speaker 2>immediately went to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the mere contact would devastate </v>

1103
01:00:34.471 --> 01:00:34.471
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1104
01:00:34.471 --> 01:00:39.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you can imagine how that sort of </v>

1105
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:41.020
<v Speaker 2>thing would be attributed to things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>magical power of curses or whatever have</v>

1106
01:00:41.021 --> 01:00:46.021
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people are trying to strive for an </v>

1107
01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:47.941
<v Speaker 2>explanation for the phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a nasty little idea.</v>

1108
01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Now check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this study,</v>

1109
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:05.950
<v Speaker 2>according to a parasite stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis,</v>

1110
01:01:05.951 --> 01:01:10.951
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian governments are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to emerge in regions </v>

1111
01:01:10.951 --> 01:01:12.190
<v Speaker 2>characterized by a high prevalence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease causing pathogens.</v>

1112
01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Recent cross national evidence is </v>
<v Speaker 2>consistent with this hypothesis,</v>

1113
01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:19.180
<v Speaker 2>but there are inferential limitations </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with that evidence.</v>

1114
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:22.960
<v Speaker 2>We report to studies that address some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these limitations and provide further</v>

1115
01:01:22.961 --> 01:01:27.961
<v Speaker 2>tests of the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Study one revealed that parasite </v>

1116
01:01:27.961 --> 01:01:32.790
<v Speaker 2>prevalence strongly predicted cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>national differences on measures </v>

1117
01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:34.060
<v Speaker 2>assessing individual's authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities,</v>

1118
01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:39.360
<v Speaker 2>and that this affects the tedious </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistically mediated the relationship </v>

1119
01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.630
<v Speaker 2>between parasite prevalence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian governance.</v>

1120
01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's unpack that.</v>

1121
01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:47.220
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean more disease?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more the people are authoritarian,</v>

1122
01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.560
<v Speaker 2>the more the people are authoritarian at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local level,</v>

1123
01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.360
<v Speaker 2>at the level of their individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs,</v>

1124
01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.910
<v Speaker 2>the more likely the government is to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian.</v>

1125
01:01:55.210 --> 01:02:00.010
<v Speaker 2>So it's disease individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

1126
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's really something study to </v>

1127
01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.940
<v Speaker 2>tested the parasite stress hypothesis.</v>

1128
01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:09.640
<v Speaker 2>In a sample of traditional small scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>

1129
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:14.910
<v Speaker 2>revolt results revealed that parasite </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalence predicted measures of </v>

1130
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:19.021
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian governance and did so </v>
<v Speaker 2>evenly when even when statistically </v>

1131
01:02:19.021 --> 01:02:21.120
<v Speaker 2>controlling for threats to human </v>
<v Speaker 2>welfare,</v>

1132
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:26.070
<v Speaker 2>one additional threat famine also </v>
<v Speaker 2>uniquely predicted authoritarianism.</v>

1133
01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I should also point out that the </v>

1134
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:33.561
<v Speaker 2>historical reasons for famine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're often tightly associated with the </v>

1135
01:02:33.561 --> 01:02:34.530
<v Speaker 2>historical reasons for disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalence,</v>

1136
01:02:34.531 --> 01:02:39.531
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were invaded by racks that are </v>

1137
01:02:39.531 --> 01:02:41.701
<v Speaker 2>going to eat everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>produced and the probability that </v>

1138
01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:41.970
<v Speaker 2>they're going to bring disease along </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them was pretty damn high.</v>

1139
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Look at the correlations together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These results further substantiate the </v>

1140
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:51.051
<v Speaker 2>parasite stress hypothesis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism and suggested that </v>

1141
01:02:51.051 --> 01:02:54.561
<v Speaker 2>societal differences in authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>governance result in part from cultural </v>

1142
01:02:54.561 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 2>differences in individual's </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian personalities.</v>

1143
01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the correlation between </v>

1144
01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:02.260
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian governance and pathogen </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalence?</v>

1145
01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Point four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to remember what we said about effect </v>

1146
01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:07.160
<v Speaker 2>sizes.</v>

1147
01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.040
<v Speaker 2>That's as powerful an effect as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship between Iq and grades.</v>

1148
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:16.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a whopping effect and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of error in these </v>

1149
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:19.821
<v Speaker 2>measurements so you can be sure that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>true correlation is higher famine was </v>

1150
01:03:20.041 --> 01:03:22.860
<v Speaker 2>also associated with authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>governance.</v>

1151
01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so wow,</v>

1152
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I read that paper and I thought really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could that really be the case?</v>

1153
01:03:30.631 --> 01:03:35.631
<v Speaker 2>Is that what happens is that especially </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the incidence of transmissible </v>

1154
01:03:35.631 --> 01:03:39.501
<v Speaker 2>diseases increase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people clamp down on their moral </v>

1155
01:03:39.501 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 2>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't let you know.</v>

1156
01:03:40.051 --> 01:03:43.770
<v Speaker 2>They don't allow contact between each </v>
<v Speaker 2>with between.</v>

1157
01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:46.290
<v Speaker 2>They tightened the borders at every </v>
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

1158
01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.300
<v Speaker 2>at every level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexual,</v>

1159
01:03:48.301 --> 01:03:50.670
<v Speaker 2>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>familial,</v>

1160
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.580
<v Speaker 2>at the level of the village,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the level of the state,</v>

1161
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.640
<v Speaker 2>they closed the borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know when you can think of the </v>

1162
01:03:58.640 --> 01:03:58.710
<v Speaker 2>ultimate border as the surface of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin?</v>

1163
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is very few people.</v>

1164
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:05.630
<v Speaker 2>There are very few people who believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that border should be so open that they </v>

1165
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:08.940
<v Speaker 2>don't want control over the border of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own skin.</v>

1166
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.770
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1167
01:04:10.771 --> 01:04:13.500
<v Speaker 2>how far out should that be extended in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer to that is,</v>

1168
01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:14.610
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's debatable,</v>

1169
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:20.180
<v Speaker 2>but there's obviously a limit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>universality of access and there's a </v>

1170
01:04:22.831 --> 01:04:24.150
<v Speaker 2>reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1171
01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:26.700
<v Speaker 2>there's multiple reasons for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this appears to be one of them.</v>

1172
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:29.010
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that indicates,</v>

1173
01:04:29.011 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 2>and this is mind boggling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would have guessed this,</v>

1174
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:37.070
<v Speaker 2>is that perhaps the best way to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism across the world is to </v>

1175
01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:41.211
<v Speaker 2>institute effective public health </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs and get rid of the infectious </v>

1176
01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:41.550
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now who would have guessed that?</v>

1177
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.650
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1178
01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:47.810
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense to some degree if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>general level of danger and threat is </v>

1179
01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:53.780
<v Speaker 2>actually lowered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe people don't have to be so </v>

1180
01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:56.220
<v Speaker 2>defensive and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and judgmental and,</v>

1181
01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:59.630
<v Speaker 2>and xenophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1182
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:05.630
<v Speaker 2>we think often that it's political </v>
<v Speaker 2>argumentation that does this sort of </v>

1183
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.630
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1184
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:08.130
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no malaria in North America.</v>

1185
01:05:08.131 --> 01:05:10.240
<v Speaker 2>There is no malaria in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

1186
01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:11.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 years ago,</v>

1187
01:05:11.911 --> 01:05:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston,</v>

1188
01:05:13.111 --> 01:05:15.840
<v Speaker 2>those places were malarial pits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1189
01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:18.770
<v Speaker 2>but it was public health programs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>got rid of almost all of that.</v>

1190
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:24.010
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we're all liberal and friendly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we don't have any infectious </v>

1191
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:24.010
<v Speaker 2>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would not be something.</v>

1192
01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.490
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our point four,</v>

1193
01:05:26.491 --> 01:05:28.610
<v Speaker 2>two correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a big study to,</v>

1194
01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.880
<v Speaker 2>that's a big correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a correlation like that.</v>

1195
01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Especially think about the probability </v>
<v Speaker 2>that those things would be related,</v>

1196
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:37.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One's a self report,</v>

1197
01:05:37.971 --> 01:05:42.971
<v Speaker 2>measure of political belief and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other is a public health measure of </v>

1198
01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:46.421
<v Speaker 2>disease prevalence and the probability </v>
<v Speaker 2>that those things would be associated </v>

1199
01:05:46.421 --> 01:05:46.880
<v Speaker 2>just fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1200
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.990
<v Speaker 2>you would just never guess that unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you came to it the hard way through this</v>

1201
01:05:50.991 --> 01:05:54.650
<v Speaker 2>entire logic that we just discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1202
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:55.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1203
01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:02.500
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1204
01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:07.501
<v Speaker 2>I was going through this literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was also reading Hitler's table talk </v>

1205
01:06:07.501 --> 01:06:11.671
<v Speaker 2>and Hitler's table talk was a collection</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his spontaneous speeches delivered </v>

1206
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:17.040
<v Speaker 2>over the dinner table from 1939 to 1942,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was roughly the period where the </v>

1207
01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.541
<v Speaker 2>Nazis were winning the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I noticed something that I haven't </v>

1208
01:06:21.541 --> 01:06:25.321
<v Speaker 2>noticed before and what I noticed before</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that Hitler had a very powerful </v>

1209
01:06:25.321 --> 01:06:28.030
<v Speaker 2>behavioral immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what did that mean?</v>

1210
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.430
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1211
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:32.050
<v Speaker 2>you often hear that the Nazis </v>
<v Speaker 2>annihilated that.</v>

1212
01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:35.440
<v Speaker 2>The people that they annihilated because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were afraid of them,</v>

1213
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:38.140
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you think about Nazis,</v>

1214
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:39.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think,</v>

1215
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:41.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe fear wasn't there.</v>

1216
01:06:41.501 --> 01:06:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Overwhelming characteristic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1217
01:06:44.170 --> 01:06:46.810
<v Speaker 2>it's some more like brutality or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1218
01:06:46.811 --> 01:06:51.811
<v Speaker 2>But it's not fear there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't picture them trembling in </v>

1219
01:06:51.811 --> 01:06:51.811
<v Speaker 2>their boots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1220
01:06:51.811 --> 01:06:52.330
<v Speaker 2>down in the basement or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1221
01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:54.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1222
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

1223
01:06:55.971 --> 01:07:00.971
<v Speaker 2>so I was reading this book and Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 2>was very high in openness by the way,</v>

1224
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:08.080
<v Speaker 2>and very high in orderliness by all </v>
<v Speaker 2>appearances and so he his vision for the</v>

1225
01:07:08.081 --> 01:07:09.970
<v Speaker 2>area and race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he had this race,</v>

1226
01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:11.080
<v Speaker 2>racial theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1227
01:07:11.081 --> 01:07:16.081
<v Speaker 2>and the racial theory was that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper inhabitants of Europe and </v>

1228
01:07:16.081 --> 01:07:19.530
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically the world were blond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue eyed areas which,</v>

1229
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:25.340
<v Speaker 2>which is really not a category and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the world would be a better </v>

1230
01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 2>place if they were the dominant group </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the other groups were gone.</v>

1231
01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Also then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how did Hitler conceptualize this </v>

1232
01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:39.811
<v Speaker 2>area and rates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the answer is he conceptualized it </v>

1233
01:07:39.811 --> 01:07:42.811
<v Speaker 2>as a body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the body of the was the body of </v>

1234
01:07:42.811 --> 01:07:47.011
<v Speaker 2>the area and race and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptualized all the people that he </v>

1235
01:07:47.011 --> 01:07:49.150
<v Speaker 2>was out to annihilate as parasitical </v>
<v Speaker 2>invaders.</v>

1236
01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:54.780
<v Speaker 2>And so Hitler's metaphor for the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>genocide wasn't fear.</v>

1237
01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:01.440
<v Speaker 2>It was discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a whole different idea.</v>

1238
01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Now let me tell you some things about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1239
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:09.100
<v Speaker 2>in with regards to the orderly part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1240
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.480
<v Speaker 2>you can just check out the</v>

1241
01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:12.860
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

1242
01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:23.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just not going to see a more </v>

1243
01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:23.700
<v Speaker 2>orderly gathering the people than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture on the right.</v>

1244
01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Nuremberg,</v>

1245
01:08:25.311 --> 01:08:30.311
<v Speaker 2>which was the prime place where the Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 2>staged their celebrations was the </v>

1246
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:34.220
<v Speaker 2>biggest gathering field ever made in </v>
<v Speaker 2>human history.</v>

1247
01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:39.850
<v Speaker 2>People arrange themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of people into </v>

1248
01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:40.850
<v Speaker 2>perfect squares,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

1249
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:45.910
<v Speaker 2>and you remember the Jackboot goosestep </v>
<v Speaker 2>March and the Hail Hitler.</v>

1250
01:08:46.161 --> 01:08:51.161
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's all done an absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect sequence and Hitler was a great </v>

1251
01:08:51.161 --> 01:08:53.990
<v Speaker 2>admirer of willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very happy that he could stand in</v>

1252
01:08:53.991 --> 01:08:58.991
<v Speaker 2>the back of his car for eight hours and </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep his hand out like this and he </v>

1253
01:08:58.991 --> 01:09:02.720
<v Speaker 2>bathed four times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you saw,</v>

1254
01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:08.020
<v Speaker 2>what seems to have driven what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Nazi Germany and perhaps is one of </v>

1255
01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:13.361
<v Speaker 2>the things that drive right wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>political movements to this day is </v>

1256
01:09:13.361 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 2>heightened sensitivity to discussed.</v>

1257
01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how it all got going and this is </v>

1258
01:09:22.230 --> 01:09:24.991
<v Speaker 2>a very brief overview and many other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things happened when Hitler came to </v>

1259
01:09:24.991 --> 01:09:27.030
<v Speaker 2>power and that was about 1933 </v>
<v Speaker 2>thereabouts.</v>

1260
01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:32.790
<v Speaker 2>He put into place a variety of public </v>
<v Speaker 2>health initiatives and one of them for </v>

1261
01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:37.471
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he built these vans that had x ray </v>

1262
01:09:37.471 --> 01:09:41.011
<v Speaker 2>machines in them and he went around </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and screen people for </v>

1263
01:09:41.011 --> 01:09:41.470
<v Speaker 2>tuberculosis seemed like a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1264
01:09:41.471 --> 01:09:46.471
<v Speaker 2>And then one of the things he did after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was go on a factory beautification </v>

1265
01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:48.640
<v Speaker 2>being punished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

1266
01:09:48.641 --> 01:09:53.641
<v Speaker 2>And so partly that was driven by </v>
<v Speaker 2>openness because he wanted things to be </v>

1267
01:09:53.641 --> 01:09:57.031
<v Speaker 2>aesthetically pleasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it was driven by </v>

1268
01:09:57.031 --> 01:09:59.251
<v Speaker 2>orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're supposed to go into your </v>

1269
01:09:59.251 --> 01:10:01.411
<v Speaker 2>factory and sweep the damn thing out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix the yard in front of it and plant </v>

1270
01:10:01.411 --> 01:10:02.050
<v Speaker 2>some flowers and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it a look.</v>

1271
01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:05.470
<v Speaker 2>All Nice and suburban and under control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

1272
01:10:05.471 --> 01:10:06.390
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1273
01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:10.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe still not such a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1274
01:10:10.690 --> 01:10:13.960
<v Speaker 2>when you go into your factory while </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's rats there and there's like bugs</v>

1275
01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:16.000
<v Speaker 2>and things that shouldn't be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe you think,</v>

1276
01:10:16.001 --> 01:10:17.740
<v Speaker 2>well let's get rid of the rats and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bugs.</v>

1277
01:10:17.741 --> 01:10:22.741
<v Speaker 2>And so then you use an insecticide spray</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that spray happened to be Zyklon B,</v>

1278
01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:28.470
<v Speaker 2>which will return to you momentarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>while so after that then hit their </v>

1279
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:31.800
<v Speaker 2>window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a euthanasia kick and it was sort of </v>

1280
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:31.800
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1281
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.750
<v Speaker 2>we can get rid of the people who are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing and you know,</v>

1282
01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:39.280
<v Speaker 2>who are not fit to live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shall we say.</v>

1283
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:45.030
<v Speaker 2>And so that started with euthanasia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so it started with people who were in </v>

1284
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:48.451
<v Speaker 2>mental hospitals for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people who had biological </v>

1285
01:10:48.451 --> 01:10:52.081
<v Speaker 2>intellectual deficits and such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from there it went to people have </v>

1286
01:10:52.971 --> 01:10:55.730
<v Speaker 2>the wrong religious tradition and from </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1287
01:10:55.731 --> 01:11:00.731
<v Speaker 2>and that was first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only being rounded up and herded into </v>

1288
01:11:00.731 --> 01:11:00.731
<v Speaker 2>camps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1289
01:11:00.731 --> 01:11:04.271
<v Speaker 2>or first deprived of your property and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have your identity and then rounded up </v>

1290
01:11:04.271 --> 01:11:07.841
<v Speaker 2>and put and put into camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what it ended up with was genocidal </v>

1291
01:11:07.841 --> 01:11:11.000
<v Speaker 2>annihilation in gas chambers with Ziflow</v>
<v Speaker 2>on B.</v>

1292
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1293
01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis would describe the people that</v>

1294
01:11:16.201 --> 01:11:21.201
<v Speaker 2>they were tormenting as parasites and as</v>
<v Speaker 2>insects and as rats.</v>

1295
01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:28.320
<v Speaker 2>And that's not fear language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's discussed language.</v>

1296
01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.890
<v Speaker 2>And so it's an appalling</v>

1297
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.580
<v Speaker 2>paradox because the behavioral immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1298
01:11:38.581 --> 01:11:43.581
<v Speaker 2>along with the immune system is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to stop people from dying right</v>

1299
01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:47.730
<v Speaker 2>in your immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguishes between you and not you,</v>

1300
01:11:47.731 --> 01:11:50.340
<v Speaker 2>and you do the same thing at many levels</v>
<v Speaker 2>of behavior,</v>

1301
01:11:50.341 --> 01:11:55.341
<v Speaker 2>especially sexually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know who's going to say that </v>

1302
01:11:55.341 --> 01:11:56.010
<v Speaker 2>there's anything wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing when you try to keep</v>

1303
01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:59.010
<v Speaker 2>your bathroom cleaning your kitchen </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean and the city streets clean and all</v>

1304
01:11:59.011 --> 01:12:00.240
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you think,</v>

1305
01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:01.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all the good.</v>

1306
01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:02.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1307
01:12:02.341 --> 01:12:04.920
<v Speaker 2>but look what happens when that gets out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of control,</v>

1308
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:10.580
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a terrible thing in a sense </v>

1309
01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.621
<v Speaker 2>because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing if something that's bad </v>

1310
01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:15.090
<v Speaker 2>in and of itself gets out of hand and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then make something really bad,</v>

1311
01:12:15.091 --> 01:12:17.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's really a whole different </v>
<v Speaker 2>category of awful.</v>

1312
01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.880
<v Speaker 2>When something appears to be pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're only for benefit and it gets out</v>

1313
01:12:22.891 --> 01:12:27.891
<v Speaker 2>of control and it gets so horrible that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it produces worse effects and the </v>

1314
01:12:27.891 --> 01:12:28.590
<v Speaker 2>effects that it was designed to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1315
01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I want to just show you a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a film that goes along with this.</v>

1316
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an example of Nazi order as </v>

1317
01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.751
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's at Nuremberg and I need to </v>

1318
01:12:47.751 --> 01:12:48.210
<v Speaker 2>explain this picture to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Nuremberg field was massive,</v>

1319
01:12:48.211 --> 01:12:50.400
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see those curtains,</v>

1320
01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:55.200
<v Speaker 2>those are lights and the lights are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>search lights from the Luftwaffe,</v>

1321
01:12:55.201 --> 01:12:57.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the Nazi air force.</v>

1322
01:12:57.511 --> 01:13:01.440
<v Speaker 2>And Hitler would put those up behind him</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was speaking.</v>

1323
01:13:01.441 --> 01:13:06.441
<v Speaker 2>And so then he'd be have a curtain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lights behind them that stretched up so </v>

1324
01:13:06.441 --> 01:13:08.250
<v Speaker 2>high into the sky that you couldn't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of them.</v>

1325
01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:10.690
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was organized out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1326
01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:11.880
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1327
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.830
<v Speaker 2>on the marching field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1328
01:13:13.831 --> 01:13:16.650
<v Speaker 2>there's a good example there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at those people on the left top,</v>

1329
01:13:16.651 --> 01:13:21.510
<v Speaker 2>left there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're organized in multiple dimensions</v>

1330
01:13:21.511 --> 01:13:26.511
<v Speaker 2>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on the right you see a </v>

1331
01:13:26.511 --> 01:13:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Nuremberg parade ground and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of people there.</v>

1332
01:13:28.051 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 2>And they're all in absolutely perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>corridors.</v>

1333
01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:38.890
<v Speaker 2>And these are comments from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Hitler and from the Nazis.</v>

1334
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:45.990
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world will recognize the Jew as </v>

1335
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:47.911
<v Speaker 2>world parasite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there will become a time when there </v>

1336
01:13:47.911 --> 01:13:48.400
<v Speaker 2>will be one united front of all people </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the Jewish world,</v>

1337
01:13:48.401 --> 01:13:53.401
<v Speaker 2>parasite and humanity will be freed from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most severe illness from which he </v>

1338
01:13:53.401 --> 01:13:55.220
<v Speaker 2>suffered for thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1339
01:13:55.221 --> 01:14:00.221
<v Speaker 2>and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's some quotes from Hitler from a </v>

1340
01:14:00.221 --> 01:14:01.480
<v Speaker 2>paper called Hitler's ideology embodied </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphor,</v>

1341
01:14:01.481 --> 01:14:02.590
<v Speaker 2>fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In history,</v>

1342
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:08.140
<v Speaker 2>the state did not power possess the </v>
<v Speaker 2>power to manifest the disease.</v>

1343
01:14:08.141 --> 01:14:13.141
<v Speaker 2>The menacing decay of the right was </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest politicians tinkering around on</v>

1344
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:19.711
<v Speaker 2>the German national body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most of the forms of our general </v>

1345
01:14:19.711 --> 01:14:23.191
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but blindly ignored the virus at the </v>

1346
01:14:23.191 --> 01:14:26.521
<v Speaker 2>time of the unification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The inner decay was already in full </v>

1347
01:14:26.521 --> 01:14:28.450
<v Speaker 2>swing and the general situation was </v>
<v Speaker 2>deteriorating from year to year.</v>

1348
01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.300
<v Speaker 2>The station did not grow inwardly </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthier,</v>

1349
01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:36.301
<v Speaker 2>but obviously languished more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The symptoms of decay of the prewar </v>

1350
01:14:36.301 --> 01:14:37.930
<v Speaker 2>period can be reduced to racial causes.</v>

1351
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who wants to cure this era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was inwardly sick and rotten,</v>

1352
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:47.790
<v Speaker 2>must first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sum up the courage to make clear the </v>

1353
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:50.191
<v Speaker 2>causes of this disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that they must demonstrate </v>

1354
01:14:50.191 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 2>that they are ready for appeasement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as to stay the deadly cancerous ulcer</v>

1355
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:58.201
<v Speaker 2>through a policy of moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this battle should not come Germany </v>

1356
01:14:58.201 --> 01:15:01.030
<v Speaker 2>with decay and at best would sync to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruin like a rotting corpse.</v>

1357
01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Now you get the idea and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting to me because you </v>

1358
01:15:07.391 --> 01:15:12.391
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a straight psychological </v>

1359
01:15:12.391 --> 01:15:12.391
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it psychometric you know,</v>

1360
01:15:12.391 --> 01:15:16.051
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden out of that comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>this finding that orderliness is linked </v>

1361
01:15:16.051 --> 01:15:17.950
<v Speaker 2>to conservatism and it's linked to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral immune system and Poof,</v>

1362
01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.530
<v Speaker 2>you have a completely new explanation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for what happened with the Nazis.</v>

1363
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:27.510
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what happens when orderliness </v>

1364
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:32.281
<v Speaker 2>gets out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting too because the </v>

1365
01:15:32.281 --> 01:15:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Germans are known for their orderliness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for their engineering prowess,</v>

1366
01:15:33.210 --> 01:15:38.210
<v Speaker 2>know for the organization and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleanliness and freedom from corruption </v>

1367
01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:43.081
<v Speaker 2>of their political state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet this is what happens when it's </v>

1368
01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:43.540
<v Speaker 2>taken to an extreme.</v>
