1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was a couple of things that I </v>

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.931
<v Speaker 1>wanted to tell you that were left open </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last lecture.</v>

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 1>The first one was that I told you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there were two types of games and then I</v>

4
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:18.801
<v Speaker 1>only told you about one type of games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know you've all been dying of </v>

5
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.221
<v Speaker 1>curiosity about that ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first type of game that we talked</v>

6
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>about was the one where everyone has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly shared goal.</v>

7
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>You might think of that as a structured </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.120
<v Speaker 1>but the second type of game that Piaget </v>
<v Speaker 1>was interested in was a dramatic or </v>

9
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.121
<v Speaker 1>pretend play games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generally how a pretend play episode</v>

10
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:43.731
<v Speaker 1>works is that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while our child can all always do this </v>

11
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>by him or herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a group game,</v>

12
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:49.971
<v Speaker 1>usually what happens is the kids get </v>
<v Speaker 1>together a little group and they </v>

13
00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>basically script out a little plane and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

14
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you call it,</v>

15
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous improvisation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

16
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe they'll play house and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they assign,</v>

17
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

18
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>a player to each role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that would normally be </v>

19
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.271
<v Speaker 1>mother and father and baby often and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe pet dog or cat,</v>

20
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:13.971
<v Speaker 1>so you know you can be the cat and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be the mom and you can be the day I </v>

21
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll set up a little dramatic </v>

22
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>arena and maybe it's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cable covered with blankets which</v>

23
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:24.921
<v Speaker 1>kids seem to particularly like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll run through the game </v>

24
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>now and in some sense what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is imitating their parents or maybe </v>

25
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>their pat or maybe the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not exactly imitation.</v>

26
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:38.811
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is an important thing to note </v>

27
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>because imitation would imply if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitating someone,</v>

28
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>what your incense doing is duplicating </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they just did.</v>

29
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Now there are robots for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you want to teach the robot how </v>

30
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the robots got an arm.</v>

31
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>In fact it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can grab it's arm and you can go </v>

32
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

33
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.470
<v Speaker 1>And then as long as you put a cam there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the robot will do exactly that precisely</v>

34
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your teaching,</v>

35
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 1>if it has the capability of imitating </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements that it's already done once.</v>

36
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.220
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a kid and you're playing </v>

37
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.860
<v Speaker 1>house and maybe you're being the mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't precisely duplicate with your </v>

38
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.350
<v Speaker 1>body exactly the movements that you saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mother make,</v>

39
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe the last time you saw her or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last time you were watching her.</v>

40
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>What did you seem to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead is to watch your mother over </v>

41
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>long periods of time and extract out </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you might describe as her</v>

42
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:38.681
<v Speaker 1>spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that that's not really a </v>

43
00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>psychological or a scientific word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a useful word because.</v>

44
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Or You could perhaps say her </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

45
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:48.251
<v Speaker 1>but it's not her personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly because it's her personality as </v>

46
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't really her personality.</v>

47
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.970
<v Speaker 1>It's the mother personality and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother personality is something that has</v>

48
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:59.981
<v Speaker 1>been practiced by mothers for who knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>how long and what the child seems to do </v>

49
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>when she will say for this example is </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching her mother,</v>

50
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>is extract out what the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherhood is and then embody that.</v>

51
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think of this spirit of</v>

52
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:17.221
<v Speaker 1>motherhood as those elements of behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perception and emotion and cognition</v>

53
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's an,</v>

54
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.260
<v Speaker 1>it's an embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those embodied simultaneously </v>

55
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>what's in common across all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>instances of acting like a mother,</v>

56
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could say,</v>

57
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>well that's mother like behavior and who</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what that might be.</v>

58
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:39.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do is conjure up the </v>

59
00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>stereotype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking of a mother,</v>

60
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't really like stereotypes,</v>

61
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:48.571
<v Speaker 1>especially in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but almost all your thinking is in </v>

62
00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:48.571
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes.</v>

63
00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:51.840
<v Speaker 1>So there's not much difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stereotype and a category or </v>

64
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>categories are oversimplifications and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so our stereotypes.</v>

65
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you take management the stereotype of</v>

66
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:02.461
<v Speaker 1>a mother and then the child is acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that out and what they're trying to do </v>

67
00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>is to become the mother roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>

68
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why?</v>

69
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for obvious reasons,</v>

70
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>there's obvious reasons why someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do that.</v>

71
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>It's because without mothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be any human beings.</v>

72
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:17.701
<v Speaker 1>And so if we didn't have successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers then that would be the end of </v>

73
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we wouldn't be here to talk about</v>

74
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:22.891
<v Speaker 1>it so that now one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget observed was this kind of </v>

75
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>dramatic play was extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to children because it,</v>

76
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>it helped them learn how to act like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would act maybe when they're older </v>

77
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>children or maybe when they're teenagers</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe when they're young adults.</v>

78
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a trial run in a relatively safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

79
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.320
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I'd be thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to precisely specify </v>

80
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.431
<v Speaker 1>the role of a father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really believe that one of the </v>

81
00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:50.431
<v Speaker 1>things that fathers do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they do a good job being fathers,</v>

82
00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:55.101
<v Speaker 1>is that they circumscribe a safe space </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the house or within the familial </v>

83
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>environment where the children can play </v>
<v Speaker 1>free of interference.</v>

84
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.370
<v Speaker 1>And so then because play is also a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive behavior,</v>

85
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.680
<v Speaker 1>but by which I mean that it's easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupt play in children.</v>

86
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>If there's anything wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

87
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 1>they won't play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the ways that you can tell if </v>

88
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 1>your child is doing well is that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>

89
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you could say the same thing </v>

90
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:23.371
<v Speaker 1>about your dog or maybe even your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>

91
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:27.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're in a playful mood than </v>

92
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>perhaps there isn't anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly wrong with the relationship</v>

93
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:32.731
<v Speaker 1>at the moment on all their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the needs that might be regarded as </v>

94
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:36.480
<v Speaker 1>in some sense more fundamental have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>met and so to get children to play well </v>

95
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.891
<v Speaker 1>you have to circumscribe a safe area and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be taken care of and then </v>

96
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>they can experiment with different modes</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Ba and they do that by themselves,</v>

97
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:48.781
<v Speaker 1>but they also do that in the company of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other children and obviously what </v>

98
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.020
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is practicing for later </v>
<v Speaker 1>roles and you know,</v>

99
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>you see this sort of thing and children </v>
<v Speaker 1>at multiple levels because not only will</v>

100
00:05:55.541 --> 00:06:00.541
<v Speaker 1>they play out being a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very common element of child's </v>

101
00:06:00.541 --> 00:06:04.961
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll also often develop sort of </v>

102
00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>fixations on slightly older children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a year older or two,</v>

103
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.050
<v Speaker 1>two years older and sort of hero worship</v>
<v Speaker 1>that worship them and follow them around</v>

104
00:06:11.051 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and imitate them even more directly than</v>

105
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:14.560
<v Speaker 1>they might imitate a parrot.</v>

106
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the child has his or her </v>

107
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that and the reasons are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they're trying to advance to the next</v>

108
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:25.661
<v Speaker 1>stage so they scan the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for someone who seems to have done </v>

109
00:06:25.661 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means,</v>

110
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who looks competent and has maybe </v>

111
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.150
<v Speaker 1>friendly and who could tolerate having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid trailed along behind them and then </v>

112
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.141
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they act them out and so play all the </v>

113
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:43.091
<v Speaker 1>forms of play that we described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two basic forms are extremely </v>

114
00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:46.691
<v Speaker 1>important to children and when you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>them pretending it as a parent,</v>

115
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:51.821
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize is that it's an extraordinarily </v>

116
00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>important form of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how they socialize themselves.</v>

117
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I didn't mention,</v>

118
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>this is going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is concentrating on piaget as well.</v>

119
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:05.531
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked a little bit in the </v>

120
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:07.901
<v Speaker 1>mythological and shamanic initiation </v>
<v Speaker 1>lectures about the idea that human </v>

121
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 1>personality evolution is a punctuated </v>
<v Speaker 1>upward development.</v>

122
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 1>So he moved ahead and then you encounter</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that gets in your way,</v>

123
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:23.381
<v Speaker 1>some sort of severe obstacle and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>either blocks you behaviorally so that </v>

124
00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:28.001
<v Speaker 1>you can't get to your goal using your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current behavioral plans or it's even </v>

125
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>more complex than that and it disrupts </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole structure that you're using to</v>

126
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>integrate your behavior across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

127
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:40.901
<v Speaker 1>So the difference between that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly be the difference between say </v>

128
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 1>going home to your partner or going on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>date with your partner suit me.</v>

129
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 1>People still do such things are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with your partner and them being in </v>

130
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.441
<v Speaker 1>an irritable mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that would mean is that </v>

131
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:56.381
<v Speaker 1>maybe you smile at them or you tell them</v>
<v Speaker 1>a joke and you know it falls flat or </v>

132
00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 1>they responded in an angry manner and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to orient to that.</v>

133
00:07:57.921 --> 00:07:59.720
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make things fall apart a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

134
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

135
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:05.321
<v Speaker 1>the whole night's ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably don't say the whole </v>

136
00:08:05.321 --> 00:08:05.870
<v Speaker 1>relationship has had it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if that happens enough times,</v>

137
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:06.770
<v Speaker 1>you might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you might say,</v>

138
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole night's ruined.</v>

139
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is probably a bit of an </v>

140
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.091
<v Speaker 1>overreaction right off the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my impression as a clinician is </v>

141
00:08:16.091 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 1>that when people are being difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get along with,</v>

142
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:23.111
<v Speaker 1>you should let them do it three times </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you track it because then the </v>

143
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>third time they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

144
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done this,</v>

145
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>here's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

146
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:28.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

147
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>And you say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes you are because I saw you do it then</v>

148
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 1>and then and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're basically screwed.</v>

149
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:38.510
<v Speaker 1>You win right away if you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

150
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 1>but more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more seriously.</v>

151
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 1>If it's just one little episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's best to let it go.</v>

152
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have any proof and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's just some,</v>

153
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local thing wrong three times.</v>

154
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:56.201
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different issue because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've got some credibility and </v>

155
00:08:56.201 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice balance between being too </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsively reactive,</v>

156
00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you should stand up for </v>

157
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:02.950
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

158
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that mean that you should respond </v>

159
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:05.270
<v Speaker 1>to every little slight while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be reacting all the time if you</v>

160
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.981
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to be a pushover and </v>

161
00:09:09.981 --> 00:09:12.141
<v Speaker 1>let people walk all over you so you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find some balance between being </v>

162
00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>tolerant so you don't have unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights and being tough so that you don't</v>

163
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>have unnecessary fights and three is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice number anyways,</v>

164
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.100
<v Speaker 1>so you're with your partner and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>being annoying and you know you can </v>

165
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 1>reconstruct your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe instead of telling jokes,</v>

166
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 1>you look at your phone and let them calm</v>
<v Speaker 1>down or something like that.</v>

167
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.280
<v Speaker 1>You haven't disrupted much of the frame </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're using to interact with them </v>

168
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The night the evening is still </v>

169
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.070
<v Speaker 1>continuing in its planned manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can still use the perceptual </v>

170
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 1>structures and the expectations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were guiding you.</v>

171
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.640
<v Speaker 1>They're modified at a very high </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution minor level and then so </v>

172
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>that's going to upset you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to think,</v>

173
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>you know what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll think,</v>

174
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:56.680
<v Speaker 1>is there something wrong with me or are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you going to.</v>

175
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.760
<v Speaker 1>If you're self conscious will do that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll think that there's </v>

176
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:01.760
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

177
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you know,</v>

178
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe you go on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

179
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.640
<v Speaker 1>you're out with your partner and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.560
<v Speaker 1>some person wanders over your </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants,</v>

181
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 1>a person wanders over to the table and </v>
<v Speaker 1>says hello to your partner.</v>

182
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that you had a girlfriend </v>
<v Speaker 1>or boyfriend,</v>

183
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't tell me that when we went out</v>

184
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 1>last week.</v>

185
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be a whole different </v>

186
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:27.740
<v Speaker 1>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

187
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you all laugh about that because you</v>

188
00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>know perfectly well that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different scenario.</v>

189
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

190
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:36.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is the one scenario more disrupting </v>

191
00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:40.130
<v Speaker 1>than the other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An answer to that is something like if </v>

192
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.190
<v Speaker 1>your presuppositions about the world are</v>
<v Speaker 1>arranged in a hierarchy in a sense,</v>

193
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>so that the little actions that you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do something or at the very bottom of</v>

194
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:54.111
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the micro details and then you </v>

195
00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 1>continue to abstract art all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top,</v>

196
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:58.550
<v Speaker 1>which might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a committed relationship now.</v>

197
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.430
<v Speaker 1>There's levels of hierarchy going from </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in a committed relationship to the</v>

198
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 1>little options that you undertake with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>

199
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 1>The higher up you you have to go in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

200
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.930
<v Speaker 1>the higher up the disruption occurs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hierarchical level,</v>

201
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 1>the more upset you're going to beat.</v>

202
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 1>So irritable partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

203
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:21.690
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of walk around that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfaithful partner.</v>

204
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:27.501
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much up at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy where you have to start </v>

206
00:11:27.501 --> 00:11:30.351
<v Speaker 1>rethinking your past and your present </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your future and maybe who you are </v>

207
00:11:30.351 --> 00:11:31.500
<v Speaker 1>and who they are and who men are and who</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are.</v>

208
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

209
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:33.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

210
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:34.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

211
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Everything falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then that's the little trip to the </v>

212
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.351
<v Speaker 1>underworld that we talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Piaget had an idea like that also </v>

213
00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 1>with regards to children because his </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage theory is a punctuated theory.</v>

214
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:50.451
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he noted about </v>
<v Speaker 1>children with that was that they would </v>

215
00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:52.830
<v Speaker 1>construct a structure and a structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>

216
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

217
00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>the best way to think about it as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a personality,</v>

218
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.260
<v Speaker 1>because the personality has thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions and motivations and action.</v>

219
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:07.270
<v Speaker 1>So all of those at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this little alive sub element of </v>

220
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.311
<v Speaker 1>view and the children's children are </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjuring up these little sub elements </v>

221
00:12:11.311 --> 00:12:15.691
<v Speaker 1>of themselves that have functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility as they build themselves from </v>

222
00:12:15.691 --> 00:12:15.691
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

223
00:12:15.691 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 1>from their motor systems upwards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

224
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 1>and then they run into a situation where</v>

225
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.200
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

226
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.850
<v Speaker 1>tools that they've built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subpersonalities that they built </v>

227
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>aren't fulfilling the desired function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that'll happen when,</v>

228
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:32.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

229
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a three year old goes to kindergarten </v>

230
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.351
<v Speaker 1>and isn't making friends easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that's going to be a child would </v>

231
00:12:42.621 --> 00:12:45.080
<v Speaker 1>come home after that cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall apart,</v>

232
00:12:45.081 --> 00:12:46.940
<v Speaker 1>and maybe be angry and tell their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

233
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.670
<v Speaker 1>no one would play with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

234
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.780
<v Speaker 1>they'll break down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have tears.</v>

235
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost as if they switch from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain where they're competent.</v>

236
00:12:54.351 --> 00:12:59.351
<v Speaker 1>Like emotions signifies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially negative emotions signifies </v>

237
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:03.221
<v Speaker 1>that you've moved from the domain in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you're competent to the domain in </v>

238
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:04.700
<v Speaker 1>which you're not competent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're crying,</v>

239
00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.820
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's often a distress signal,</v>

240
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.880
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's often a distress signal and it </v>

241
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.911
<v Speaker 1>means I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ended up in a situation where what </v>

242
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I know is no longer sufficient to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce the outcomes that I desire.</v>

243
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.710
<v Speaker 1>So you cry and then you get help people </v>
<v Speaker 1>come and say,</v>

244
00:13:21.711 --> 00:13:23.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the matter?</v>

245
00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And they give you a little pat and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

246
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:29.570
<v Speaker 1>and they console you and then maybe they</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you strategize about what you could</v>

247
00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:34.571
<v Speaker 1>do to make the situation better or how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could act or if you're a smart </v>

248
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:38.291
<v Speaker 1>parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you play with your child and </v>

249
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:40.580
<v Speaker 1>offered them upgrade their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact socially.</v>

250
00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Or you can take them out on additional </v>
<v Speaker 1>play dates or whatever and monitor their</v>

251
00:13:43.791 --> 00:13:47.090
<v Speaker 1>behavior and help them reconstruct their</v>

252
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.550
<v Speaker 1>little subpersonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

253
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.610
<v Speaker 1>and bring in more information so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more sophisticated.</v>

254
00:13:53.611 --> 00:13:58.611
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be the phd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a combination of the PSW and </v>

255
00:13:58.611 --> 00:14:03.201
<v Speaker 1>ideas of this stage theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is movement upward with a </v>

256
00:14:03.201 --> 00:14:06.591
<v Speaker 1>punctuation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the confusion because the </v>

257
00:14:06.591 --> 00:14:07.740
<v Speaker 1>previous structure is no longer well </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapted to the world.</v>

258
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.500
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea of assimilation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accommodation,</v>

259
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.930
<v Speaker 1>psj kind of made assimilation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accommodation in a sense opposites and </v>

260
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not exact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to figure out,</v>

261
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but assimilation for piaget is when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull information in and the structure,</v>

262
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
<v Speaker 1>the internal structure that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling it into doesn't really have to </v>

263
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.061
<v Speaker 1>change that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And accommodation is when you pull in a </v>

264
00:14:32.061 --> 00:14:35.961
<v Speaker 1>fairly mighty piece of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often negative and it's so disruptive </v>

265
00:14:35.961 --> 00:14:40.101
<v Speaker 1>that the structure that you're using to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the information has to be </v>

266
00:14:40.101 --> 00:14:43.671
<v Speaker 1>reconstructed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now psj thinks of assimilation or </v>

267
00:14:43.671 --> 00:14:47.841
<v Speaker 1>accommodation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's much easier to think </v>

268
00:14:47.841 --> 00:14:50.481
<v Speaker 1>about it on a continuum with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assimilation occurring at the level of </v>

269
00:14:50.481 --> 00:14:51.310
<v Speaker 1>micro behaviors.</v>

270
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>

271
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to pick up a fork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:59.801
<v Speaker 1>maybe your hands when you try to pick up</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fork and it doesn't work a couple of </v>

273
00:14:59.801 --> 00:15:02.861
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you just change your grip and pick </v>

274
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:02.861
<v Speaker 1>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a little annoying.</v>

275
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 1>You're going to look at the fork and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try a couple of routines</v>

276
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:07.820
<v Speaker 1>to pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

277
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to bring your whole damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to a halt,</v>

278
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so whereas if you find a dead mouse in </v>

279
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.681
<v Speaker 1>your soup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's going to be a whole </v>

280
00:15:17.681 --> 00:15:17.681
<v Speaker 1>different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

281
00:15:17.681 --> 00:15:20.261
<v Speaker 1>it's a hierarchical issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at the bottom near the motor </v>

282
00:15:20.261 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's easy to assimilate.</v>

283
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.980
<v Speaker 1>You just have to make minor changes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

284
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I like to think about them as maps </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

285
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.460
<v Speaker 1>but their maps or personalities that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those don't sound the same,</v>

286
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:32.450
<v Speaker 1>but they're very similar.</v>

287
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Depends on whether the thing needs a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little adjustment or whether you have to</v>

288
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.550
<v Speaker 1>toss the whole thing away and build a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new one.</v>

289
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:45.551
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the difference between tightening </v>

290
00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:45.551
<v Speaker 1>the lug nuts on your car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying a new car.</v>

291
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:50.830
<v Speaker 1>You can see levels of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can understand it as levels of </v>

292
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.670
<v Speaker 1>difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another way of thinking about it,</v>

293
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:59.080
<v Speaker 1>you need to know this because you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand how it is that you figure </v>

294
00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.930
<v Speaker 1>out how upset you should get when </v>
<v Speaker 1>something goes wrong.</v>

295
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated question.</v>

296
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:05.240
<v Speaker 1>If you wake up with is an ache in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

297
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.240
<v Speaker 1>how upset should you be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

298
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe it's nothing.</v>

299
00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're going to die of cancer in </v>
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>

300
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:16.781
<v Speaker 1>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's not self evident how people </v>

301
00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:20.711
<v Speaker 1>calibrate their emotions when something </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes wrong because of the extent of the </v>

302
00:16:20.711 --> 00:16:22.510
<v Speaker 1>thing that went wrong is not clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>evident.</v>

303
00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Your partner's crabby when you out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner,</v>

304
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.110
<v Speaker 1>does that mean that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>break up in two weeks?</v>

305
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:32.230
<v Speaker 1>While it might mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why don't you just flip out right </v>

306
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.230
<v Speaker 1>away because the whole world's coming to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an end.</v>

307
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people do,</v>

308
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:39.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those would be people who were </v>

309
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.391
<v Speaker 1>higher in negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're hire and neuroticism because </v>

310
00:16:40.391 --> 00:16:42.200
<v Speaker 1>they're more likely to react as if a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>

311
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:47.380
<v Speaker 1>potentially small anomaly or uncertainty</v>
<v Speaker 1>or threat or discontinuity or unexpected</v>

312
00:16:47.841 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 1>occurrence is catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're an emotionally stable person.</v>

313
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might really have,</v>

314
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 1>you might have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm breaking up with you before.</v>

315
00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:57.590
<v Speaker 1>They're going to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look upset,</v>

316
00:16:57.591 --> 00:16:59.930
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even then it's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bother them that much.</v>

317
00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

318
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.850
<v Speaker 1>So you think of the motor hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

319
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.730
<v Speaker 1>ranging from micro behaviors at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom to abstractions at the top,</v>

320
00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:12.731
<v Speaker 1>and then you can understand how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might compute how upset you get when </v>

321
00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:12.731
<v Speaker 1>something goes wrong.</v>

322
00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Assume that it's small to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check at that level.</v>

323
00:17:16.581 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 1>If you can't fix it at that level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced one level up.</v>

324
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 1>If your car doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't buy a new one.</v>

325
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.790
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you do is maybe see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the battery is dead right?</v>

326
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:30.791
<v Speaker 1>Because that that's the path that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could take that would cause you the </v>

327
00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:34.421
<v Speaker 1>least amount of trouble and to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good schema for mental hygiene.</v>

328
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like Ockham's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>razor,</v>

329
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:37.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ockham's,</v>

330
00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:39.020
<v Speaker 1>razor and science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

331
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:44.021
<v Speaker 1>Does that make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does everybody know what Ockham's razor </v>

332
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:44.021
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people know how,</v>

333
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 1>what Ockham's razor is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

334
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:46.700
<v Speaker 1>How many people don't know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

335
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.420
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

336
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

337
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 1>you should know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really too bad that you don't know.</v>

338
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.290
<v Speaker 1>It's undoubtedly no reflection on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

339
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Arcoms razor is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the phrase referring to a what?</v>

340
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.720
<v Speaker 1>A principal that was established by an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient thinker,</v>

341
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Arcam and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not multiply your explanatory </v>

342
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 1>principles beyond necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

343
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:20.691
<v Speaker 1>and so what he meant was if you have six</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why something might have gone </v>

344
00:18:20.691 --> 00:18:23.190
<v Speaker 1>wrong and you can rank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>order them in terms of complexity,</v>

345
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:28.530
<v Speaker 1>pick the simplest one and then until you</v>
<v Speaker 1>disproved that,</v>

346
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:31.200
<v Speaker 1>stick with it and then go to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplest one and so on,</v>

347
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:36.201
<v Speaker 1>so and it's often used as a guiding </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle in science where the where the</v>

348
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:37.890
<v Speaker 1>idea is</v>

349
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.480
<v Speaker 1>if you have a simple explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't complicate it up with a bunch of </v>

350
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.631
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary assumptions and you also </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be reflective of a deeper </v>

351
00:18:49.181 --> 00:18:50.740
<v Speaker 1>underlying truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that</v>

352
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:58.730
<v Speaker 1>it's unlikely for any set of entities to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in any particular configuration,</v>

353
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:04.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's particularly unlikely for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an a not unlikely and complex </v>

354
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.910
<v Speaker 1>configuration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

355
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.990
<v Speaker 1>and so hopefully that's understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tangle all those ideas together </v>

356
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.160
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of your personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

357
00:19:14.161 --> 00:19:16.590
<v Speaker 1>There are actions at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are abstractions.</v>

358
00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Moral abstractions like be a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

359
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.020
<v Speaker 1>When you run into something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected,</v>

360
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:27.320
<v Speaker 1>the amount you get upset is </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportionate to the level in the </v>

361
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:27.750
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy where the damage appears to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking place.</v>

362
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Now you kind of have to guess it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that partner,</v>

363
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.750
<v Speaker 1>you do that with your temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're high in neuroticism,</v>

364
00:19:33.751 --> 00:19:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you guessed catastrophe and if it's low </v>
<v Speaker 1>in neuroticism,</v>

365
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:41.061
<v Speaker 1>you guess irrelevant and you do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because of the way that you </v>

366
00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 1>perceive your own competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

367
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:46.830
<v Speaker 1>because if you've encountered minor to </v>
<v Speaker 1>major problems in the past,</v>

368
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.280
<v Speaker 1>say even if you're a nervous person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've solved them,</v>

369
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.600
<v Speaker 1>you might've learned while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

370
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:56.601
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can fix problems so it's not </v>

371
00:19:56.601 --> 00:19:56.601
<v Speaker 1>really a problem.</v>

372
00:19:56.601 --> 00:19:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Which is a really good way to think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

373
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a better way,</v>

374
00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.340
<v Speaker 1>a much better way to think of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm a person with no problems.</v>

375
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that,</v>

376
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:08.870
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a person who could successfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>address problems if I concentrated on </v>

377
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.870
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very,</v>

378
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:13.260
<v Speaker 1>very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other way that your nervous</v>

379
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:18.261
<v Speaker 1>system sort of decides how upset you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should get when something happens is by </v>

380
00:20:18.261 --> 00:20:22.101
<v Speaker 1>looking at how other people treat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they treat you like you're </v>

381
00:20:22.101 --> 00:20:25.581
<v Speaker 1>competent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your nervous system gets less </v>

382
00:20:25.581 --> 00:20:25.581
<v Speaker 1>neurotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that's a good way of thinking about</v>

383
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.890
<v Speaker 1>you produce more Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you react less globally to indications </v>

384
00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:32.880
<v Speaker 1>of error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

385
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.890
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so piaget,</v>

386
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:40.130
<v Speaker 1>he talks about assimilation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assimilation is when you have to make a </v>

387
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.891
<v Speaker 1>little change in accommodation is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole damn structure has to be </v>

388
00:20:42.891 --> 00:20:42.900
<v Speaker 1>reconfigured.</v>

389
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.200
<v Speaker 1>And he thought about those in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>as separate types of learning,</v>

390
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.700
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're on a,</v>

391
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 1>they're on a continuum from very simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>to very complex.</v>

392
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Have any of you ever heard of the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a paradigm shift?</v>

393
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.230
<v Speaker 1>How many people have heard of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

394
00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:01.870
<v Speaker 1>How many people haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

395
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 1>do you know the name Thomas Kuhn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody?</v>

396
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.270
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

397
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:12.271
<v Speaker 1>Well Thomas Kuhn was a philosopher of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and he wrote a book in 1962 </v>

398
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:12.320
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

399
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 1>scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it's called?</v>

400
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.530
<v Speaker 1>The nature of scientific revolutions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

401
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:22.680
<v Speaker 1>And coon basically said the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the way knowledge structures </v>

402
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 1>proceeded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Piaget said,</v>

403
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:28.570
<v Speaker 1>about that progression of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures within the individual.</v>

404
00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:33.571
<v Speaker 1>So going with concerned about large </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale transformations in scientific </v>

405
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:36.280
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example.</v>

406
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.880
<v Speaker 1>So in the late eighties and nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicists were convinced that they're </v>

407
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Speaker 1>just going to have to shut the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavor down.</v>

408
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

409
00:21:46.001 --> 00:21:51.001
<v Speaker 1>because the physicists knew everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was to know there wasn't a single </v>

410
00:21:51.001 --> 00:21:54.541
<v Speaker 1>phenomena at that point that physicists </v>
<v Speaker 1>could not account for it except one.</v>

411
00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.020
<v Speaker 1>And here's the one that they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>account for it.</v>

412
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.340
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're on a train and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going that way at half the speed of </v>

413
00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:10.591
<v Speaker 1>light and you shine a flashlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're standing on the top of the trade,</v>

414
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.890
<v Speaker 1>obviously protecting yourself against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wind.</v>

415
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And you shine a light going ahead and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you measure the speed of light out of </v>

416
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.410
<v Speaker 1>your flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The speed of light is 186,000</v>

417
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 1>miles per second out of your flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

418
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.900
<v Speaker 1>So now you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the ground and you're watching</v>

419
00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:33.901
<v Speaker 1>this train zip by and the guys on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shining a flashlight and light comes </v>

420
00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:36.880
<v Speaker 1>out of the front of his flashlight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you measured the speed of it.</v>

421
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.410
<v Speaker 1>What's the speed?</v>

422
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.810
<v Speaker 1>While you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously it's the speed of light </v>

423
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.211
<v Speaker 1>plus half the speed of light because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>train is going half the speed of light </v>

424
00:22:48.211 --> 00:22:48.211
<v Speaker 1>and the light is going the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

425
00:22:48.211 --> 00:22:52.981
<v Speaker 1>and so the light coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of the train and the light </v>

426
00:22:52.981 --> 00:22:54.940
<v Speaker 1>is this is the speed of light plus half </v>
<v Speaker 1>the speed of light.</v>

427
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.520
<v Speaker 1>That's what would happen if someone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing the ball right,</v>

428
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:03.620
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is it's the speed of light </v>

429
00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.120
<v Speaker 1>and no matter how fast you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you shine your flashlight out,</v>

430
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the light coming out of your flashlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be going exactly 186,000</v>

431
00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:10.870
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute second,</v>

432
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.980
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred 80,</v>

433
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:13.150
<v Speaker 1>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles a second.</v>

434
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not additive and so if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're on the train and you're </v>

435
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.230
<v Speaker 1>backwards and you're shining your light </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the person meshes,</v>

436
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not the speed of light minus half </v>
<v Speaker 1>the speed of light,</v>

437
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.420
<v Speaker 1>which is what it would be if you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing the ball.</v>

438
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It's speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

439
00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:31.060
<v Speaker 1>nobody knew how the hell to account for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

440
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:33.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like that just made no sense at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

441
00:23:33.251 --> 00:23:35.140
<v Speaker 1>but everyone was ignoring it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

442
00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:40.141
<v Speaker 1>it turns out you can ignore that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the only thing that wasn't </v>

443
00:23:40.241 --> 00:23:45.241
<v Speaker 1>quite well laid out at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19th century from the perspective of </v>

444
00:23:45.241 --> 00:23:45.740
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a big one,</v>

445
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.980
<v Speaker 1>and to solve that Newtonian physics had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be completely overthrown and quantum </v>

446
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:55.220
<v Speaker 1>physics put in its place and quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics is quantum physics.</v>

447
00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.520
<v Speaker 1>You might think of it as a box like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inside that there's a box that says </v>

448
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.301
<v Speaker 1>Newtonian physics and quantum physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>can explain everything that Newtonian </v>

449
00:24:04.301 --> 00:24:07.580
<v Speaker 1>physics can explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it explains some more things besides</v>

450
00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:09.830
<v Speaker 1>and so you would say because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a better theory.</v>

451
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Now I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

452
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.270
<v Speaker 1>you just made a personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

453
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Are you better person than you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>

454
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.900
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

455
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:19.670
<v Speaker 1>how in the world can you make a judgment</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>

456
00:24:19.671 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

457
00:24:20.451 --> 00:24:23.900
<v Speaker 1>if you're a better personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do all the things you could do</v>

458
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:26.630
<v Speaker 1>before just as well or maybe even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little better.</v>

459
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Plus there's a bunch of new things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do that's a better personality.</v>

460
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.400
<v Speaker 1>So another interesting example of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of better,</v>

461
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.440
<v Speaker 1>which really is a moral idea in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

462
00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:39.230
<v Speaker 1>better versus worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can conceptualize it,</v>

463
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.030
<v Speaker 1>but this is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget is really,</v>

464
00:24:41.031 --> 00:24:46.031
<v Speaker 1>really useful because it gives you a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a language that's grounded in </v>

465
00:24:46.031 --> 00:24:49.670
<v Speaker 1>observation and in science to start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle questions that start to border on</v>

466
00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:52.160
<v Speaker 1>the moral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a better personality can do more than</v>

467
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.460
<v Speaker 1>the previous personality could and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can certainly see how that would be </v>

468
00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:57.460
<v Speaker 1>applicable to your life.</v>

469
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I would suggest as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of that is,</v>

470
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always compare themselves to </v>

471
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.250
<v Speaker 1>other people and generally what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is you compare yourself.</v>

472
00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:12.251
<v Speaker 1>You make a little dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the people that are right around </v>

473
00:25:12.251 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 1>you and this is a very annoying </v>
<v Speaker 1>propensity because what it means is that</v>

474
00:25:14.061 --> 00:25:16.160
<v Speaker 1>no matter how successful you get in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

475
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you're still going to be in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dominance hierarchy.</v>

476
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.140
<v Speaker 1>So you'll end up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

477
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe you end up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

478
00:25:22.461 --> 00:25:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're CEO of a $100,000,000</v>

479
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:26.150
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say,</v>

480
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get to go hang out with a bunch of </v>

481
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.720
<v Speaker 1>ceos and like there's 10 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three of them are ceos of a $2,000,000</v>

482
00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:37.721
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a pretty little CEO </v>

483
00:25:37.721 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 1>among those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who are you going to be comparing </v>

484
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 1>yourself to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys who pick up your trash?</v>

485
00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

486
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.960
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you won't.</v>

487
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.230
<v Speaker 1>You'll have your little group around you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll be somewhere in the middle,</v>

488
00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:50.231
<v Speaker 1>and so that's useful to know because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that what you have to learn </v>

489
00:25:50.231 --> 00:25:55.211
<v Speaker 1>to cope with is the fact that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be somewhere in the middle and </v>

490
00:25:55.211 --> 00:25:55.211
<v Speaker 1>then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

491
00:25:55.211 --> 00:25:59.381
<v Speaker 1>how do you cope with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you should be improving and you </v>

492
00:25:59.381 --> 00:25:59.381
<v Speaker 1>also want to be very good at something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

493
00:25:59.381 --> 00:26:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I think the best way to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is especially true when you're </v>

494
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.931
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you don't compare yourself to </v>

495
00:26:07.931 --> 00:26:09.581
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You compare yourself to the previous </v>

496
00:26:09.581 --> 00:26:09.800
<v Speaker 1>version of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good control,</v>

497
00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:11.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you'll see,</v>

498
00:26:11.421 --> 00:26:14.660
<v Speaker 1>especially by the time you were about 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're young,</v>

499
00:26:14.661 --> 00:26:19.661
<v Speaker 1>you have to compare yourself to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because because when you're </v>

500
00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:21.650
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a lot like all other young people</v>

501
00:26:21.651 --> 00:26:26.651
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the time you're 30 year old or </v>

502
00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:26.651
<v Speaker 1>you're not very much like other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

503
00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:30.790
<v Speaker 1>and so you know because the conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your life start to become so unique </v>

504
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:34.421
<v Speaker 1>and specific to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then comparing yourself to other </v>

505
00:26:34.421 --> 00:26:37.811
<v Speaker 1>people isn't very helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but comparing yourself to who you were </v>

506
00:26:37.811 --> 00:26:40.481
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really helpful and you can keep </v>

507
00:26:40.481 --> 00:26:40.481
<v Speaker 1>doing that your whole life and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair game.</v>

508
00:26:40.481 --> 00:26:45.191
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the previous you had all the </v>

509
00:26:45.191 --> 00:26:45.191
<v Speaker 1>problems and all the</v>

510
00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 1>like opportunities and and positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes that you have.</v>

511
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.330
<v Speaker 1>It's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fair game and it'll.</v>

512
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.770
<v Speaker 1>It'll save you an awful lot of misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so alright,</v>

513
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:00.370
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

514
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.900
<v Speaker 1>the outline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different forms of games and he talked </v>

515
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.691
<v Speaker 1>about different ways that those aided in</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialization and you can understand </v>

516
00:27:13.691 --> 00:27:16.931
<v Speaker 1>that I used this Meta idea which was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of personality to sort of </v>

517
00:27:17.511 --> 00:27:20.300
<v Speaker 1>explain that from a Piagetian </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

518
00:27:20.301 --> 00:27:25.301
<v Speaker 1>You put yourself together from your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>upward towards increased abstractions </v>

519
00:27:25.301 --> 00:27:28.310
<v Speaker 1>and as you do that you can do more </v>
<v Speaker 1>things with your body,</v>

520
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.460
<v Speaker 1>but you can also do more complex things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Integrating those things that you do </v>

521
00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.350
<v Speaker 1>with your body across time and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing numbers of other people.</v>

522
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Now he actually has this really cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea about what constitutes morality as </v>

523
00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:44.480
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he would say,</v>

524
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:45.920
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say</v>

525
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.880
<v Speaker 1>you can choose gay or you can choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>game be and you might say,</v>

526
00:27:49.881 --> 00:27:54.881
<v Speaker 1>well I want to figure out whether they </v>
<v Speaker 1>may or gave me is a better game because </v>

527
00:27:54.881 --> 00:27:55.910
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to play a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might as well be a better game.</v>

528
00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.470
<v Speaker 1>And so he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

529
00:27:57.471 --> 00:28:01.340
<v Speaker 1>so here's how you can figure out if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game you're playing is a good one.</v>

530
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you now,</v>

531
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.540
<v Speaker 1>it's good for you now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next week,</v>

532
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.130
<v Speaker 1>next month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next year,</v>

533
00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:13.580
<v Speaker 1>and 10 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't always a good for you now,</v>

534
00:28:13.581 --> 00:28:16.520
<v Speaker 1>but if you play it repeatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things get better for you.</v>

535
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

536
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a game where you're taking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future into account.</v>

537
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not an impulsive game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

538
00:28:22.341 --> 00:28:27.200
<v Speaker 1>like if you wanna if cocaine is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good for people for about a day,</v>

539
00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.230
<v Speaker 1>but over a week or six months or five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

540
00:28:30.231 --> 00:28:31.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a degenerating game.</v>

541
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't use your emotion to </v>

542
00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.401
<v Speaker 1>determine that because cocaine generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffuses the person who's using it with </v>

543
00:28:39.401 --> 00:28:43.961
<v Speaker 1>a sense of power and possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't just rely on your emotion </v>

544
00:28:43.961 --> 00:28:48.050
<v Speaker 1>no more than you can when you're tempted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do something impulsive and fun,</v>

545
00:28:48.051 --> 00:28:49.880
<v Speaker 1>but that might have negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

546
00:28:49.881 --> 00:28:54.881
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the game should be good now and </v>

547
00:28:54.881 --> 00:28:57.491
<v Speaker 1>across the future and then it should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you and it should be good for </v>

548
00:28:57.491 --> 00:29:02.171
<v Speaker 1>your family and it should be good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your social community and so forth as </v>

549
00:29:02.171 --> 00:29:06.251
<v Speaker 1>you spiral out word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it should be good for all of those </v>

550
00:29:06.251 --> 00:29:08.621
<v Speaker 1>things across multiple expanses of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and PSJ would call that an e rated game.</v>

551
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Now there's another additional idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the idea of inequality rated </v>

552
00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:20.381
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that if I'm playing a game </v>

553
00:29:20.381 --> 00:29:24.251
<v Speaker 1>that's good for me and it's good for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's good for you and it's good for </v>

554
00:29:24.251 --> 00:29:27.251
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we probably will all be willing to </v>

555
00:29:27.251 --> 00:29:30.011
<v Speaker 1>play it voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also why piaget believed </v>

556
00:29:30.011 --> 00:29:32.450
<v Speaker 1>that in some sense a game like </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

557
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.480
<v Speaker 1>let's say a social structure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody plays because they want to is </v>

558
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:41.531
<v Speaker 1>much better than a game like structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everyone plays because they have </v>

559
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:41.531
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he would say,</v>

560
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:45.791
<v Speaker 1>well that's in part the technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between a tyranny and a </v>

561
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody smart thinking.</v>

562
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:53.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Piaget got further with that </v>

563
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.141
<v Speaker 1>idea than anyone else had ever in </v>
<v Speaker 1>history because you can understand </v>

564
00:29:55.141 --> 00:29:55.930
<v Speaker 1>there's this old idea.</v>

565
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Bob was hume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another philosopher.</v>

566
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.980
<v Speaker 1>What's his first name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

567
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 1>David?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

568
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:08.050
<v Speaker 1>he took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember that.</v>

569
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:13.230
<v Speaker 1>David Hume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has this idea that you can derive </v>

570
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.570
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

571
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's another one of those principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Arkansas Razor,</v>

572
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.850
<v Speaker 1>and what it means is something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

573
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much you know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

574
00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:24.100
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that you can figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what you should do about it.</v>

575
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.260
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say we know AIDS is a problem.</v>

576
00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:32.470
<v Speaker 1>We know cancer is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know heart disease is a problem,</v>

577
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:36.310
<v Speaker 1>we know poverty's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

578
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.520
<v Speaker 1>There's all these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you deTermine how you would </v>

579
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.490
<v Speaker 1>allocate resources to those different </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems?</v>

580
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

581
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:46.780
<v Speaker 1>very difficult problem to get out from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective.</v>

582
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

583
00:30:48.941 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Speaker 1>there's all these variables that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to equate.</v>

584
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you built a spreadsheet and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were thinking,</v>

585
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:55.740
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the most trouble,</v>

586
00:30:55.741 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 1>some of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

587
00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.710
<v Speaker 1>which could we solve with the least </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money?</v>

588
00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:05.130
<v Speaker 1>While the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that to to determine whether </v>

589
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.570
<v Speaker 1>something is troublesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still have to make a value judgment.</v>

590
00:31:07.571 --> 00:31:12.571
<v Speaker 1>Like tHere's no way you can get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the problem without </v>

591
00:31:12.571 --> 00:31:12.970
<v Speaker 1>introducing the problem of value </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment.</v>

592
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to derive an ot.</v>

593
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 1>What you should do from an is what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

594
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.020
<v Speaker 1>and that's why there's a distinction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between science and morality are science</v>

595
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:28.021
<v Speaker 1>and religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it </v>

596
00:31:28.021 --> 00:31:28.021
<v Speaker 1>is that they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're different domains.</v>

597
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget in some sense has described a way</v>

598
00:31:32.201 --> 00:31:35.050
<v Speaker 1>out of that because he does say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

599
00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:37.090
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a theory that's better than the previous</v>

600
00:31:37.091 --> 00:31:42.091
<v Speaker 1>theory is the theory that explains the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same amount plus more and you can apply </v>

601
00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:45.751
<v Speaker 1>that to your personality and then a game</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's better than a different game is </v>

602
00:31:45.751 --> 00:31:48.220
<v Speaker 1>one that benefits you and more people.</v>

603
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.530
<v Speaker 1>But it also does that over different </v>
<v Speaker 1>spans of time.</v>

604
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>game like that's very hard to compute.</v>

605
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:58.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people talk about environmental </v>

606
00:31:58.291 --> 00:32:00.211
<v Speaker 1>sustainability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're really talking about is a </v>

607
00:32:00.211 --> 00:32:03.331
<v Speaker 1>pig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eddie and equivalent of calibrated game </v>

608
00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:05.850
<v Speaker 1>where you can live in your family and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family can live in society and </v>

609
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.961
<v Speaker 1>society can operate within an economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the economy can exist within the </v>

610
00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:14.070
<v Speaker 1>oncology without having it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy tilt the ecology so that you </v>

611
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.210
<v Speaker 1>can't live and your family can't live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your society,</v>

612
00:32:16.211 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 1>can function on the act and the economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>system can't function.</v>

613
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.560
<v Speaker 1>So there is this idea of multilevel </v>
<v Speaker 1>ballots,</v>

614
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 1>but those things are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to compute.</v>

615
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

616
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's still a nice principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

617
00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:30.730
<v Speaker 1>so if you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

618
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:36.420
<v Speaker 1>if you need a justification for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and you want to put </v>

619
00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.451
<v Speaker 1>yourself on from moral ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really useful because then </v>

620
00:32:39.451 --> 00:32:42.721
<v Speaker 1>people can't push you around verbally or</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually or any other way because </v>

621
00:32:42.721 --> 00:32:42.721
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

622
00:32:42.721 --> 00:32:44.990
<v Speaker 1>you're grounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're standing on something solid.</v>

623
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:49.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like you need to know why is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you as if you were someone you </v>

624
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.561
<v Speaker 1>were taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it good for you across a long </v>

625
00:32:53.561 --> 00:32:53.690
<v Speaker 1>period of time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>HoW does it benefit your family,</v>

626
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.330
<v Speaker 1>how does it benefit society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

627
00:32:56.331 --> 00:33:01.331
<v Speaker 1>you can keep stepping upward from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could give you one example of </v>

628
00:33:01.331 --> 00:33:03.530
<v Speaker 1>someone who's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know about that.</v>

629
00:33:03.531 --> 00:33:07.070
<v Speaker 1>That's kin who figured out how to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic out of the oceans.</v>

630
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 1>He's not just whining about it and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>like parading around with a sign that </v>

631
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

632
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.111
<v Speaker 1>I don't like pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like as if you need to tell people </v>

633
00:33:17.111 --> 00:33:17.111
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

634
00:33:17.111 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 1>because everyone really doesn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like pollution and I'm against </v>

635
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

636
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:25.361
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well find someone who's for pollution </v>

637
00:33:25.361 --> 00:33:25.610
<v Speaker 1>and poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

638
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.780
<v Speaker 1>this kid was about 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

639
00:33:28.781 --> 00:33:29.900
<v Speaker 1>and he was diving around.</v>

640
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:35.080
<v Speaker 1>He's a diver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was spear fishing and he </v>

641
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.411
<v Speaker 1>noticed there was more plastic than fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this wasn't a very happy discovery </v>

642
00:33:38.411 --> 00:33:42.671
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so I started thinking about </v>

643
00:33:42.671 --> 00:33:45.581
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can we get the plastic out of the </v>

644
00:33:45.581 --> 00:33:47.081
<v Speaker 1>oceans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he was looking at manta rays </v>

645
00:33:47.081 --> 00:33:49.601
<v Speaker 1>and manta rays have these big wings that</v>
<v Speaker 1>help them sort of glide through the </v>

646
00:33:49.601 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thought about that for awhile and</v>

647
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:54.611
<v Speaker 1>then he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I could build this sort of </v>

648
00:33:54.611 --> 00:33:55.490
<v Speaker 1>ray thing that lies on the surface of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean in a triangle,</v>

649
00:33:55.730 --> 00:34:00.730
<v Speaker 1>and then it could be towed through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean and all the plastic would go to </v>

650
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.770
<v Speaker 1>the apex of the triangle and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can just scoop it up.</v>

651
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.400
<v Speaker 1>But then he did his calculations and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't got this story quite right,</v>

652
00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:10.400
<v Speaker 1>but this is basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is basically the story.</v>

653
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:16.690
<v Speaker 1>He did some calculations and found out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not cost effective because </v>

654
00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:20.081
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of energy to drag this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing through the water and there's a </v>

655
00:34:20.081 --> 00:34:21.650
<v Speaker 1>lot of water and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and plus you're polluting like mad while</v>

656
00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:23.000
<v Speaker 1>you're dragging this thing through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

657
00:34:23.001 --> 00:34:24.980
<v Speaker 1>And so probably it's just not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful.</v>

658
00:34:24.981 --> 00:34:27.050
<v Speaker 1>But then he realized that if you go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ocean,</v>

659
00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.890
<v Speaker 1>there are these massive things called </v>
<v Speaker 1>gyres which are like,</v>

660
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.670
<v Speaker 1>they're like huge water hurricanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except they're very,</v>

661
00:34:34.671 --> 00:34:35.900
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very slow moving.</v>

662
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.090
<v Speaker 1>But they're huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're continent size.</v>

663
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:40.700
<v Speaker 1>And so the oceans are already moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always moving.</v>

664
00:34:40.701 --> 00:34:43.460
<v Speaker 1>So he thought hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the ocean is moving,</v>

665
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:45.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no real reason to have to drag </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

666
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

667
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.420
<v Speaker 1>the plastic or the plastic gatherer </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the water.</v>

668
00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:54.450
<v Speaker 1>You could just nail it to the ocean bed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with cables and then just have it sit </v>

669
00:34:54.651 --> 00:34:57.140
<v Speaker 1>there and then the ocean would go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it all by itself.</v>

670
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:02.530
<v Speaker 1>So he built A prototype which wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>very big and he gathered up a fair bit </v>

671
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:03.010
<v Speaker 1>of plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the plastics and the boat,</v>

672
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:08.020
<v Speaker 1>the foot of the ocean by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really increases in density as </v>

673
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.281
<v Speaker 1>you move up towards the top bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he built a bigger one and then </v>

674
00:35:12.281 --> 00:35:16.180
<v Speaker 1>he got a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went on kickstarter and then he </v>

675
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:16.880
<v Speaker 1>raised a bunch of money and then he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of engineers to look at his idea</v>

676
00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 1>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

677
00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:19.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this probably work.</v>

678
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So then they built a big one a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers long,</v>

679
00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:25.220
<v Speaker 1>which is now in place off the shore of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

680
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:30.370
<v Speaker 1>They also sent a whole flotilla of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from California to who I do a </v>

681
00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.690
<v Speaker 1>garbage estimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how much garbage,</v>

682
00:35:32.691 --> 00:35:34.580
<v Speaker 1>the risk of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a big spot in the middle</v>

683
00:35:34.581 --> 00:35:37.070
<v Speaker 1>of the pacific called the great garbage </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot,</v>

684
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.470
<v Speaker 1>which is full of great plastic spot.</v>

685
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full of plastic.</v>

686
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.560
<v Speaker 1>So they went to estimate how much there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was it in anyways.</v>

687
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:49.580
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he can guide this thing to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the ocean and these big jars </v>

688
00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.280
<v Speaker 1>make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

689
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.940
<v Speaker 1>100 kilometers long in a v shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a kind of a collector at the end of </v>

690
00:35:57.121 --> 00:36:02.121
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>load all the plastic he collects up on </v>

691
00:36:02.121 --> 00:36:04.611
<v Speaker 1>barges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go refine that into oil or plastic and </v>

692
00:36:04.611 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 1>pay for it while he's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can look them up.</v>

693
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think he's like 19 or 20 now.</v>

694
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.350
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

695
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.450
<v Speaker 1>that's a good equilibrated game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

696
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 1>That works out really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets to make some money.</v>

697
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets to employ a bunch of people.</v>

698
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:23.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's happy about it because it's </v>

699
00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:23.180
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

700
00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.900
<v Speaker 1>we're getting rid of the garbage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no downside,</v>

701
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:30.020
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to come up with an argument </v>

702
00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 1>for why that isn't a good thing and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

703
00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:35.760
<v Speaker 1>It's good because everyone benefits all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way up.</v>

704
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's an equilibrated integrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

705
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

706
00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:41.610
<v Speaker 1>very smart idea.</v>

707
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

708
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:48.700
<v Speaker 3>young</v>

709
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.900
<v Speaker 1>experimental psychologists don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

710
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like freud either and they </v>

711
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.240
<v Speaker 1>don't have much time for clinicians in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

712
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:06.590
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not trying to solve the same </v>

713
00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:10.161
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now usually if you take a personality </v>

714
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:15.321
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll cover freud before you cover </v>

715
00:37:15.321 --> 00:37:18.261
<v Speaker 1>young and the reason for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>freud in some ways preceded young </v>

716
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:23.990
<v Speaker 1>historically and lots of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the freudians like to think </v>

717
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:27.810
<v Speaker 1>of young as freud's student and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some truth to that because freud was the</v>

718
00:37:27.811 --> 00:37:32.811
<v Speaker 1>first person who really collected up </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about the unconscious and </v>

719
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.520
<v Speaker 1>formalize them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicize them,</v>

720
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:39.720
<v Speaker 1>and applied them to the problems of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology and mental health.</v>

721
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:45.770
<v Speaker 1>So good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And freud was unparalleled at describing</v>

722
00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:49.020
<v Speaker 1>pathological families and there's plenty</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those,</v>

723
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.340
<v Speaker 1>but young was interested in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was underneath that.</v>

724
00:37:55.341 --> 00:37:57.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean freud got underneath things a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>

725
00:37:57.051 --> 00:38:02.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was also one of the first people to </v>

726
00:38:02.051 --> 00:38:04.001
<v Speaker 1>point out just exactly how potent sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>and aggressive motives were in shaping </v>

727
00:38:04.821 --> 00:38:05.960
<v Speaker 1>the way that we thought,</v>

728
00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:09.530
<v Speaker 3>but young</v>

729
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.540
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] was more interested in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

730
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.790
<v Speaker 1>young was more like a darwinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>biologist.</v>

731
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:22.090
<v Speaker 1>He was much more interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and psychological,</v>

732
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:28.810
<v Speaker 1>philosophical history of fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>human behavioral patterns and so young </v>

733
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:35.030
<v Speaker 1>wasn't like a behaviorist can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behaviorist would think when you're </v>

734
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:39.431
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing there except the </v>

735
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:41.020
<v Speaker 1>possibility to learn things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a blank slate and then everything</v>

736
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:46.021
<v Speaker 1>you learned as a consequence of sensory </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that you're picking up and </v>

737
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 1>what you learn as a consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But young,</v>

738
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.740
<v Speaker 1>he didn't think that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought that there's a specific human</v>

739
00:38:53.741 --> 00:38:58.741
<v Speaker 1>nature and he set out to understand what</v>
<v Speaker 1>that human nature is.</v>

740
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of lectures ago,</v>

741
00:39:02.021 --> 00:39:07.021
<v Speaker 1>I talked to you about the characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you might imagine making up the </v>

742
00:39:07.751 --> 00:39:09.790
<v Speaker 1>world that you inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

743
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:14.791
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about the absolute </v>

744
00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:14.791
<v Speaker 1>unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the unknown,</v>

745
00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:16.360
<v Speaker 1>that so unknown that you don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's there.</v>

746
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:22.200
<v Speaker 1>That's something that is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really shocking if you ever encounter </v>

747
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.441
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the sort of thing that you're </v>

748
00:39:25.441 --> 00:39:27.151
<v Speaker 1>exposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically whenever you go to a </v>

749
00:39:27.151 --> 00:39:27.550
<v Speaker 1>horror movie that depends on fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

750
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Because horror movies that depending on </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>

751
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:36.120
<v Speaker 1>confront you with things that do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave the way they're supposed to </v>

752
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:36.700
<v Speaker 1>behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like inanimate objects that move.</v>

753
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all of a sudden you discover an </v>

754
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.621
<v Speaker 1>inanimate object that moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot that's wrong with your </v>

755
00:39:43.621 --> 00:39:45.940
<v Speaker 1>particular model of the world and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can kind of experienced that in a horror</v>

756
00:39:45.941 --> 00:39:48.130
<v Speaker 1>movie because things will do things </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not supposed to do,</v>

757
00:39:48.131 --> 00:39:51.160
<v Speaker 1>like walls will bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not supposed to happen.</v>

758
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.590
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very upsetting to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

759
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:56.710
<v Speaker 1>But you're exposing yourself to that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror movies and trying to.</v>

760
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:03.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to develop some courage </v>

761
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:04.510
<v Speaker 1>because god only knows which of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental major assumptions.</v>

762
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Mit might just turn it off</v>

763
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.150
<v Speaker 3>to be wrong.</v>

764
00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 1>So we talked about representations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute unknown and I suggested </v>

765
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.680
<v Speaker 1>that those are often associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>serpentine predators.</v>

766
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 1>And then we talked about representations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of culture because like every character </v>

767
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:28.990
<v Speaker 1>has to contend with culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a fictional character or </v>

768
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:28.990
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck with it,</v>

769
00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.840
<v Speaker 1>you've got your culture and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's positive because here you are,</v>

770
00:40:32.841 --> 00:40:34.220
<v Speaker 1>you can talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read,</v>

771
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.750
<v Speaker 1>it's warm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

772
00:40:35.751 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Speaker 1>you've got a bright future ahead of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's also,</v>

773
00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:43.381
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also a destructive tyrant because </v>

774
00:40:43.381 --> 00:40:44.030
<v Speaker 1>it's ruining the world and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you already knew about.</v>

775
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's culture.</v>

776
00:40:45.561 --> 00:40:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And then there's nature because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck with that too.</v>

777
00:40:48.051 --> 00:40:53.051
<v Speaker 1>And there's a benevolent element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature that's usually portrayed with </v>

778
00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:57.581
<v Speaker 1>feminine symbols and that's the mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature that environmentalist know and </v>

779
00:40:57.581 --> 00:40:57.581
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

780
00:40:57.581 --> 00:41:02.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother nature that gives your mother </v>

781
00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:02.310
<v Speaker 1>pants or when she's 40.</v>

782
00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:06.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's the downside of mother nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're pretty much stuck with that </v>

783
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:10.691
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's you and there's all the </v>

784
00:41:10.691 --> 00:41:10.691
<v Speaker 1>useful things about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of heroic things.</v>

785
00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Technically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the parts of you that would be </v>

786
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.340
<v Speaker 1>able to confront the unknown and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevail or to confront the tyrannical </v>

787
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.620
<v Speaker 1>part of the culture and prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the positive part,</v>

788
00:41:21.621 --> 00:41:24.770
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the negative part which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the part of you that you know very,</v>

789
00:41:24.771 --> 00:41:29.771
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always causing trouble for you </v>

790
00:41:29.771 --> 00:41:31.811
<v Speaker 1>and other people and it doesn't do what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to and is resentful and </v>

791
00:41:31.811 --> 00:41:32.720
<v Speaker 1>angry and petty and mean and ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blind,</v>

792
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:37.770
<v Speaker 1>and I'm impulsive and rationalizing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these lovely things that people </v>

793
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:40.310
<v Speaker 1>are more than capable of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

794
00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:45.311
<v Speaker 1>Those are all archetypes and so there </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't good types because there are </v>

795
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:50.981
<v Speaker 1>fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the fundamental personalities </v>

796
00:41:50.981 --> 00:41:51.290
<v Speaker 1>that we use to orient ourselves in life.</v>

797
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's the best way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

798
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Now what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talked about an archetype,</v>

799
00:41:55.851 --> 00:42:00.851
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of complicated because </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes he talks about them as the </v>

800
00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:03.210
<v Speaker 1>instincts and sometimes he talks about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and his images and sometimes he </v>

801
00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.570
<v Speaker 1>talks about them as stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the best way to contend with that is</v>

802
00:42:05.571 --> 00:42:07.970
<v Speaker 1>to understand that there are all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those at the same time.</v>

803
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.460
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a romance,</v>

804
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 1>which is a kind of architectural story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to a romantic comedy,</v>

805
00:42:13.911 --> 00:42:18.650
<v Speaker 1>say that means you know the protagonists</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a love affair,</v>

806
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:23.390
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out positively romantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy and architectural structure.</v>

807
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other the characters do it while </v>

808
00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:28.690
<v Speaker 1>they're driven by instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

809
00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:30.440
<v Speaker 1>so that's the instinctive level of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype,</v>

810
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:35.650
<v Speaker 1>and then it's a behavioral pattern </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're interacting with each </v>

811
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:39.191
<v Speaker 1>other and it's a story because someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>has selected out the major elements of </v>

812
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.800
<v Speaker 1>the events in the way that would be most</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging to an audience and portrayed </v>

813
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:44.870
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

814
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.750
<v Speaker 1>So the archetype can be all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things at the same time,</v>

815
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes it a more complex </v>

816
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:52.960
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's best,</v>

817
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.671
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think of it as a personality and </v>

818
00:42:57.671 --> 00:42:59.771
<v Speaker 1>archetype is a personality and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural story is the manner in </v>

819
00:42:59.771 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Speaker 1>which an archetypal personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself across time.</v>

820
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:07.540
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of archetypal stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can give you a couple of </v>

821
00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:11.440
<v Speaker 1>fundamental examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental archetype of male </v>

822
00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.071
<v Speaker 1>behavior is the dragon story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronting the dragon and that's to go </v>

823
00:43:15.071 --> 00:43:19.541
<v Speaker 1>out confront the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can be all sorts of things that </v>

824
00:43:19.541 --> 00:43:23.021
<v Speaker 1>can be the absolute unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be the negative element of </v>

825
00:43:23.021 --> 00:43:26.231
<v Speaker 1>femininity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a dragon that stops man and </v>

826
00:43:26.231 --> 00:43:26.231
<v Speaker 1>cold all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

827
00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:32.740
<v Speaker 1>and usually what happens as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence is that the person gets a </v>

828
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 1>treasurer or gets a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

829
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.650
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental female archetype as far </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've been able to tell,</v>

830
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:37.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a little harder to track down.</v>

831
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:40.160
<v Speaker 1>It took me a long time is beauty and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beast.</v>

832
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.910
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I figured that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of reasons,</v>

833
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.250
<v Speaker 1>but only figured it out about two years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

834
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:46.910
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

835
00:43:46.911 --> 00:43:47.810
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

836
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.960
<v Speaker 1>I read this book by the guys who guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>who do data analysis at google and it's </v>

837
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:56.690
<v Speaker 1>called a billion wicked thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite an interesting book.</v>

838
00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:01.130
<v Speaker 1>And basically what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a study of search engine behavior.</v>

839
00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.960
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about 18,</v>

840
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:07.160
<v Speaker 1>19 percent of search engine behavior is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual in nature.</v>

841
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.720
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

842
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.310
<v Speaker 1>what are men doing and what are women </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>

843
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what men are doing.</v>

844
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.670
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at pictures of naked </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

845
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.870
<v Speaker 1>broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are women doing hot.</v>

846
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:19.820
<v Speaker 1>They're not looking at pictures of naked</v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

847
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.600
<v Speaker 1>They're reading about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women's pornography use his literary.</v>

848
00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's interesting.</v>

849
00:44:28.911 --> 00:44:33.911
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because actually women read more </v>

850
00:44:33.911 --> 00:44:33.911
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men by the way,</v>

851
00:44:33.911 --> 00:44:33.911
<v Speaker 1>women are more predisposed to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>

852
00:44:33.911 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Women seem to be more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>people than in things are very stable.</v>

853
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Cross cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender difference anyways,</v>

854
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:44.610
<v Speaker 1>so women are are reading about sex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that if you buy,</v>

855
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:47.580
<v Speaker 1>if you look at when I was a kid and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>on holidays,</v>

856
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.070
<v Speaker 1>summer holidays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom used to pack her a long,</v>

857
00:44:50.071 --> 00:44:53.610
<v Speaker 1>like 30 harlequin romances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what a harlequin romances.</v>

858
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Does everybody know what a harlequin </v>
<v Speaker 1>romances does?</v>

859
00:44:56.941 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Anybody not know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

860
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Most people know it's a cheap pulp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romance,</v>

861
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:08.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like deserving young women meets </v>

862
00:45:08.061 --> 00:45:11.750
<v Speaker 1>dashing and somewhat distant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's already with someone but </v>

863
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.250
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't deserve him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she turns him.</v>

864
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.400
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

865
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:20.630
<v Speaker 1>he decides that she's actually the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he gets that she gets to have </v>

866
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:21.360
<v Speaker 1>him and then everyone lives happily ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>

867
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:25.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's a harlequin romance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the original harlequin romances,</v>

868
00:45:25.921 --> 00:45:29.010
<v Speaker 1>they published millions of these bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>things was just that.</v>

869
00:45:29.011 --> 00:45:31.920
<v Speaker 1>And it was pretty plain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

870
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:36.921
<v Speaker 1>g rated story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But since the seventies harlequin has </v>

871
00:45:36.921 --> 00:45:37.710
<v Speaker 1>exploded and it's gone from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

872
00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:42.711
<v Speaker 1>g rated stories of disorder I told you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like triple x version and they're all</v>

873
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:48.321
<v Speaker 1>very popular and those sorts of stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>also reflected in female use of the </v>

874
00:45:49.111 --> 00:45:54.111
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you see is that they looked </v>

875
00:45:54.111 --> 00:45:54.990
<v Speaker 1>at beauty and the beast stories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's five major protagonists and this</v>

876
00:45:54.991 --> 00:45:57.060
<v Speaker 1>is something I think is so absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical.</v>

877
00:45:57.061 --> 00:46:02.061
<v Speaker 1>It just killed me when I first read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the five major guys in female x </v>

878
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.260
<v Speaker 1>rated pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

879
00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 1>We're wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

880
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.130
<v Speaker 1>vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

881
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

882
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Billionaire pirate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So isn't that funny man?</v>

883
00:46:18.091 --> 00:46:19.710
<v Speaker 1>It just blew me over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

884
00:46:19.711 --> 00:46:24.711
<v Speaker 1>it's not much different in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the male archetypal story of </v>

885
00:46:24.711 --> 00:46:24.711
<v Speaker 1>confronting the drag.</v>

886
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

887
00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:30.570
<v Speaker 1>and I'll show you something from </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping beauty that makes this very </v>

888
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:31.680
<v Speaker 1>clear what I'll show you that today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

889
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.710
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these are kind of bad guys,</v>

890
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.720
<v Speaker 1>while the world will fund the vampire in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

891
00:46:36.721 --> 00:46:38.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's the pirate up there too,</v>

892
00:46:38.551 --> 00:46:39.240
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

893
00:46:39.241 --> 00:46:43.890
<v Speaker 1>why would men like that figure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's archetipal sexual narratives?</v>

894
00:46:43.891 --> 00:46:45.300
<v Speaker 1>and the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

895
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.700
<v Speaker 1>what the hell good is a man who can't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

896
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about that and you know,</v>

897
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:53.100
<v Speaker 1>this bloody theme is played out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic comedies all the time.</v>

898
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Think about there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the girl and she has a friend,</v>

899
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of a guy that never grew up.</v>

900
00:46:59.281 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 1>He's usually say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>

901
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seth rogan.</v>

902
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.990
<v Speaker 1>He's usually seth rogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

903
00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.780
<v Speaker 1>and he's kind of jovial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice,</v>

904
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:12.790
<v Speaker 1>kind of funny and he's your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he really wants to sleep with her </v>

905
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.790
<v Speaker 1>and she knows that.</v>

906
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:14.970
<v Speaker 1>So she knows that he's not just her </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and he isn't just her friend.</v>

907
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
<v Speaker 1>He just likes to pretend that you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the guy that she's </v>

908
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.290
<v Speaker 1>interested in who's not like seth rogen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's got an edge to him,</v>

909
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:24.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the story is usually,</v>

910
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.940
<v Speaker 1>well it plays out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an interpLay between those three</v>

911
00:47:26.941 --> 00:47:29.860
<v Speaker 1>characters and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seth rogen always going,</v>

912
00:47:29.861 --> 00:47:32.080
<v Speaker 1>well why doesn't she like me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

913
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.960
<v Speaker 1>well you just watch them for 10 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know why?</v>

914
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Partly because she doesn't want a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>

915
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.560
<v Speaker 1>she wants someone who's good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and someone who's good for </v>

916
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.020
<v Speaker 1>something is someone who's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful edge.</v>

917
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:49.021
<v Speaker 1>And part of what happens in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the female archetype is that the </v>

918
00:47:49.021 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 1>female civilized is that at least in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to herself.</v>

919
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and then,</v>

920
00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then as far as I'm concerned,</v>

921
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.490
<v Speaker 1>that's not much different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said already in the male hero myth.</v>

922
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:08.100
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to show you first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you something from </v>

923
00:48:09.071 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 1>sleeping beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me just find it here.</v>

924
00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.470
<v Speaker 1>What's the universal video player?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vlc.</v>

925
00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

926
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.910
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got it downloaded because,</v>

927
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:40.690
<v Speaker 1>well these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stripped this machine every night </v>

928
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:40.910
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to always download </v>
<v Speaker 1>things over and over.</v>

929
00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:42.410
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

930
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk about the structure of </v>

931
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.891
<v Speaker 1>sleeping beauty for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a king and queen and uh,</v>

932
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:15.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live in a kingdom last logically </v>

933
00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.281
<v Speaker 1>enough and they're trying to have a baby</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't work out very well.</v>

934
00:49:17.891 --> 00:49:19.210
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

935
00:49:19.211 --> 00:49:22.900
<v Speaker 1>after time passes they have this baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl and her name is aurora.</v>

936
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:26.890
<v Speaker 1>So that sort of a reference to the sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

937
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you often see with archetypical </v>

938
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.550
<v Speaker 1>characters that are affiliated in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense with cosmic phenomena.</v>

939
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.710
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

940
00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.620
<v Speaker 1>kings and queens have plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

941
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:44.160
<v Speaker 1>And then divine figures have halos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's not much difference between</v>

942
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:47.950
<v Speaker 1>a kate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crown and a halo,</v>

943
00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:51.820
<v Speaker 1>and the crown is the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little points on it.</v>

944
00:49:51.821 --> 00:49:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Those are the rays of the sun or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>

945
00:49:53.861 --> 00:49:58.861
<v Speaker 1>It depends on whether the crown is made </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of gold or silver because gold is a </v>

946
00:49:58.861 --> 00:50:00.220
<v Speaker 1>solar metal and silver is a lunar metal.</v>

947
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And so when something is associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos,</v>

948
00:50:05.171 --> 00:50:08.350
<v Speaker 1>that means that it's gone from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit purely personal to the,</v>

949
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:13.720
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the impersonal or the transpersonal </v>

950
00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.640
<v Speaker 1>or the architectural and archetipal </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be not your father,</v>

951
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:19.090
<v Speaker 1>but the father as such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the spirit of the father,</v>

952
00:50:19.091 --> 00:50:21.430
<v Speaker 1>not your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the spirit of the mother as such.</v>

953
00:50:21.431 --> 00:50:23.350
<v Speaker 1>And so when you have the king and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>queen,</v>

954
00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:28.351
<v Speaker 1>you have the sun and the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the ruler of the night day </v>

955
00:50:28.351 --> 00:50:28.351
<v Speaker 1>scar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ruler of the night sky.</v>

956
00:50:28.351 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 1>You are the ruler over everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the light touches.</v>

957
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:34.790
<v Speaker 1>And you have the transpersonal fingers </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mother and father.</v>

958
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:39.791
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you see this in lots of movies </v>

959
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:45.340
<v Speaker 1>and hero stories in comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the most commonly portrayed pattern </v>

960
00:50:46.491 --> 00:50:48.830
<v Speaker 1>is that the hero has two sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

961
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:50.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry potter,</v>

962
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:55.610
<v Speaker 1>he's got the dursleys and they make them</v>
<v Speaker 1>live under the staircase.</v>

963
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:59.330
<v Speaker 1>And then he has his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cousin.</v>

964
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

965
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Dudley?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

966
00:51:04.191 --> 00:51:05.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

967
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:09.550
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The loan version of doug douglas.</v>

968
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.140
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad brother.</v>

969
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.720
<v Speaker 1>So they're actually the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hostile brothers,</v>

970
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero in adversary,</v>

971
00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.900
<v Speaker 1>and then he's got his ordinary parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are the parents that,</v>

972
00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're real ordinary.</v>

973
00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:25.090
<v Speaker 1>They live in an english suburb and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're extraordinarily conservative,</v>

974
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:30.140
<v Speaker 1>narrow minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want anything to do with </v>

975
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:30.410
<v Speaker 1>anything magic whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he has his heavenly parents who</v>

976
00:51:30.411 --> 00:51:32.390
<v Speaker 1>are his magic parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

977
00:51:32.391 --> 00:51:37.391
<v Speaker 1>And they come back and spirit for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then throughout the movie when </v>

978
00:51:37.391 --> 00:51:40.600
<v Speaker 1>he really needs them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So superman go to his earthy parents in </v>

979
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.110
<v Speaker 1>his heavenly parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

980
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:46.400
<v Speaker 1>If you go into onto wikipedia and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look up orphan hero,</v>

981
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:49.430
<v Speaker 1>I think they have a hundred and 60 of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them listed,</v>

982
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:53.480
<v Speaker 1>so same motif over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

983
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.670
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a teenager,</v>

984
00:51:55.671 --> 00:51:57.130
<v Speaker 1>one thing you think are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

985
00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Speaker 1>are these really my parents?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

986
00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:05.740
<v Speaker 1>And so an answer to that is yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's yes in that.</v>

987
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously from a strict immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological perspective,</v>

988
00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 1>they're your parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from an architectural perspective </v>

989
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

990
00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:19.900
<v Speaker 3>well</v>

991
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:24.530
<v Speaker 1>you have parents going back three and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half billion years.</v>

992
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Your parents or just the latest in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

993
00:52:27.771 --> 00:52:28.370
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

994
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:32.570
<v Speaker 1>very long line of parents and so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason you call your father,</v>

995
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:37.571
<v Speaker 1>dad or father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you happen to call them is </v>

996
00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 1>because it's in recognition of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the role you,</v>

997
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:43.070
<v Speaker 1>the relationship with you do you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him to some degree isn't personal.</v>

998
00:52:43.071 --> 00:52:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It's Archetipal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the father.</v>

999
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.670
<v Speaker 1>He plays that role for you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can even tell them when he's playing</v>

1000
00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:52.190
<v Speaker 1>in property because you might tell your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

1001
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1002
00:52:53.961 --> 00:52:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a very good father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1003
00:52:55.701 --> 00:52:57.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you know that,</v>

1004
00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started like you've got this idea in </v>

1005
00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.001
<v Speaker 1>your mind about what a good father would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like and if he's not doing that then </v>

1006
00:53:04.001 --> 00:53:04.001
<v Speaker 1>it's not him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1007
00:53:04.001 --> 00:53:06.530
<v Speaker 1>subject to your teenage and childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>misinterpretations.</v>

1008
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an awful mother all compared to </v>

1009
00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:11.530
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1010
00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:12.860
<v Speaker 1>compared to the ideal mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you might say,</v>

1011
00:53:12.861 --> 00:53:15.560
<v Speaker 1>well just who is this ideal mother?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1012
00:53:15.561 --> 00:53:18.140
<v Speaker 1>you can see her in religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations all the time.</v>

1013
00:53:18.141 --> 00:53:21.050
<v Speaker 1>So in christianity for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see you're represented as the virgin</v>

1014
00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:25.530
<v Speaker 1>mary who is the perfect mother and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why she's a holy figure and she's</v>

1015
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:27.450
<v Speaker 1>a holy figure apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypical figure,</v>

1016
00:53:27.451 --> 00:53:30.210
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because any society that doesn't worship</v>

1017
00:53:30.211 --> 00:53:35.211
<v Speaker 1>the mother and the infant dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be sacred because everybody </v>

1018
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:41.480
<v Speaker 1>starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has that relationship and if </v>

1019
00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.390
<v Speaker 1>the society doesn't support it properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and value it properly,</v>

1020
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:45.090
<v Speaker 1>then well then there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong with this society.</v>

1021
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:50.750
<v Speaker 1>So now sleeping duty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>king and queen baby.</v>

1022
00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:54.130
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got the.</v>

1023
00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.370
<v Speaker 1>We've got the familial trial going </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1024
00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:00.280
<v Speaker 1>So then they decided they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>chrisner they're going to name her,</v>

1025
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:05.300
<v Speaker 1>not sort of when she becomes an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and they make a mistake when </v>

1026
00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.490
<v Speaker 1>they're going to christener.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the mistake you remember?</v>

1027
00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.080
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have seen sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty?</v>

1028
00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many of you have it?</v>

1029
00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:13.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1030
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.720
<v Speaker 1>of those who haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you seen other disney movies?</v>

1031
00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen other disney movies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lion king.</v>

1032
00:54:21.561 --> 00:54:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything other than that?</v>

1033
00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anybody here who's never seen </v>

1034
00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:29.120
<v Speaker 1>an animated disney disney movie?</v>

1035
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:30.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1036
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you see how densely there wasn't </v>

1037
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:38.301
<v Speaker 1>anyone as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see how densely distributed </v>

1038
00:54:38.301 --> 00:54:39.000
<v Speaker 1>throughout the culture those stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1039
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:39.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they,</v>

1040
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>

1041
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:42.480
<v Speaker 1>very old stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even in a movie for them,</v>

1042
00:54:42.481 --> 00:54:44.530
<v Speaker 1>they're quite old for movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1043
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:49.550
<v Speaker 1>So the mistake they make is they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>invite the evil queen to the </v>

1044
00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:50.810
<v Speaker 1>christening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a multifacet.</v>

1045
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
<v Speaker 1>But obviously there's the dot tannic </v>
<v Speaker 1>undertone to that and you know that </v>

1046
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.700
<v Speaker 1>she's got these black horns that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>wears,</v>

1047
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:59.880
<v Speaker 1>like she's got this kate that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically on fire.</v>

1048
00:54:59.881 --> 00:55:04.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that she's an evil person </v>

1049
00:55:04.881 --> 00:55:04.881
<v Speaker 1>and so she's an archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the,</v>

1050
00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.260
<v Speaker 1>she's the archetype of the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine actually.</v>

1051
00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart story.</v>

1052
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:11.370
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1053
00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:14.220
<v Speaker 1>why would you invite something like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your daughter's christening?</v>

1054
00:55:14.221 --> 00:55:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you'd been waiting for her</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

1055
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:18.060
<v Speaker 1>And she's a real princess and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's perfect.</v>

1056
00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:19.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1057
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 1>here's another story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as another archetypal story.</v>

1058
00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:28.080
<v Speaker 1>So there's these kids and their mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets their father,</v>

1059
00:55:28.081 --> 00:55:31.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>separates or his wife dies or whatever.</v>

1060
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:36.770
<v Speaker 1>And so he picks up with this new woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she decides she doesn't really like </v>

1061
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:38.130
<v Speaker 1>these kids very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that happens a lot by the way.</v>

1062
00:55:38.131 --> 00:55:43.131
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a step parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are 100 times more likely to be </v>

1063
00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:48.051
<v Speaker 1>physically abused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the biggest single risk factors </v>

1064
00:55:48.051 --> 00:55:50.520
<v Speaker 1>up there with having a drunk parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1065
00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.730
<v Speaker 1>nasty little statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1066
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:58.880
<v Speaker 1>it's hard enough to tolerate kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when there's someone else's kids </v>

1067
00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.970
<v Speaker 1>that it makes it even more difficult and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a friday and observation and it's</v>

1068
00:55:59.971 --> 00:56:04.860
<v Speaker 1>no joke and people are not that friendly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's terrible jealousy.</v>

1069
00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a,</v>

1070
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:11.120
<v Speaker 1>if a man and a woman started going out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the woman has children and the man </v>

1071
00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:11.670
<v Speaker 1>is jealous and the children get in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1072
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.880
<v Speaker 1>especially if they also bother him </v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe they're not that happy </v>

1073
00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:16.880
<v Speaker 1>that he's not actually their father.</v>

1074
00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's just a creep for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1075
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:19.020
<v Speaker 1>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1076
00:56:19.021 --> 00:56:24.021
<v Speaker 1>the tension that can build up in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation like that can rapidly become </v>

1077
00:56:24.021 --> 00:56:25.120
<v Speaker 1>absolutely unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can last forever.</v>

1078
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:30.510
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she tells her new husband,</v>

1079
00:56:31.641 --> 00:56:36.641
<v Speaker 1>take those damn kids out in the bush and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you could lose them and so he's </v>

1080
00:56:36.641 --> 00:56:40.741
<v Speaker 1>not very happy with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess he's wrapped around the </v>

1081
00:56:40.741 --> 00:56:41.500
<v Speaker 1>finger of his new wife and not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>bright and kind of evil on his own.</v>

1082
00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:45.400
<v Speaker 1>So he takes the children out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest and leaves them there and so this</v>

1083
00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 1>is kind of hard on the children's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out in the wilderness,</v>

1084
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:52.920
<v Speaker 1>which is maybe how you feel when your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother dies and you know your father </v>

1085
00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.911
<v Speaker 1>goes and marries a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out in the bloody wilderness and </v>

1086
00:56:56.911 --> 00:57:00.030
<v Speaker 1>they get lost and then they're lost and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all freaked out because they're </v>

1087
00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:03.031
<v Speaker 1>lost and they're going to starve and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves are going to eat them because </v>

1088
00:57:03.031 --> 00:57:05.461
<v Speaker 1>this is like medieval europe forest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's full of wolves and the people and </v>

1089
00:57:05.461 --> 00:57:09.100
<v Speaker 1>so and they're wandering around out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they come across a gingerbread</v>

1090
00:57:09.101 --> 00:57:09.640
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

1091
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're a skepTical person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not naive,</v>

1092
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.110
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you think is this is too</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to be true.</v>

1093
00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1094
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:18.820
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1095
00:57:18.821 --> 00:57:20.320
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A shack maybe,</v>

1096
00:57:20.321 --> 00:57:23.260
<v Speaker 1>or even a lean to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure that could happen,</v>

1097
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.020
<v Speaker 1>but a house that's also made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>candy,</v>

1098
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:27.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nah,</v>

1099
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on there that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not so good.</v>

1100
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:32.650
<v Speaker 1>You know the kind of person that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really nice to you,</v>

1101
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:34.900
<v Speaker 1>but really isn't your member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1102
00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:37.420
<v Speaker 1>the Harry Potter series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that woman?</v>

1103
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.090
<v Speaker 1>She was a bureaucrat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Channel those plates of kittens.</v>

1104
00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Rich delores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delores means sad,</v>

1105
00:57:43.481 --> 00:57:45.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Umbrage means to take offense.</v>

1106
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:50.130
<v Speaker 1>So she's the sad woman who takes a fence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she got all these pictures of </v>

1107
00:57:50.261 --> 00:57:53.800
<v Speaker 1>kittens on her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on plates right there on ceramic plates.</v>

1108
00:57:53.801 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 1>And so those are like hyper sentimental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a pewter plates and everything</v>

1109
00:57:58.751 --> 00:58:00.670
<v Speaker 1>and we'll put them on our wall and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1110
00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:05.671
<v Speaker 1>it's like really low and taste and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentimentality is a facade.</v>

1111
00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:11.110
<v Speaker 1>You would call that a persona of </v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolence,</v>

1112
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:14.560
<v Speaker 1>but remember old dolores umbridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not exactly your benevolent type.</v>

1113
00:58:14.561 --> 00:58:15.130
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1114
00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:18.040
<v Speaker 1>you let her loose on the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible things happening.</v>

1115
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's her name?</v>

1116
00:58:19.541 --> 00:58:22.300
<v Speaker 1>The woman who wrote Harry Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got that exactly right.</v>

1117
00:58:22.301 --> 00:58:24.040
<v Speaker 1>It's one of her best characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1118
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:29.430
<v Speaker 1>So she's got that fake voice that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>often hear people who actually don't </v>

1119
00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:34.621
<v Speaker 1>like children use when they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to children are the cutest little thing </v>

1120
00:58:34.621 --> 00:58:39.210
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually talk to children and </v>

1121
00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:40.000
<v Speaker 1>they actually liked that and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think that,</v>

1122
00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:45.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're possessed by something that they </v>

1123
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:46.390
<v Speaker 1>should run away from as fast as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

1124
00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a hansel and greTel,</v>

1125
00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:52.630
<v Speaker 1>the woman comes out and she's all nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she said,</v>

1126
00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:54.160
<v Speaker 1>oh children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lost in the forest.</v>

1127
00:58:54.190 --> 00:58:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you come in and have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>ginger bread?</v>

1128
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:59.320
<v Speaker 1>And so then she puts little pencil in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage,</v>

1129
00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:04.740
<v Speaker 1>like a bird cage I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she gets gradle to do all the </v>

1130
00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:04.740
<v Speaker 1>slavery stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1131
00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:06.220
<v Speaker 1>so she's not so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everyday she goes,</v>

1132
00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:10.540
<v Speaker 1>she's stuffing on well with gingerbread </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she goes and feels little hats.</v>

1133
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:15.541
<v Speaker 1>Have legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he's nice and pumps so that she </v>

1134
00:59:15.541 --> 00:59:15.541
<v Speaker 1>can throw them in the stove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ANita.</v>

1135
00:59:15.541 --> 00:59:19.050
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that beware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are too nice to you because </v>

1136
00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:23.311
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to do is devour you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the prime dictum of freudian </v>

1137
00:59:24.051 --> 00:59:27.140
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a parent now,</v>

1138
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:32.141
<v Speaker 1>freud concentrated mostly on mothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>because mothers are more likely to do </v>

1139
00:59:32.141 --> 00:59:35.651
<v Speaker 1>this because for a variety of reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're not going to talk about </v>

1140
00:59:35.651 --> 00:59:36.680
<v Speaker 1>probably because they are oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards babies,</v>

1141
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.030
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're too nice to your child and you</v>

1142
00:59:41.031 --> 00:59:43.580
<v Speaker 1>do everything for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to them?</v>

1143
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Well then they can't do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1144
00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:53.020
<v Speaker 1>And so then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then they live in your basement </v>

1145
00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:53.020
<v Speaker 1>till they're 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1146
00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:55.880
<v Speaker 1>and then they get irritated one day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they shoot up dawson college.</v>

1147
00:59:56.750 --> 01:00:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So there's a deep metaphor in the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the story is if it's too damn good </v>

1148
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:06.881
<v Speaker 1>to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably aiming at your </v>

1149
01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:06.881
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1150
01:00:06.881 --> 01:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Now back to sleeping beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sleeping beauty,</v>

1151
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>aurora is going to be christened and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided not to invite the evil </v>

1152
01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>queen to the christening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not a very good idea.</v>

1153
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:20.630
<v Speaker 1>One time I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a composite client,</v>

1154
01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>so this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all she wanted to do with sleep,</v>

1155
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>so she'd sleep like 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 hours a day and she was doing that </v>

1156
01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 1>partly sleeping pills because it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sleep that much.</v>

1157
01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:33.410
<v Speaker 1>But left her own devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would just sleep.</v>

1158
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why would someone want to do that?</v>

1159
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1160
01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:44.501
<v Speaker 1>for the same reason that people drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves into unconsciousness and </v>

1161
01:00:44.501 --> 01:00:44.501
<v Speaker 1>oblivion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

1162
01:00:44.501 --> 01:00:49.181
<v Speaker 1>it's painful to be conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when your life isn't going </v>

1163
01:00:49.181 --> 01:00:49.181
<v Speaker 1>that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're afraid of things.</v>

1164
01:00:49.181 --> 01:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>And so why be awakened suffered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even be unconscious and not </v>

1165
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:58.061
<v Speaker 1>suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was basically her idea and </v>

1166
01:00:58.061 --> 01:00:58.061
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a vegetarian,</v>

1167
01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was terrified of butcher shops </v>

1168
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>and she was terrified of raw meat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was logical because she was sort of</v>

1169
01:01:06.531 --> 01:01:11.531
<v Speaker 1>terrified of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to be terrified of </v>

1170
01:01:11.531 --> 01:01:11.531
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really think about,</v>

1171
01:01:11.531 --> 01:01:14.711
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole bloody raw meat part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life that you're more or less terrified </v>

1172
01:01:14.711 --> 01:01:18.221
<v Speaker 1>by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was very concretized in her </v>

1173
01:01:18.221 --> 01:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I used to take her to </v>

1174
01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:22.541
<v Speaker 1>supermarkets through the raw meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>section because that's what you do in </v>

1175
01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy in case any of you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy,</v>

1176
01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to do the thing you least want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1177
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.360
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not particularly fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the gateway to enlightenment.</v>

1178
01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>You walked through the gate where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>least wanted,</v>

1179
01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you know why people aren't </v>

1180
01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>enlightened because it's not all fun and</v>
<v Speaker 1>games and follow your bliss and all that</v>

1181
01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:42.731
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like figure out what you're afraid </v>

1182
01:01:42.731 --> 01:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>of and avoiding and confronted </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily.</v>

1183
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:48.340
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a little background from her and </v>

1184
01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:51.110
<v Speaker 1>her mother who I met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is definitely the evil queen.</v>

1185
01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean she yelled at me for like 45 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes in my office.</v>

1186
01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.230
<v Speaker 1>It was really quite remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't had anyone.</v>

1187
01:01:57.530 --> 01:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I've only had one other person yelled at</v>
<v Speaker 1>me in my office ever and she was also </v>

1188
01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>definitely an evil queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this woman,</v>

1189
01:02:04.341 --> 01:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>she was just something else like it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just jaw dropping to watch her perform.</v>

1190
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:11.390
<v Speaker 1>And she used to phone up my client all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

1191
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>three or four times a day and tell her </v>
<v Speaker 1>how stupid and useless she was.</v>

1192
01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:19.300
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have parents that phone you up </v>

1193
01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>every day and tell you how stupid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>useless you are,</v>

1194
01:02:19.981 --> 01:02:24.981
<v Speaker 1>then it's perfectly within your rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>to not talk to them because that's what </v>

1195
01:02:24.981 --> 01:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>they should be telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you can say,</v>

1196
01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.250
<v Speaker 1>well how about if I call you instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you calling me?</v>

1197
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>And how about if it's once every two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks instead of three times a day?</v>

1198
01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:37.340
<v Speaker 1>And how about if you say anything nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hang up and then I don't talk to </v>

1199
01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:37.340
<v Speaker 1>you for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

1200
01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>well I couldn't do that to my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say,</v>

1201
01:02:39.691 --> 01:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>well that's because she already won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1202
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her mother loved her to death when she </v>

1203
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>was little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was perfect.</v>

1204
01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>She was a princess when she was little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then of course you hit puberty,</v>

1205
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's the end of the whole </v>

1206
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:59.091
<v Speaker 1>princess thing because then of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to go out and have a life and </v>

1207
01:02:59.091 --> 01:02:59.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>associate with boys and do all that sort</v>

1208
01:02:59.851 --> 01:03:00.150
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

1209
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:03.000
<v Speaker 1>That's not the least bit child princess </v>
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>

1210
01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:08.001
<v Speaker 1>And that's when everything broke down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and started to go in a very,</v>

1211
01:03:08.311 --> 01:03:13.311
<v Speaker 1>very bad direction and that was partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because her mom didn't want to invite </v>

1212
01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:17.691
<v Speaker 1>the evil queen to her little daughter's </v>
<v Speaker 1>life because the evil queen is the </v>

1213
01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:19.190
<v Speaker 1>negative part of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like if you,</v>

1214
01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 1>if you have a little girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the probability that she's going to</v>

1215
01:03:22.171 --> 01:03:27.171
<v Speaker 1>grow up and be a teenager and then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman is pretty high unless you do </v>

1216
01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:27.810
<v Speaker 1>something to seriously interfere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that which you might.</v>

1217
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>And so you bloody well better be </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared for that when she's three and </v>

1218
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:36.150
<v Speaker 1>not treat her like she's someone whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet are never going to touch the earth.</v>

1219
01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.470
<v Speaker 1>You have to have the whole element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life in there.</v>

1220
01:03:40.471 --> 01:03:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had another client,</v>

1221
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.880
<v Speaker 1>her parents taught her that adults were </v>
<v Speaker 1>angels and I don't mean metaphorically.</v>

1222
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:51.690
<v Speaker 1>They actually taught her that and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so,</v>

1223
01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.750
<v Speaker 1>they set her up for serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

1224
01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:59.751
<v Speaker 1>which she had for about five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she ran into someone who wasn't </v>

1225
01:03:59.751 --> 01:03:59.751
<v Speaker 1>an angel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprise,</v>

1226
01:03:59.751 --> 01:04:03.030
<v Speaker 1>surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all he did do her roughly speaking,</v>

1227
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:05.490
<v Speaker 1>was looking at her like he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill her.</v>

1228
01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:06.900
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1229
01:04:06.901 --> 01:04:08.790
<v Speaker 1>nobody could be traumatized like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1230
01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:09.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1231
01:04:09.211 --> 01:04:11.670
<v Speaker 1>probably no one's ever looked at you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1232
01:04:11.671 --> 01:04:13.680
<v Speaker 1>so don't be so sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But b,</v>

1233
01:04:13.681 --> 01:04:18.000
<v Speaker 1>if they did look at you like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought that adults were angels,</v>

1234
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:21.480
<v Speaker 1>then you were pretty much nicely set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

1235
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:26.930
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that you're doing your </v>

1236
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:27.960
<v Speaker 1>children a big favor by keeping the evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>queen out if their nursery,</v>

1237
01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:32.961
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might let them see a glimpse of her </v>

1238
01:04:32.961 --> 01:04:33.840
<v Speaker 1>now and then so they can get used to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that she exists.</v>

1239
01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:39.260
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's why children have </v>

1240
01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:39.260
<v Speaker 1>pets and part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1241
01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Because like mike's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't last very long.</v>

1242
01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:44.660
<v Speaker 1>So you have a live mouse for awhile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have a dead mouse and that's </v>

1243
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:48.021
<v Speaker 1>not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's some things that you </v>

1244
01:04:48.021 --> 01:04:48.021
<v Speaker 1>get accustomed to while you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1245
01:04:48.021 --> 01:04:52.731
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's not so good to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>your children from that because they're </v>

1246
01:04:52.731 --> 01:04:53.730
<v Speaker 1>going to have to grow up and survive in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the awful world.</v>

1247
01:04:53.731 --> 01:04:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And your job isn't to make them happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your job is to make them able to survive</v>

1248
01:04:58.411 --> 01:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>in the nasty real world anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1249
01:05:01.411 --> 01:05:03.750
<v Speaker 1>so that's what happens with sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty at the beginning.</v>

1250
01:05:03.751 --> 01:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like hansel and gretel and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil queen shows up anyways because good</v>

1251
01:05:08.731 --> 01:05:12.000
<v Speaker 1>luck keeping her out of your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she basically says,</v>

1252
01:05:12.001 --> 01:05:13.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's all well and good.</v>

1253
01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1254
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:17.190
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing I can do about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but come puberty roughly,</v>

1255
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.110
<v Speaker 1>and the sleeping beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1256
01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>she's going to prick your finger on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>needle on a spinning wheel.</v>

1257
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:28.470
<v Speaker 1>So there's blood involved there so we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to use our imagination too </v>

1258
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.700
<v Speaker 1>much to imagine what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm gonna,</v>

1259
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>come back and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1260
01:05:30.311 --> 01:05:35.311
<v Speaker 1>hell's gonna break loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course then the parents really </v>

1261
01:05:35.311 --> 01:05:39.301
<v Speaker 1>protect her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the wrong thing to do </v>

1262
01:05:39.301 --> 01:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the sleeping beauty story.</v>

1263
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prince comes along and he eventually</v>

1264
01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>figures out how to solve this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1265
01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.380
<v Speaker 1>She needs him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a pretty good guy.</v>

1266
01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Then evil queen puts him in a dungeon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like her basement and then she's </v>

1267
01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>going to keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're telling you so old that he can't</v>

1268
01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:59.551
<v Speaker 1>even ride and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to laugh at him as he tries </v>

1269
01:05:59.551 --> 01:06:02.290
<v Speaker 1>to leave and then he tries to leave and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she turns into a dragon.</v>

1270
01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:03.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

1271
01:06:03.071 --> 01:06:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is she turning into a drag?</v>

1272
01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:06.760
<v Speaker 1>But you accept that no problem.</v>

1273
01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Steve mcqueen turns into a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else would you do?</v>

1274
01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And then she spoke fire him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights are off.</v>

1275
01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:18.261
<v Speaker 1>And then he has to hack his way through </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the forums and thistles that have </v>

1276
01:06:18.261 --> 01:06:22.531
<v Speaker 1>gathered around the castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he wakes the girl up and the </v>

1277
01:06:22.531 --> 01:06:26.130
<v Speaker 1>fountains come back on and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy and you all think that's an </v>

1278
01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:26.130
<v Speaker 1>excellent story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1279
01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:30.920
<v Speaker 1>and it is an excellent story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a weird story because it's an </v>

1280
01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.110
<v Speaker 1>archetypal story and you understand it </v>
<v Speaker 1>at an architectural level.</v>

1281
01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me show you some of it.</v>

1282
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.700
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

1283
01:06:37.701 --> 01:06:40.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk a little bit more about it.</v>

1284
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:44.220
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at the beginning to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1285
01:06:44.221 --> 01:06:44.310
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1286
01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1287
01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:39.960
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1288
01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:45.170
<v Speaker 1>this is a class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want you to actually enjoy </v>

1289
01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:45.170
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to play around with.</v>

1290
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me about the book.</v>

1291
01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Is it a valuable book or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>

1292
01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's covered with gold and jewels for </v>

1293
01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:01.890
<v Speaker 1>what you're getting right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something valuable about this.</v>

1294
01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.880
<v Speaker 3>So your property.</v>

1295
01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1296
01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a valuable book.</v>

1297
01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Got gold and jewels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why or why is gold valuable?</v>

1298
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.410
<v Speaker 1>It's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1299
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:25.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like the sun looks like the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

1300
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:28.280
<v Speaker 1>If it's morally pure gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1301
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Because if it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it is wealthy.</v>

1302
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Even it's morally pure because it won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mix with other metals that doesn't meet </v>

1303
01:08:36.501 --> 01:08:41.501
<v Speaker 1>with other metals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's imperishable and it doesn't </v>

1304
01:08:41.501 --> 01:08:44.330
<v Speaker 1>tarnish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a symbol of purity and jewels.</v>

1305
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Why are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they beautiful?</v>

1306
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Invaluable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about rare.</v>

1307
01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Shining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1308
01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>they're shiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even chros can appreciate that.</v>

1309
01:08:52.281 --> 01:08:54.140
<v Speaker 1>So like what is shiny have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

1310
01:08:54.141 --> 01:08:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you think john sign?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1311
01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Reflects light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1312
01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.620
<v Speaker 1>So what do you want a good person to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1313
01:09:00.621 --> 01:09:01.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe you might say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1314
01:09:01.701 --> 01:09:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they reflect light.</v>

1315
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:08.320
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason that crystal's how are the </v>

1316
01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.491
<v Speaker 1>way they are translucent can reflect </v>
<v Speaker 1>light is because their internal </v>

1317
01:09:12.491 --> 01:09:16.001
<v Speaker 1>structure or crystal is a lattice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules and then that loudness is </v>

1318
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:18.500
<v Speaker 1>precisely replicated everywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crystal.</v>

1319
01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's one thing all the way down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the molecular level.</v>

1320
01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.090
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is that if,</v>

1321
01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:29.140
<v Speaker 1>especially if you think about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical model that we were talking </v>

1322
01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:29.900
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you were as well put together</v>

1323
01:09:29.901 --> 01:09:34.901
<v Speaker 1>as you could be and had maybe been </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to the right amount of heat and </v>

1324
01:09:34.901 --> 01:09:38.621
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would be the same thing at </v>

1325
01:09:38.621 --> 01:09:40.871
<v Speaker 1>every single level of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd Be solid and crystalline </v>

1326
01:09:40.871 --> 01:09:42.050
<v Speaker 1>and you would reflect light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so.</v>

1327
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:49.060
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a hit right off the bat that </v>

1328
01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:49.940
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That this story is valuable</v>

1329
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:09.430
<v Speaker 3>in a far away land is hysterically many </v>
<v Speaker 3>years have they own for child fun,</v>

1330
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:19.330
<v Speaker 3>which was granted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A doctor was for they call her yes,</v>

1331
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:30.550
<v Speaker 3>named her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asked her for.</v>

1332
01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:35.580
<v Speaker 3>She filled their lives with sunshine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then a great holiday was proclaimed </v>

1333
01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:41.670
<v Speaker 3>throughout the kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that all of high or low state might </v>

1334
01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:46.440
<v Speaker 3>pay homage to the infant princess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our story is one of the most joyful day,</v>

1335
01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:05.130
<v Speaker 3>good stephens to her going to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

1336
01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:14.190
<v Speaker 3>So these are the elements of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>feminine and they give her various gifts</v>

1337
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:20.290
<v Speaker 3>and ramble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quite distressed about receiving an </v>

1338
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:32.910
<v Speaker 3>invitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1339
01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:38.600
<v Speaker 3>well we're out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you a bunch more this next </v>

1340
01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.200
<v Speaker 3>next class and we'll see what it means.</v>
