00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Hi Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>

2
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Last lecture I talked to you a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit about construct validation and what </v>

4
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.961
<v Speaker 1>it means to measure something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're gonna take a bit of a </v>

5
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>detour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I told you about measurement problems</v>

6
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.340
<v Speaker 1>last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do your measurement properly in </v>

7
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>psychometrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're studying personality,</v>

8
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>if you're studying individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

9
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.140
<v Speaker 1>there are roughly six things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can discover and they can be broken up </v>

10
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big five model,</v>

11
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>extroversion and neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

12
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness,</v>

13
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.450
<v Speaker 1>and they can be subdivided as you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>know because it makes you read the </v>

14
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.261
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sub divided them into 10 APP turns </v>

15
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:06.381
<v Speaker 1>out to be quite useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for now we'll just presume that </v>

16
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:09.771
<v Speaker 1>there are five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other factor of human </v>

17
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>function that's pretty easy to derive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and measure his Iq.</v>

18
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq likely nests under openness.</v>

19
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Openness looks like it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly like intellect,</v>

20
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:26.391
<v Speaker 1>which is interested in ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably an ability with </v>

21
00:01:26.391 --> 00:01:29.811
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably measured better by </v>

22
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:32.451
<v Speaker 1>an Iq test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I asked her how smart you are and </v>

23
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:35.121
<v Speaker 1>you say you're pretty smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would give you a relatively high </v>

24
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>score on the intellect scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I tested your Iq,</v>

25
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:41.211
<v Speaker 1>I will get a better measure that not so </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense Iq nests inside the big </v>

26
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>five model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can think about it as a separate</v>

27
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>thing and I think it's reasonable to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

28
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>

30
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the big five was first invented,</v>

31
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>invented or discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you look at it,</v>

32
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned briefly as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was brute force statistics basically.</v>

33
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>So the idea behind the big five is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

34
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:09.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called the lexical hypothesis </v>

35
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis is that because human traits </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so important to us because we want </v>

36
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>to understand ourselves and perhaps even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more importantly,</v>

37
00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>we want to understand other people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we have language,</v>

38
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a reasonable probability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've encapsulated the structure of </v>

39
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>human personality within our language.</v>

40
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.500
<v Speaker 1>And so if you analyze the linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations properly,</v>

41
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>then perhaps you can extract out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central personality features.</v>

42
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically what the lexical </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis is and it's important to know</v>

43
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:46.311
<v Speaker 1>the lexical hypothesis and it's a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more sophisticated than that because it </v>

44
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:52.911
<v Speaker 1>basically presumed that you can extract </v>
<v Speaker 1>out route valid information about </v>

45
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:57.141
<v Speaker 1>personality from adjectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptive adjectives from phrases and </v>

46
00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:01.761
<v Speaker 1>from questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll get the same basic </v>

47
00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>dimensional structure regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 1>which of those techniques you use.</v>

48
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And that turns out to be true for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>intents and purposes.</v>

49
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lexical hypothesis depends on its </v>

50
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.351
<v Speaker 1>validity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends for its validity on the initial </v>

51
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:22.681
<v Speaker 1>claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that personality is accurately </v>

52
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:22.681
<v Speaker 1>represented within the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

53
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:27.061
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I would say is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a week paid five </v>

54
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis and a strong big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>

55
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:35.311
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The week big five hypothesis is that in </v>

56
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>so far as you use language to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

57
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>personality has a five factor structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's reliably extractable.</v>

58
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strong,</v>

59
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:49.111
<v Speaker 1>Big Five theory is that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no personality has a five factor </v>

60
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>structure and it's accurately </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented in language,</v>

61
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>but when you pull out the structure from</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

62
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>what you're pulling out is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of genuine personality.</v>

63
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Now the week hypothesis is I would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's established and it's worth knowing </v>

64
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.800
<v Speaker 1>because what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means is that if you invent a </v>

65
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire that has anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with self description,</v>

66
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>it might be self description at multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>different levels of analysis,</v>

67
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.660
<v Speaker 1>like values for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instead of just adjectives or </v>

68
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.190
<v Speaker 1>attitudes instead of just adjectives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these categories are sort of of a</v>

69
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>unclear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference between your </v>

70
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>attitude and your temperament?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

71
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually defined by the sentence </v>

72
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>that you used the word Zen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.760
<v Speaker 1>You extract out the words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of stand there alone.</v>

74
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to clarify their </v>

75
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

76
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lexical hypothesis I think is one of</v>

77
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:51.361
<v Speaker 1>the most well established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most well validated </v>

78
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:56.761
<v Speaker 1>claims in psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be the most validated </v>

79
00:04:56.761 --> 00:05:00.541
<v Speaker 1>claim apart from maybe the work that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>extracted Iq out from cognitive </v>

80
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

81
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>basically it was brute force statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

82
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:12.361
<v Speaker 1>people develop different lists of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjectives and you can complain in some </v>

83
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 1>ways about how they did it and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about that later.</v>

84
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>But because they tried to throw out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evaluative words like good and evil,</v>

85
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those aren't in the big five.</v>

86
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.850
<v Speaker 1>So they tried to only use adjectives </v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't necessarily seem to be like </v>

87
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>highly or valued or devalued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So introvert and extrovert,</v>

88
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>while they're opposites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

89
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.340
<v Speaker 1>is it better to be an introvert?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to be the extroverts like,</v>

90
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious.</v>

91
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:43.681
<v Speaker 1>So those were all the words that cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>that dimension can be kept in because </v>

92
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no value judgements associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

93
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.400
<v Speaker 1>And the originators of the big five </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory wanted to keep it as free of </v>

94
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>values as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's already a hypothesis,</v>

95
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:58.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hypothesis that you can come up </v>

96
00:05:58.051 --> 00:05:58.051
<v Speaker 1>with an accurate description of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

97
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.110
<v Speaker 1>even if you eliminate all the words that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do that are clearly vacancy.</v>

98
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did an experiment here a while back,</v>

99
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got hold of a data set of descriptive</v>

100
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>adjectives and we put all the evaluative</v>
<v Speaker 1>words back in,</v>

101
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.550
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:06:14.551 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>like nasty and horrible and awkward and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pool.</v>

103
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the good words as well,</v>

104
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral,</v>

105
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.500
<v Speaker 1>pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uplifting all of those things and,</v>

106
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.910
<v Speaker 1>and we had people rate people they liked</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people they didn't like using that </v>

107
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.350
<v Speaker 1>expanded list and we got a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype in some sense of the hateable </v>

108
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>person and a tremendous number of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>words that were used came from the value</v>

109
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>of dementia.</v>

110
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>So I think that when you throw out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>value of words,</v>

111
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 1>you actually throw out a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people actually use descriptive words to</v>

112
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:52.511
<v Speaker 1>describe because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you like someone or don't like </v>

113
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>someone if someone's likable or </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikable,</v>

114
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:56.470
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty important phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

115
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.290
<v Speaker 1>You hang around the people you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking and you don't </v>

116
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.290
<v Speaker 1>associate with the people you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

117
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.461
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fundamental choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll talk about that later because </v>

118
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.500
<v Speaker 1>there's reasons that happened and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons were valid and it's not that </v>

119
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 1>easy to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And besides that,</v>

120
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 1>the standard five factor model has all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of utility.</v>

121
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need to know what its strengths </v>

122
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>are and it's limitations are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>

123
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:26.591
<v Speaker 1>what you knew to draw out the five </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor model is you take magine the sec </v>

124
00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:30.761
<v Speaker 1>of all descriptive adjectives and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a random sample of those </v>

125
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 1>descriptive adjectives so that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>biased.</v>

126
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't use all of them because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

127
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:41.681
<v Speaker 1>if you ask someone to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves on a questionnaire using all </v>

128
00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 1>the adjectives we have that described </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

129
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 1>they'd be there for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not very efficient.</v>

130
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>So you want to take a random sample,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you only sample the words that </v>

131
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>people are most likely to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

132
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 1>if you go online and you'll find that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are word frequency tables,</v>

133
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of your language,</v>

134
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.760
<v Speaker 1>most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 500 words covers about 80 percent </v>

135
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.280
<v Speaker 1>of what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

136
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't remember what the lexicon of</v>

137
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:12.401
<v Speaker 1>the typical person is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in the neighborhood of </v>

138
00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:12.830
<v Speaker 1>3,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

139
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>but that might be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's like 750,000</v>

140
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 1>words in the English language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

141
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.740
<v Speaker 1>it's an omnivorous language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just pulled words in from all over </v>

142
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 1>and so you hardly use any of those words</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 1>and there's ones that are used </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily infrequently.</v>

144
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:33.250
<v Speaker 1>So what you could do is you could look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the total set of adjectives and then </v>

145
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 1>you can pull out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 1>identify the ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are used,</v>

147
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thousand most frequently used words </v>

148
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.201
<v Speaker 1>and that probably covered 95 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the territory and then you could pick </v>

149
00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:47.141
<v Speaker 1>out random set of a hundred and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could administer it to people and then </v>

150
00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:47.630
<v Speaker 1>you could factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze it,</v>

151
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.250
<v Speaker 1>administered to lots of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you factor analyze it and you get </v>

152
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 1>five relatively clear and stable factors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the most,</v>

153
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.490
<v Speaker 1>the one that comes out first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

154
00:08:58.491 --> 00:09:03.491
<v Speaker 1>it's the dominant factor in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the easiest to measure are maybe the </v>

155
00:09:03.491 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>best represented language or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

156
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:09.861
<v Speaker 1>It's extroversion versus introversion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and extroversion is a positive emotion </v>

157
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:16.371
<v Speaker 1>dimension and it's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm and assertiveness and </v>

158
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:25.250
<v Speaker 1>assertive people will say they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate the conversation with language </v>

159
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>or they'll well that basically that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right way to think about it.</v>

160
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm enthusiastic people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're up for anything,</v>

161
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:32.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that are always smiling</v>

162
00:09:32.961 --> 00:09:35.110
<v Speaker 1>and telling jokes and having parties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing.</v>

163
00:09:35.111 --> 00:09:39.210
<v Speaker 1>And generally extroverts really liked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be around people so they're happy.</v>

164
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>They're gregarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're assertive,</v>

165
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 1>they're enthusiastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're noisy,</v>

166
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>they blink more than introverts out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why that is.</v>

167
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently they do.</v>

168
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 1>So if you notice something blinking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>

169
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>you can assume that they're extroverts.</v>

170
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.750
<v Speaker 1>If they're not conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

171
00:09:57.751 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea of people being </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive.</v>

172
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:04.731
<v Speaker 1>It's very badly defined term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear a psychologist talking </v>

173
00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:07.731
<v Speaker 1>about impulsivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you could realize is </v>

174
00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:10.641
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the hell they're </v>

175
00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:11.190
<v Speaker 1>talking about because probably there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no such thing as impulsivity,</v>

176
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 1>but extroverted people who are not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious tend to.</v>

177
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:22.850
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about as associated with </v>

178
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 1>impulsivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of other things though</v>

179
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

180
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

181
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:30.351
<v Speaker 1>so there a positive emotion dimension </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's extroversion and there's a </v>

182
00:10:30.351 --> 00:10:30.351
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

183
00:10:30.351 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 1>dimension and that's neuroticism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotic.</v>

184
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Neuroticism seems to break down into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like withdrawal and volatility</v>

185
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.680
<v Speaker 1>and volatile people are touching so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

186
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.690
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll react quite a lot if something </v>

187
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.690
<v Speaker 1>negative happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you tease them,</v>

188
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.661
<v Speaker 1>they might get upset or if you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting with them and that sort of </v>

189
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:50.010
<v Speaker 1>provocative way instead of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>calming everything down there,</v>

190
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.210
<v Speaker 1>just ramp it up.</v>

191
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And if there's two of you that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>volatile and you're having a </v>

192
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 1>conversation and the conversation goes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

193
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into unpleasant territory,</v>

194
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.980
<v Speaker 1>you can really get each other going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

195
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>like in terms of the hero and I can turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>those states both.</v>

196
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

197
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's part of the problem with </v>

198
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.800
<v Speaker 1>using the word emotion because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an emotion,</v>

199
00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:17.801
<v Speaker 1>an internal state or a set of behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that as far as we can </v>

200
00:11:17.801 --> 00:11:17.801
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's both.</v>

201
00:11:17.801 --> 00:11:22.580
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm going to start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion and neuroticism.</v>

202
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.750
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think the evidence for the </v>

203
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.030
<v Speaker 1>relationship between those traits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the brain functions functions is</v>

204
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:38.031
<v Speaker 1>in some sense the clearest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember the baby five were </v>

205
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:39.630
<v Speaker 1>extracted out using statistical </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures,</v>

206
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:44.631
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no reason to assume </v>

207
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:46.701
<v Speaker 1>necessarily that the traits would bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>any straightforward relationship to </v>

208
00:11:46.701 --> 00:11:49.530
<v Speaker 1>brain function because they didn't.</v>

209
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.930
<v Speaker 1>They weren't derived from analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain function,</v>

210
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:57.230
<v Speaker 1>at least not directly they were at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were extracted from analysis of </v>

211
00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>linguistic representations of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>peoples and your own behavior.</v>

212
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:05.790
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that there's quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>concordance between certain elements of </v>

213
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:10.621
<v Speaker 1>neuro psychological theory and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative emotional traits,</v>

214
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 1>extroversion and neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm going to do today is I'm</v>

215
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

216
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:21.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to you about how positive and </v>

217
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.851
<v Speaker 1>negative emotions are are instantiated </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense neurologically.</v>

218
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going to put that in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a broader picture of brain function.</v>

219
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Because while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>

220
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:34.450
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

221
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of the things I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you about the brain today will sort</v>

222
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 1>of retroactively shed light on some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the clinical theories that we've already</v>

223
00:12:41.771 --> 00:12:43.300
<v Speaker 1>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

224
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 1>so which is nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:48.520
<v Speaker 1>because when one of the ways that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out if something is true,</v>

226
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 1>and this is something we also talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about during the last lecture,</v>

227
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:56.101
<v Speaker 1>is that it manifests itself even when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you use different measurement </v>

228
00:12:56.621 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 1>techniques.</v>

229
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And so you had this statistical </v>
<v Speaker 1>derivation which basically took place.</v>

230
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.870
<v Speaker 1>It really started to accelerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say first in the 19 sixties and </v>

231
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.530
<v Speaker 1>then in the 19 eighties it made a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>comeback in the 19 eighties,</v>

232
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.950
<v Speaker 1>but paralleling that were theories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain development and they weren't </v>

233
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.431
<v Speaker 1>really the scientists that were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one sort of research really work </v>

234
00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 1>communicating with the scientists that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing the other kind of research.</v>

235
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 1>So they were methodologically separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use different techniques as well.</v>

236
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:27.790
<v Speaker 1>They weren't talking back and forth much</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were using different </v>

237
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.531
<v Speaker 1>measurement techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they both come up with the same </v>

238
00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:31.531
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

239
00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:35.701
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's probably something to that </v>

240
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:36.510
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the sighted people discovered it and</v>

241
00:13:36.511 --> 00:13:39.640
<v Speaker 1>the people who could hear discovered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same kind of idea.</v>

242
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

243
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:47.431
<v Speaker 1>this has been worked out in a fair bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of detail over the last 30 years really.</v>

244
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

245
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the papers that you're supposed to read </v>

246
00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:58.340
<v Speaker 1>with their difficult papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

247
00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I believe you're reading gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a model of the limbic system </v>

248
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.430
<v Speaker 1>and Basal Ganglia applications to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and schizophrenia.</v>

249
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

250
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.320
<v Speaker 1>I think you have goals and behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the carbon shyer paper.</v>

251
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I put the Swanson paper in as optional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cerebral hemisphere regulation of</v>

252
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 1>motivated behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a tough paper.</v>

253
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 1>And so is the gray paper and it's partly</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of these guys,</v>

254
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.840
<v Speaker 1>both of them graze paper is that is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>distillation of a very,</v>

255
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 1>very thick book that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>

256
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:33.091
<v Speaker 1>And that's been written twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was published first in 1982 and then </v>

257
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 1>again in 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant book.</v>

258
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.550
<v Speaker 1>It's had a tremendous impact on </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

259
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Gray was one of those people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so damn smart.</v>

260
00:14:39.821 --> 00:14:41.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

261
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:46.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean his reference list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many papers are in his </v>

262
00:14:46.081 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 1>reference list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 2000.</v>

263
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.240
<v Speaker 1>And one of the really weird things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>gray that makes them stand out among </v>

264
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.790
<v Speaker 1>scientists is he actually read all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more than that,</v>

265
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 1>he understood them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really something.</v>

266
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 1>And so greatest book on anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

267
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.410
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

268
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.100
<v Speaker 1>he did a lot of work with animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

269
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you if you want like solid </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological information about how the </v>

270
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:10.760
<v Speaker 1>brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that you pay attention to are</v>

271
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:12.670
<v Speaker 1>the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

272
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.340
<v Speaker 1>the people who are studying animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and animal grades.</v>

273
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.490
<v Speaker 1>They know what they're doing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So methodologically careful.</v>

274
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:24.491
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very reliable and the human neuro </v>

275
00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and the people who use pet</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards and Mris and all that thing.</v>

276
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.840
<v Speaker 1>There are way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

277
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:31.841
<v Speaker 1>way behind the animal researchers </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the animal researchers can just </v>

278
00:15:31.841 --> 00:15:35.411
<v Speaker 1>get in there at a lot higher resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can do much more stringent </v>

279
00:15:35.411 --> 00:15:37.370
<v Speaker 1>experiments and they tend to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>methodological,</v>

280
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 1>careful and more scientifically minded.</v>

281
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.350
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gradebook is a brilliant book.</v>

282
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:44.750
<v Speaker 1>It's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me like four months to read that</v>

283
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:49.490
<v Speaker 1>damn book and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really had to take it apart because he</v>

284
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.640
<v Speaker 1>probably had 30 years of work into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

285
00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:56.440
<v Speaker 1>And like he worked a lot in 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:15:56.441 --> 00:16:01.441
<v Speaker 1>he did a lot of experimentation and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>read lot and so he built a bottle of </v>

287
00:16:01.441 --> 00:16:04.721
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the brain's function that was based </v>

288
00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 1>on partly on Russian neuropsychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly on cybernetic theory,</v>

289
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:11.090
<v Speaker 1>hardly on animal behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly on neuropsychopharmacology.</v>

290
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:16.091
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the study of how drugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>affect behavior and cognition and then </v>

291
00:16:16.091 --> 00:16:19.790
<v Speaker 1>partly partly from a higher order </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual perspective.</v>

292
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:24.791
<v Speaker 1>And then he stacked all those things up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one on top of the other to make sure </v>

293
00:16:24.791 --> 00:16:26.540
<v Speaker 1>that the picture was the same at every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single level of analysis.</v>

294
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely brilliant work.</v>

295
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And it took the social psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they really started thinking about </v>

296
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.790
<v Speaker 1>gray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he published his book in 1982,</v>

297
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:38.600
<v Speaker 1>they probably started thinking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great seriously in about 2005,</v>

298
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.930
<v Speaker 1>so it took 23 years for his book to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to make its widescale entrance </v>

299
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:47.150
<v Speaker 1>into the more general psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

300
00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're going to read this paper,</v>

301
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 1>which is a model of the limbic system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Basal Ganglia and it's a distillery.</v>

302
00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:00.430
<v Speaker 1>It's 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were distilled into the book and then </v>

303
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:00.640
<v Speaker 1>that was distilled into this paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

304
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.530
<v Speaker 1>it's rough going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the Swanson paper,</v>

305
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 1>he's another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same kind of guy.</v>

306
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:10.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a developmental neuro anatomist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're really interested in </v>

307
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:15.221
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would really recommend reading those </v>

308
00:17:15.221 --> 00:17:16.070
<v Speaker 1>papers because like they're hard going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you get it,</v>

309
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.960
<v Speaker 1>you have this substrata of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath you that's really firmed.</v>

310
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.080
<v Speaker 1>And I rated like Swanson's paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy's a genius.</v>

311
00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:29.081
<v Speaker 1>And what's so cool about Swanson's paper</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you talked to human neuro </v>

312
00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:33.581
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that they're biased towards </v>

313
00:17:33.581 --> 00:17:33.860
<v Speaker 1>the cerebral cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's sort of.</v>

314
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.890
<v Speaker 1>I think there's sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropomorphic pride that goes along </v>

315
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:38.890
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

316
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are we different from animals?</v>

317
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:43.490
<v Speaker 1>we've got thumbs and not great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooray for the thumbs and you stand up,</v>

319
00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:43.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

320
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.120
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at us neurologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big differences that we have this </v>

321
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 1>tremendously expanded cerebral cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the prefrontal cortex.</v>

322
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And so then people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

323
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:58.101
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that </v>

324
00:17:58.101 --> 00:18:00.201
<v Speaker 1>differentiates us from animals and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively evolutionarily modern because</v>

325
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:04.170
<v Speaker 1>the human brain really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really developed rapidly over the last 2</v>

326
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 1>million years that it's like king of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain in some sense,</v>

327
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:13.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's the place where all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated things happen and that's </v>

328
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.730
<v Speaker 1>just not right.</v>

329
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Because like breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's complicated.</v>

330
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:21.830
<v Speaker 1>That's why you don't get to control it </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily and keeping your heart </v>

331
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.560
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's complicated too.</v>

332
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:24.720
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't get to have a decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

333
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Your brain has made that automatic like </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years ago because there's </v>

334
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:34.941
<v Speaker 1>just no way you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary control over something that's </v>

335
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:34.941
<v Speaker 1>that vital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

336
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:39.651
<v Speaker 1>So assuming that newer brain areas do </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex things is in some ways I </v>

337
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 1>think that's actually precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>

338
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 1>It's the old brain areas that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>around for 100,</v>

339
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 1>$100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years.</v>

340
00:18:47.941 --> 00:18:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Those damn things are smart and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>why they've survived for so long and why</v>

341
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:55.170
<v Speaker 1>they're distributed and into so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different species.</v>

342
00:18:55.171 --> 00:18:56.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

343
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.460
<v Speaker 1>your brain is somewhat like a lobster's </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

344
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot like a mouse brain and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot like a rat brain and you might </v>

345
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.931
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the rapper and isn't a very good </v>

346
00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:08.931
<v Speaker 1>model of a human brain because after all</v>
<v Speaker 1>their rats.</v>

347
00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:13.640
<v Speaker 1>But one thing I can tell you is that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rat brain is a way better model of a </v>

348
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.271
<v Speaker 1>human brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then your model of a human brain is a </v>

349
00:19:17.271 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 1>model of the human brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

350
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:21.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like people think of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they have a dopey model.</v>

351
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Using Iraq as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's,</v>

352
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.390
<v Speaker 1>it's often some ways because rats can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk for example,</v>

353
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:31.850
<v Speaker 1>but there are so many levels of analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you.</v>

354
00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:33.780
<v Speaker 1>You might as well be a wrap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.540
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that neuropharmacology,</v>

356
00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:37.470
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

357
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:40.350
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The function of the neurotransmitters,</v>

358
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:45.470
<v Speaker 1>the basic anatomy of the structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a tremendous amount of </v>

359
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:50.660
<v Speaker 1>overlap and so you might as well go for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the commonalities among brains before </v>

360
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:54.510
<v Speaker 1>you focusing on the differences because </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense that way you get the basic</v>

361
00:19:54.511 --> 00:19:59.511
<v Speaker 1>architecture right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things that's really </v>

362
00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:02.811
<v Speaker 1>interesting about Swanson and this makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and he's not a neuropsychologist and</v>

363
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.590
<v Speaker 1>he's not really even a psychologist.</v>

364
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:10.370
<v Speaker 1>He's a developmental neuro anatomist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's lots of ways of piecing of </v>

365
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 1>chopping up the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

366
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.310
<v Speaker 1>to look at it because it's a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated thing.</v>

367
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

368
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:18.150
<v Speaker 1>how many ways can you divide up a city </v>
<v Speaker 1>to analyze it?</v>

369
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

370
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.240
<v Speaker 1>there's endless numbers of ways that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can divide up the city to look at it.</v>

371
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.430
<v Speaker 1>And there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with the brain,</v>

372
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:31.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's infinitely subdivided will </v>

373
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.030
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly all the way down to the </v>

374
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:35.490
<v Speaker 1>molecular structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then even at higher order levels,</v>

375
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so complex and it's </v>

376
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.861
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just divide it up in all sorts </v>

377
00:20:42.861 --> 00:20:46.011
<v Speaker 1>of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so at higher levels of resolution </v>

378
00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>there isn't even that much agreement on </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to name the parts.</v>

379
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Now what the developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroanatomists do is that they look at </v>

380
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.590
<v Speaker 1>how the brain develops in uteral over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

381
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:58.750
<v Speaker 1>So because it's a developing thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of unfold like a flower unfold,</v>

382
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can track how the,</v>

383
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which part of the early brain turns into</v>

384
00:21:04.281 --> 00:21:09.281
<v Speaker 1>the later braid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can get some sense of the </v>

385
00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like an evolutionary tree,</v>

386
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:15.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if these three parts grew out of this </v>

387
00:21:15.331 --> 00:21:17.971
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can assume that there's some </v>

388
00:21:17.971 --> 00:21:19.771
<v Speaker 1>commonality between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can also help you figure out </v>

389
00:21:19.771 --> 00:21:22.651
<v Speaker 1>how to divide up the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one of the things that </v>

390
00:21:22.651 --> 00:21:22.651
<v Speaker 1>Swanson does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing he does,</v>

391
00:21:22.651 --> 00:21:27.541
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that instead of looking at the brain </v>

392
00:21:27.541 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 1>from the top down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what human psychologist tend to</v>

393
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 1>do because they concentrate on st </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

394
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:34.540
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher order cognitive functions,</v>

395
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.960
<v Speaker 1>which we think of as complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you think they're not that damn </v>

396
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:39.960
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

397
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.920
<v Speaker 1>like a computer can do mathematics so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much better than you that there's not </v>

398
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.660
<v Speaker 1>even any comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

399
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.480
<v Speaker 1>and it won't be very long before.</v>

400
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.960
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the things that we think of as </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract cognition are things that </v>

401
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.600
<v Speaker 1>computers are going to be able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

402
00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:54.820
<v Speaker 1>They just want to go tournament for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

403
00:21:55.150 --> 00:22:00.150
<v Speaker 1>and the computers are now better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even your pc is better at playing chess </v>

404
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.561
<v Speaker 1>than probably anyone in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the really high end computers are </v>

405
00:22:04.561 --> 00:22:08.281
<v Speaker 1>better at playing chess that anyone who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who lives and so computers are catching </v>

406
00:22:08.281 --> 00:22:12.541
<v Speaker 1>up damn fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll notice that they don't do </v>

407
00:22:12.541 --> 00:22:13.720
<v Speaker 1>things like bus tables in restaurants </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it turns out that's really hard.</v>

408
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about it,</v>

409
00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:16.780
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

410
00:22:16.781 --> 00:22:18.940
<v Speaker 1>you're carrying different size loads all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

411
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.000
<v Speaker 1>You have to interact socially with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people properly.</v>

412
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.830
<v Speaker 1>You have to stay the hell out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

413
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.950
<v Speaker 1>You have to exactly time when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to come to the table,</v>

414
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:32.490
<v Speaker 1>you know you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to move extraordinarily </v>

415
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:32.490
<v Speaker 1>efficiently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as the place gets busy,</v>

416
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:37.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of demands on you to do </v>

417
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:38.290
<v Speaker 1>that job effectively and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think about it as a low end job,</v>

418
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 1>but it's not automated.</v>

419
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.980
<v Speaker 1>The low end jobs are the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be automated first and it's not</v>

420
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:50.070
<v Speaker 1>obvious that they're going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we associated with low end </v>

421
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.070
<v Speaker 1>labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.840
<v Speaker 1>it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now Swanson's did with the nervous </v>

423
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.040
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

424
00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I was so happy when I found this paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he did exactly what the nervous </v>

425
00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.750
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what piaget did with children.</v>

426
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:07.200
<v Speaker 1>He showed how the nervous system builds </v>
<v Speaker 1>self from the bottom up and so swanson </v>

427
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.060
<v Speaker 1>and lays right on top of piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's lovely.</v>

428
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.970
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that's wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>and does very,</v>

429
00:23:12.971 --> 00:23:17.350
<v Speaker 1>very nicely as the elucidates a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Freudian presuppositions,</v>

430
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Freud of course talk about the ID and</v>

431
00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:24.940
<v Speaker 1>the ID is this sort of like the archaic </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain in some sense.</v>

432
00:23:24.941 --> 00:23:25.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

433
00:23:25.421 --> 00:23:28.940
<v Speaker 1>we're all your primal impulses alert and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.050
<v Speaker 1>he called that one thing that in while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

435
00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:33.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there an IED in the brain?</v>

436
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.580
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaguely vaguely the,</v>

437
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:46.470
<v Speaker 1>the brain does differ in terms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the age of it's sub components and as</v>

438
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:49.520
<v Speaker 1>you go deeper into the brain and closer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the spine,</v>

439
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.940
<v Speaker 1>the brain areas get find a genetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>older and the more phylogenetically </v>

440
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.750
<v Speaker 1>genetically older areas of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are underneath the cortex.</v>

441
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 1>They have their own little circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

442
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 1>and there's some commonality between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they do govern tribal.</v>

443
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.650
<v Speaker 1>I think of them as primal </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities.</v>

444
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.630
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've talked about that before.</v>

445
00:24:08.631 --> 00:24:13.631
<v Speaker 1>It's better than thinking about them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives or goals or anything like that </v>

446
00:24:13.631 --> 00:24:17.540
<v Speaker 1>because not only do they do they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

447
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.300
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sets of associated behaviors,</v>

448
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:25.390
<v Speaker 1>but they're not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also ways of looking at the </v>

449
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:25.700
<v Speaker 1>world and ways of thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

450
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.100
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're angry,</v>

451
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being driven to use your fists.</v>

452
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.880
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that the angry </v>

453
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:36.880
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

454
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Speaker 1>and it does a whole bunch of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

455
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:44.051
<v Speaker 1>it's got its own state of arousal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's characterized both by positive and </v>

456
00:24:44.051 --> 00:24:45.680
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that's quite peculiar</v>

457
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:50.681
<v Speaker 1>about anger because it's both a </v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive reaction and an aggressive </v>

458
00:24:50.681 --> 00:24:54.590
<v Speaker 1>forward moving behavior and it has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint like it's a biased viewpoint.</v>

459
00:24:54.591 --> 00:24:59.591
<v Speaker 1>If you're angry with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you can see about them is how damn </v>

460
00:24:59.591 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 1>irritating they are and how much they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be defeated,</v>

461
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:01.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

462
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.670
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a whole personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

463
00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:07.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a one dimensional personality has </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

464
00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 1>It's really God is anger and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to solve every problem,</v>

465
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:17.170
<v Speaker 1>but you can't think about it as a drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly because it's also because it's </v>

466
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:17.840
<v Speaker 1>not deterministic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

467
00:25:17.841 --> 00:25:21.920
<v Speaker 1>it's even when you're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a range of choices to make.</v>

468
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Now there are circumscribed by the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're angry,</v>

469
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

470
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's best to think about it as a sub</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

471
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I think you just get a lot farther that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

472
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Now what Swanson did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how Psj talked about children,</v>

473
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.080
<v Speaker 1>infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start out with a few fundamental </v>

474
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.080
<v Speaker 1>reflexes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

475
00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.950
<v Speaker 1>That they're sort of born with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the ability to use their mouth</v>

476
00:25:42.951 --> 00:25:47.951
<v Speaker 1>and they're telling me as an exploratory</v>
<v Speaker 1>a device and then they have certain </v>

477
00:25:48.201 --> 00:25:53.201
<v Speaker 1>reflexes that they can manifest right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away and then they have the ability to </v>

478
00:25:53.201 --> 00:25:55.250
<v Speaker 1>modify those reflexes and so as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget was concerned,</v>

479
00:25:55.251 --> 00:26:00.251
<v Speaker 1>that was enough to get the ball rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sorta like the child was booting </v>

480
00:26:00.251 --> 00:26:00.980
<v Speaker 1>up across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got some,</v>

481
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the operating system,</v>

482
00:26:03.321 --> 00:26:08.321
<v Speaker 1>you've got some bare processes in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer that get it started enough so </v>

483
00:26:08.321 --> 00:26:09.620
<v Speaker 1>the operating system can turn on.</v>

484
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.080
<v Speaker 1>It sort of unfolds up into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

485
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of what human beings do </v>

486
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:17.320
<v Speaker 1>across time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start out with these basic reflexes</v>

487
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:22.630
<v Speaker 1>that are simple movements and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to modify the movements and </v>

488
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.961
<v Speaker 1>then they learn how to chain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements together and then they learn </v>

489
00:26:25.961 --> 00:26:28.931
<v Speaker 1>how to use the chain movements as tools </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense as embodied tools to </v>

490
00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:34.571
<v Speaker 1>pursue to to allow these biologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined subpersonalities to operate </v>

491
00:26:36.171 --> 00:26:38.120
<v Speaker 1>in the world with some chance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

492
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

493
00:26:39.371 --> 00:26:44.371
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can layer that onto the nervous </v>

494
00:26:44.371 --> 00:26:44.371
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so partly what's happening when you get,</v>

495
00:26:44.371 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 1>when you get these basic movements down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are now automatic,</v>

496
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:52.311
<v Speaker 1>like your ability to grip and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to do this with your hands and </v>

497
00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 1>all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the basic sub routines you have with</v>

498
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:56.760
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are automatized.</v>

499
00:26:56.761 --> 00:27:01.761
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're made into little machines and </v>

500
00:27:01.761 --> 00:27:03.240
<v Speaker 1>lot of them run spinal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know because what you think in </v>

501
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.821
<v Speaker 1>some sense is that if you're walking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about walking in some </v>

502
00:27:07.821 --> 00:27:07.821
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

503
00:27:07.821 --> 00:27:07.950
<v Speaker 1>That's how you walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

504
00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:11.180
<v Speaker 1>that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is you orient yourself to a</v>

505
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:16.190
<v Speaker 1>goal and in some sense you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>disinhibit the system that knows how to </v>

506
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.770
<v Speaker 1>walk and then it more or less does it </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically and you know you direct it</v>

507
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:22.590
<v Speaker 1>and you can modify what it's doing if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an error,</v>

508
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 1>but you kind of know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

509
00:27:24.181 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 1>You drive to school or you drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere you're familiar to.</v>

510
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't even even necessarily remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drive.</v>

511
00:27:30.361 --> 00:27:35.361
<v Speaker 1>If you've done it 50 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you're basically in some </v>

512
00:27:35.361 --> 00:27:39.381
<v Speaker 1>sense you just sequencing automated </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors and are good thing too because</v>

513
00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't have those automated </v>
<v Speaker 1>expert behaviors at hand,</v>

514
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.840
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't know how to drive because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

515
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.500
<v Speaker 1>You're just not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the time when you drive most </v>

516
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.800
<v Speaker 1>consciously is when you first learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to drive.</v>

517
00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want a conscious thriver.</v>

518
00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:01.040
<v Speaker 1>You want an unconscious expert driver </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose consciousness is monitoring the </v>

519
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.000
<v Speaker 1>world for anything unexpected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want.</v>

520
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.480
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the case for almost </v>

521
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.831
<v Speaker 1>everything you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have to become conscious of what </v>

522
00:28:09.831 --> 00:28:13.191
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you don't do it </v>

523
00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:13.191
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really high.</v>

524
00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:16.700
<v Speaker 1>And you know that because maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to someone happens when I'm </v>

525
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.001
<v Speaker 1>lecturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if I'm not really on top of </v>

526
00:28:20.001 --> 00:28:22.551
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get self conscious and that's a </v>

527
00:28:22.551 --> 00:28:22.551
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing to have happened when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture,</v>

528
00:28:22.551 --> 00:28:23.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just makes you stumble.</v>

529
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.520
<v Speaker 1>If it's going well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know where I'm going and I'd have all </v>

530
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:28.520
<v Speaker 1>these little routines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

531
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.890
<v Speaker 1>that our stories and things that I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they just automatically sequence.</v>

532
00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:36.150
<v Speaker 1>All I have to do is point the lecture in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right direction and you know,</v>

533
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.520
<v Speaker 1>the things that are logically associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

534
00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:39.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

535
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the direction of the lecture will,</v>

536
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.540
<v Speaker 1>they'll come up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're primed in some sense.</v>

537
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.840
<v Speaker 1>And so Swanson helped me understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>functions of the lower part of the brain</v>

538
00:28:51.841 --> 00:28:54.410
<v Speaker 1>quite well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to map that onto piaget and l,</v>

539
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.480
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he helped me </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand was just exactly how </v>

540
00:28:59.480 --> 00:28:59.970
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated the lower parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain are.</v>

541
00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:04.971
<v Speaker 1>The more automatic parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the behaviorists used to believe </v>

542
00:29:04.971 --> 00:29:06.990
<v Speaker 1>that or did believe and still believe to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>

543
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:09.960
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of your behavior is </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflexive.</v>

544
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.260
<v Speaker 1>And the radical behavior is the guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the fifties,</v>

545
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:18.530
<v Speaker 1>but more or less made the case that even</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex behavior among animals is </v>

546
00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.030
<v Speaker 1>nothing but the chaining together a </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatic reflexes.</v>

547
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.630
<v Speaker 1>So it was deterministic chain of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflexes.</v>

548
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do have reflex actions,</v>

549
00:29:27.481 --> 00:29:29.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you touch a hot stove,</v>

550
00:29:29.671 --> 00:29:32.880
<v Speaker 1>you'll jerk your hand away and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain isn't involved in that.</v>

551
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just your spinal cord that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in that.</v>

552
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Now your brain's involved when the pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>hits.</v>

553
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.740
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's so that you stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it in the future,</v>

554
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:46.050
<v Speaker 1>but you're the conscious part of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is too slow to get your hand away </v>

555
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the stove in time.</v>

556
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 1>And so what's happening in your body in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some senses that you have these multiple</v>

557
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:56.120
<v Speaker 1>layers of neurological organization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them are quite fixed there.</v>

558
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Their automatic deterministic systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are things you really,</v>

559
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:02.980
<v Speaker 1>really practiced and that you can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>run as a routine.</v>

560
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:08.370
<v Speaker 1>And then above that are the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are those things that you've chained </v>

561
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:08.830
<v Speaker 1>together but they could be chained </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in different ways.</v>

562
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.710
<v Speaker 1>So they're less automatized and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going up.</v>

563
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.740
<v Speaker 1>They get more and more complex and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatized until out the top,</v>

564
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.270
<v Speaker 1>which is where your consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

565
00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.060
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to program what you're doing,</v>

566
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:27.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to pay very careful </v>

567
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.480
<v Speaker 1>attention to how to go about doing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't have the systems built</v>

568
00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:30.910
<v Speaker 1>into you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So know what that's like.</v>

569
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:35.911
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to learn something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of energy and you really </v>

570
00:30:35.911 --> 00:30:35.911
<v Speaker 1>have to pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention,</v>

571
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 1>and then once you start to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

572
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things.</v>

573
00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:44.350
<v Speaker 1>What really happens is those things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to think about anymore.</v>

574
00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.050
<v Speaker 1>And thank God for that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

575
00:30:47.051 --> 00:30:52.051
<v Speaker 1>you can't think that much because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty limited capacity process or in </v>

576
00:30:52.051 --> 00:30:54.310
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the programming is quite difficult.</v>

577
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

578
00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.310
<v Speaker 1>so let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see here what I've got.</v>

579
00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what.</v>

580
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you look on the right there,</v>

581
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a little diagram that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical guy or a little table </v>

582
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.370
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's talking about the motor system.</v>

583
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Now the motor system is what allows you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put action and like you're out </v>

584
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:43.530
<v Speaker 1>putting action at all sorts of levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't even realize because you </v>

585
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.841
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that that site is a </v>

586
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:46.841
<v Speaker 1>sensory activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

587
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:50.420
<v Speaker 1>but that there's a very tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between sensory activity in</v>

588
00:31:50.421 --> 00:31:52.070
<v Speaker 1>motor activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

589
00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:57.340
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at a scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you don't know what your </v>

590
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.771
<v Speaker 1>eyes are going like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason they're going like that </v>

591
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:02.951
<v Speaker 1>is because if you held your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely still and you can actually </v>

592
00:32:02.951 --> 00:32:03.790
<v Speaker 1>learn to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hold your eyes absolutely still,</v>

593
00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.050
<v Speaker 1>your visual fade right out and you won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>see anything.</v>

594
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.270
<v Speaker 1>And because of the little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little,</v>

595
00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:13.271
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retinal cells that are picking up the </v>

596
00:32:13.271 --> 00:32:13.271
<v Speaker 1>light get exhausted.</v>

597
00:32:13.271 --> 00:32:15.150
<v Speaker 1>And so then they stopped transmitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason you're zipping</v>

598
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.510
<v Speaker 1>your eyes back and forth is so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

599
00:32:17.511 --> 00:32:21.530
<v Speaker 1>different parts of your I can process </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene and it doesn't get exhausted.</v>

600
00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And plus you're also looking around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

601
00:32:24.321 --> 00:32:29.321
<v Speaker 1>and you're looking at when things move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you direct your attention to that </v>

602
00:32:29.321 --> 00:32:33.131
<v Speaker 1>or if someone makes a gesture and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually kind of using your eyes </v>

603
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:34.030
<v Speaker 1>like tentacles you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

604
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.580
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to check out the,</v>

605
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:40.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the information that's coded in the </v>

606
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:41.150
<v Speaker 1>light even when you're here and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>

607
00:32:41.151 --> 00:32:43.430
<v Speaker 1>There's a fair bit of motor activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with it.</v>

608
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:48.460
<v Speaker 1>You turn your head unconsciously and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of little motor </v>

609
00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.010
<v Speaker 1>actions in your ear that also helps you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tune in.</v>

610
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And so those things are tightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated.</v>

611
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:55.730
<v Speaker 1>But roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the motor output is action.</v>

612
00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.720
<v Speaker 1>And then Swanson shows that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>these layers in the nervous system that </v>

613
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:04.250
<v Speaker 1>go from the spinal cord upward.</v>

614
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:10.030
<v Speaker 1>The first ones are the somatic motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuron pools and the second are </v>

615
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:10.880
<v Speaker 1>locomotor pattern generators in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>

616
00:33:10.881 --> 00:33:15.881
<v Speaker 1>our local motor pattern initiators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the fourth r locomotor pattern </v>

617
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:18.110
<v Speaker 1>controllers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hierarchy.</v>

618
00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:21.580
<v Speaker 1>So the way to kind of lay piaget on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some senses,</v>

619
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:26.590
<v Speaker 1>to think of the somatic motor neuron </v>
<v Speaker 1>pools as simple actions that can be </v>

620
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:33.290
<v Speaker 1>implemented automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the locomotor pattern generator</v>

621
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:38.291
<v Speaker 1>has taken those simple actions and chain</v>
<v Speaker 1>them into relatively more complex </v>

622
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:44.021
<v Speaker 1>melodies of action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So kinetic melodies and then the </v>

623
00:33:44.021 --> 00:33:48.821
<v Speaker 1>locomotor pattern initiator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less decides windows kinetic </v>

624
00:33:48.821 --> 00:33:50.990
<v Speaker 1>melodies should be implemented and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be unconscious.</v>

625
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 1>And then so it's still at that level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain organization.</v>

626
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:57.750
<v Speaker 1>It's still more or less automatic even </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulus response.</v>

627
00:33:57.751 --> 00:34:02.751
<v Speaker 1>There's a way to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go one level higher and </v>

628
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 1>that's where you get the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily use these automated things.</v>

629
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.090
<v Speaker 1>So I can show you an example of how this</v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

630
00:34:08.091 --> 00:34:13.091
<v Speaker 1>So this is called a ballistic movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to take my hand and I'm </v>

631
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:16.520
<v Speaker 1>going to bring it down really fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right towards that itch.</v>

632
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all right.</v>

633
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's very fast movement.</v>

634
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's cool about that</v>

635
00:34:23.901 --> 00:34:28.790
<v Speaker 1>movement is that I don't have time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once that action starts,</v>

636
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.690
<v Speaker 1>it happened so fast that it's done by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time the,</v>

637
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.560
<v Speaker 1>the information about the action </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually gets to my brain.</v>

638
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.740
<v Speaker 1>So I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I let that go,</v>

639
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I can't control it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I basically am doing is </v>

640
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:50.110
<v Speaker 1>disinhibiting the motor control systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are already have established in my </v>

641
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:56.140
<v Speaker 1>psychophysiological being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm disinhibiting one of those and then </v>

642
00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.630
<v Speaker 1>it runs automatically and so that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing all the time when you're,</v>

643
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:03.740
<v Speaker 1>when you're acting in life and it's kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a neat.</v>

644
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a paper a while back with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate student divine who's who,</v>

645
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.660
<v Speaker 1>so he was a pretty break character and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we got invited to do a paper.</v>

646
00:35:11.661 --> 00:35:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I got invited to do a paper on free will</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we were thinking about free will,</v>

647
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very interesting to think about</v>

648
00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 1>freewill in relationship to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies because it sort of goes like</v>

649
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:27.221
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that out there in the future you've </v>

650
00:35:27.221 --> 00:35:31.061
<v Speaker 1>got free will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the future moves towards the </v>

651
00:35:31.061 --> 00:35:31.130
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like.</v>

652
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Once it gets close enough to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

653
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you have to have initiated something </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatic.</v>

654
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.820
<v Speaker 1>That will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I can give you an example.</v>

655
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:43.500
<v Speaker 1>People who play the piano very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look ahead of where they're playing</v>

656
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.150
<v Speaker 1>in the music because they know how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

657
00:35:48.151 --> 00:35:53.151
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they have to do is look ahead so </v>

658
00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:53.640
<v Speaker 1>that the part of them that knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do this gets ready to do it,</v>

659
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 1>and all of you are experts in that way.</v>

660
00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Likely all of those of you who drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're also experts that way because </v>

661
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:01.980
<v Speaker 1>when you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you look?</v>

662
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:07.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're a good driver on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you looked like at least half a second </v>

663
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 1>or a second ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

664
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because 50 feet ahead has already </v>

665
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.910
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

666
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It's too close in time for you to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it.</v>

667
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:20.631
<v Speaker 1>So basically what you're doing is you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the road and then you're </v>

668
00:36:20.631 --> 00:36:24.890
<v Speaker 1>disinhibiting sequences of action that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are the ones that are going to </v>

669
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.120
<v Speaker 1>correspond to what you want to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the road most,</v>

670
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.850
<v Speaker 1>most adequately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you know,</v>

671
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.820
<v Speaker 1>the closer you get to executing one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those motor behaviors,</v>

672
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the more automated automated it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time you manifest the auction,</v>

673
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.270
<v Speaker 1>there's no free will there at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are.</v>

674
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:41.850
<v Speaker 1>You said enough to be released in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

675
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Speaker 1>So I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

676
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 1>this isn't.</v>

677
00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.280
<v Speaker 1>There's no free will in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was in deciding to do it at </v>

678
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:53.751
<v Speaker 1>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and so that's sort of how your auto </v>

679
00:36:53.751 --> 00:36:55.930
<v Speaker 1>automative city meets your freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

680
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.260
<v Speaker 1>gotta think about it as something </v>
<v Speaker 1>extending across time.</v>

681
00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:00.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

682
00:37:00.601 --> 00:37:05.460
<v Speaker 1>so having established that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to get into the,</v>

683
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

684
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:13.130
<v Speaker 1>the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neurological localization a little </v>

685
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.580
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

686
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:18.360
<v Speaker 1>well you collect all these patterns of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and then you automate them into</v>

687
00:37:18.361 --> 00:37:20.520
<v Speaker 1>routines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could give you an example.</v>

688
00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:23.130
<v Speaker 1>So for a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when a child first comes,</v>

689
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.580
<v Speaker 1>when a child is first born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you tap on his cheek,</v>

690
00:37:25.581 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 1>it will go like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a rooting reflex and it will</v>

691
00:37:28.951 --> 00:37:32.910
<v Speaker 1>move its mouth and tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what it's doing roughly speaking,</v>

692
00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:35.360
<v Speaker 1>is searching for a nipple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you just put your finger there,</v>

693
00:37:35.361 --> 00:37:38.040
<v Speaker 1>the clamp onto that and start to suck.</v>

694
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.060
<v Speaker 1>And so the child comes out with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability and I'm not a reflex,</v>

695
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:47.061
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of built into the neurology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when the child starts to </v>

696
00:37:47.061 --> 00:37:48.540
<v Speaker 1>interact with the mother to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfeed,</v>

697
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:53.570
<v Speaker 1>well then that initial reflex has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>modified quite substantially in the </v>

698
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:58.260
<v Speaker 1>context of the relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother because the bear reflex,</v>

699
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.710
<v Speaker 1>it's enough to get the thing going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not enough to make it work.</v>

700
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.970
<v Speaker 1>And so often mothers take a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to learn how to breastfeed.</v>

701
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:11.150
<v Speaker 1>But it's also because the baby is taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fair bit of time to learn how to do </v>

702
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.570
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have to establish the dance that</v>

703
00:38:12.571 --> 00:38:17.571
<v Speaker 1>goes with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's quite cool </v>

704
00:38:17.571 --> 00:38:17.610
<v Speaker 1>about about that dance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

705
00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:22.611
<v Speaker 1>is there's been studies done of </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and non depressed mothers </v>

706
00:38:22.611 --> 00:38:26.450
<v Speaker 1>interacting with their infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take a non depressed </v>

707
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.860
<v Speaker 1>mother interacting with their infant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just film them and then you speed up</v>

708
00:38:28.861 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 1>the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see like the mothers,</v>

709
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.490
<v Speaker 1>the baby reacts and about the rocks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby racks in the mother reacts.</v>

710
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's like a dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

711
00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:38.650
<v Speaker 1>there's this continual flow of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information between the two of them.</v>

712
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 1>And if the babies with a depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

713
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:44.710
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Jerky and discontinuous.</v>

714
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.100
<v Speaker 1>And so if you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see how the,</v>

715
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:53.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dialectical interaction between the </v>

716
00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:54.100
<v Speaker 1>mother and child is building up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child's repertoire of,</v>

717
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:59.080
<v Speaker 1>of complex abilities within a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

718
00:38:59.081 --> 00:38:59.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

719
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I know I told you guys before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking that,</v>

720
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids really get socialized to play with </v>

721
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:08.880
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

722
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.350
<v Speaker 1>between two and four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not exactly true because even</v>

723
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:17.430
<v Speaker 1>the lower level more automated and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>primordial reflex behaviors,</v>

724
00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

725
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.400
<v Speaker 1>like the ones that are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding,</v>

726
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.010
<v Speaker 1>even those developed under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints of a,</v>

727
00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:29.270
<v Speaker 1>of social guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So society is always there right from </v>

728
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.310
<v Speaker 1>the reflex level up.</v>

729
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:35.760
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when kids are between two </v>

730
00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:35.890
<v Speaker 1>and four hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to learn to actually play.</v>

731
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:40.000
<v Speaker 1>They have to learn how to play complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>games with other children.</v>

732
00:39:40.001 --> 00:39:42.090
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a whole that involves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:47.370
<v Speaker 1>communication and negotiation at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal level and also with people their </v>

734
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.670
<v Speaker 1>own age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

735
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.660
<v Speaker 1>it's continuous in some sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discontinuous and in another sense.</v>

736
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

737
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:58.921
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why do you bother streaming all </v>

738
00:39:58.921 --> 00:40:01.291
<v Speaker 1>these things together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while you think about the </v>

739
00:40:01.291 --> 00:40:01.660
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why does the baby bothered to learn</v>

740
00:40:01.661 --> 00:40:02.800
<v Speaker 1>how to breastfeed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

741
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.270
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

742
00:40:04.271 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

743
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:08.980
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't then it doesn't live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

744
00:40:08.981 --> 00:40:10.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a bunch of reasons for that.</v>

745
00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:13.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like one is obviously it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be nourished properly,</v>

746
00:40:13.601 --> 00:40:16.690
<v Speaker 1>although you know there are things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do to substitute for that.</v>

747
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Although still breastfeeding still seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the best thing you can do for your</v>

748
00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:23.300
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you can work around it,</v>

749
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.110
<v Speaker 1>but fundamentally it seems to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best thing that you can do.</v>

750
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.720
<v Speaker 1>But then the babies also learning all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other things,</v>

751
00:40:28.721 --> 00:40:33.721
<v Speaker 1>like it's got skin to skin contact and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's snuggling and it's being comfort </v>

752
00:40:33.721 --> 00:40:35.200
<v Speaker 1>and it's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gazed eye-gaze that it's coding in the</v>

753
00:40:35.201 --> 00:40:40.201
<v Speaker 1>mother's imitating it and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just a lot of things going on </v>

754
00:40:40.201 --> 00:40:43.441
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the child is organizing all that </v>

755
00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:45.250
<v Speaker 1>partly to fulfill a basic biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>

756
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.830
<v Speaker 1>which is post two needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both thirst and hunger,</v>

757
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's also fulfilling gets need for </v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

758
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:55.111
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because children have a circuit for </v>

759
00:40:55.111 --> 00:40:57.751
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say play as part of the </v>

760
00:40:57.751 --> 00:40:58.030
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamental biological need.</v>

761
00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 1>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children have to have his skin to skin </v>

762
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 1>touch.</v>

763
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.990
<v Speaker 1>They'll die without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not optional.</v>

764
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:10.260
<v Speaker 1>You even see that in racks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a rat pop away from its </v>

765
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.190
<v Speaker 1>mother and you feed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't do anything with it,</v>

766
00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:13.350
<v Speaker 1>it just dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

767
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 1>it goes into opiod overdose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

768
00:41:15.761 --> 00:41:18.730
<v Speaker 1>It's gastrointestinal systems shut down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it dies.</v>

769
00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 1>And you can stop that from happening by </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolating it,</v>

770
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.360
<v Speaker 1>feeding it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like massaging it with a </v>

771
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:27.360
<v Speaker 1>pencil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the eraser,</v>

772
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.960
<v Speaker 1>end of a pencil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can keep the rat pup alive.</v>

773
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

774
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Jaak Panksepp was one of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>either discovered that over,</v>

775
00:41:33.471 --> 00:41:38.471
<v Speaker 1>worked on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that work was extended by Tiffany </v>

776
00:41:38.471 --> 00:41:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Fields at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a hospital in Florida.</v>

777
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Some really brilliant work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was looking at Panksepp's work on </v>

778
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.560
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of tactile stimulation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

779
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:48.470
<v Speaker 1>she thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

780
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I bet we could try that with premature </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies because,</v>

781
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies premature.</v>

782
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Couple of things that are problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

783
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:57.380
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the term pregnancy through</v>

784
00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:59.650
<v Speaker 1>and that's when babies lay on fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

785
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:04.660
<v Speaker 1>so they come out and they're sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got some store storage there in </v>

786
00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.570
<v Speaker 1>case things don't get going very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

787
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 1>and they're gaining a lot of weight to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that last period of pregnancy.</v>

788
00:42:08.811 --> 00:42:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So if they come out pretty mature then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really skinny.</v>

789
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.740
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens often is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to lose weight and that's not good</v>

790
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:18.470
<v Speaker 1>because they should be ramping up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight gain really quick.</v>

791
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Like a newborn baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The elk are roads closed in one week,</v>

792
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are there.</v>

793
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:28.040
<v Speaker 1>They're gaining weight quickly to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>premature babies lose weight and you </v>

794
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.030
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to keep them going.</v>

795
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.790
<v Speaker 1>They put them in an incubator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feed them.</v>

796
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.960
<v Speaker 1>But what tiffany field did was she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nurses go in there,</v>

797
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

798
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.250
<v Speaker 1>with gloves and massage the babies for </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes,</v>

799
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:45.251
<v Speaker 1>three times a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those babies gained weight as fast </v>

800
00:42:45.251 --> 00:42:48.521
<v Speaker 1>as babies that were still in utero and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could still detect the differences </v>

801
00:42:48.521 --> 00:42:49.190
<v Speaker 1>in their development six months later.</v>

802
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Which in baby terms is like forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

803
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean you change as much from zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>months to six months as you probably do </v>

804
00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.660
<v Speaker 1>from six months to 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a radical transformation.</v>

805
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.370
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

806
00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:06.371
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm telling you all this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you lay out these hierarchies of</v>

807
00:43:06.561 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 1>behavior that are well-practiced and </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatized brought under the control of</v>

808
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:13.850
<v Speaker 1>social conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you really do them in the service of</v>

809
00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:19.180
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the question in the service </v>

810
00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:23.261
<v Speaker 1>of we'll say biological necessity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sake of argument while you have to </v>

811
00:43:23.261 --> 00:43:24.310
<v Speaker 1>eat and you have to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the ways,</v>

812
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:29.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons you lay out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy that's associated with </v>

813
00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:30.560
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding is so you can do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly,</v>

814
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:36.370
<v Speaker 1>but also so that you can establish a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship so that not only are you </v>

815
00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:39.881
<v Speaker 1>doing it directly this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also going to do it tomorrow </v>

816
00:43:39.881 --> 00:43:41.330
<v Speaker 1>and the next day and the day after that.</v>

817
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And so the hunger system is integrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these other systems have a </v>

818
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.981
<v Speaker 1>biological constraint in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to come up with an </v>

819
00:43:51.171 --> 00:43:56.171
<v Speaker 1>answer to the continual problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have dedicated biological systems</v>

820
00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:02.200
<v Speaker 1>that help you address problems that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with your biological nature </v>

821
00:44:02.331 --> 00:44:05.410
<v Speaker 1>that are universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those would be the things that Freud</v>

822
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.710
<v Speaker 1>would describe as the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can think of these hierarchies of</v>

823
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:14.711
<v Speaker 1>motor behavior which sort of develop up </v>
<v Speaker 1>into sub personalities as nested in some</v>

824
00:44:15.801 --> 00:44:20.801
<v Speaker 1>sense inside motivational states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the motor behavior hierarchy </v>

825
00:44:22.431 --> 00:44:27.431
<v Speaker 1>that you use when you're angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a motor behavior hierarchy you </v>

826
00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 1>use when you're distressed and kids get </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at that,</v>

827
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'll cry,</v>

828
00:44:30.291 --> 00:44:33.990
<v Speaker 1>which is reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the time they're about to,</v>

829
00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:36.620
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty damn good at crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

830
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:41.630
<v Speaker 1>they've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got a cry that sounds like </v>

831
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.630
<v Speaker 1>they're sad and upset when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really angry.</v>

832
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:45.030
<v Speaker 1>And so if you really listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear the difference because baby</v>

833
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:47.520
<v Speaker 1>angry baby sounds different than a sad </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

834
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:50.440
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby will have you think.</v>

835
00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:51.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

836
00:44:51.991 --> 00:44:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll feel sorry for it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

837
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.450
<v Speaker 1>help it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

838
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:59.451
<v Speaker 1>it's just thinking up years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know this partly because.</v>

839
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.330
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you've got a baby and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>under nine months,</v>

840
00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.470
<v Speaker 1>six months old and it's crying and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>crip.</v>

841
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:05.940
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

842
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.250
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go in there and you pick up the baby and</v>

843
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:13.520
<v Speaker 1>you're comforted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you probably do that pretty much </v>

844
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:13.520
<v Speaker 1>nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the babies that young,</v>

845
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're so young,</v>

846
00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:16.500
<v Speaker 1>they should really still be in utero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really young.</v>

847
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.530
<v Speaker 1>But by nine months that may be starting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get smart.</v>

848
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:24.950
<v Speaker 1>And so it's about nine months when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can visually recognize people he knows </v>

849
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:25.790
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people,</v>

850
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.510
<v Speaker 1>people here she doesn't know.</v>

851
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:30.410
<v Speaker 1>And so then the babies in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

852
00:45:30.411 --> 00:45:35.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squawking a bit and so wants some </v>

853
00:45:35.411 --> 00:45:38.031
<v Speaker 1>attention and then someone walks in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the mother and the baby bursts </v>

854
00:45:38.031 --> 00:45:38.160
<v Speaker 1>into tears and people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

855
00:45:38.161 --> 00:45:40.470
<v Speaker 1>that baby's all sad because it's mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't show up.</v>

856
00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:45.471
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really irritated that the wrong </v>

857
00:45:45.471 --> 00:45:48.831
<v Speaker 1>person showed up and you can tell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people have done facial coding </v>

858
00:45:48.831 --> 00:45:53.031
<v Speaker 1>of the baby's expression and also with </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin tone and an angry baby looks angry </v>

859
00:45:53.031 --> 00:45:57.861
<v Speaker 1>first of all and it turns all red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's really angry and you see </v>

860
00:45:57.861 --> 00:46:01.881
<v Speaker 1>that behavior later too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And temper tantrums like a two year old </v>

861
00:46:01.881 --> 00:46:04.380
<v Speaker 1>is having a temper tantrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just having a fit of rage.</v>

862
00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 1>The rage system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is a rage system,</v>

863
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:13.460
<v Speaker 1>is just completely out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just absolutely dominating their </v>

864
00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.911
<v Speaker 1>behavior and you don't really want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage that because the rage system </v>

865
00:46:16.911 --> 00:46:21.591
<v Speaker 1>should start to be modulated by other </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and other higher order control </v>

866
00:46:21.591 --> 00:46:21.591
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

867
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Not so much suppressed or repressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of how the Freudians with </v>

868
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:30.190
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but integrated into more complex and </v>

869
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:31.860
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated modes of action so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>child can use its anger,</v>

870
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:34.980
<v Speaker 1>which is an extraordinary and useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity,</v>

871
00:46:34.981 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it allows you to defend yourself</v>

872
00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:41.930
<v Speaker 1>so the child can learn to use that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated way so that it can solve </v>

873
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:45.810
<v Speaker 1>the problems that would lead to a range </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack without ever getting to the point</v>

874
00:46:45.811 --> 00:46:47.600
<v Speaker 1>where it has to be enraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

875
00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:50.250
<v Speaker 1>That's a functional child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's learned to repress,</v>

876
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:55.251
<v Speaker 1>it's anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that it gets along with </v>

877
00:46:55.251 --> 00:46:55.251
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never has to get angry.</v>

878
00:46:55.251 --> 00:46:58.050
<v Speaker 1>So now some kids learn to repress their </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger because you know,</v>

879
00:46:58.051 --> 00:47:03.051
<v Speaker 1>they're in a household where any </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of anger is dealt with </v>

880
00:47:03.051 --> 00:47:04.080
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very harshly.</v>

881
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:09.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there's a rule that everyone </v>

882
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.290
<v Speaker 1>has to be nice to each other all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

883
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:13.010
<v Speaker 1>You or else sort of a paradoxical rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

884
00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine now there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these biological systems.</v>

885
00:47:16.081 --> 00:47:20.160
<v Speaker 1>And so I want to show you some of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiation here.</v>

886
00:47:20.161 --> 00:47:25.161
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you get up above the spinal </v>

887
00:47:25.161 --> 00:47:29.571
<v Speaker 1>cord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little brain area I'll show </v>

888
00:47:29.571 --> 00:47:31.120
<v Speaker 1>you about how big it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

889
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:35.800
<v Speaker 1>So there's your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the top one part of the part on top.</v>

890
00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:41.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the cerebral cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the part that people are really </v>

891
00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:41.010
<v Speaker 1>proud of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

892
00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at our cerebral cortex,</v>

893
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:44.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a lot of neurons.</v>

894
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:49.111
<v Speaker 1>And then in the middle there there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>older brain areas of genetically old and</v>

895
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:52.210
<v Speaker 1>then as you go down towards the spinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cord,</v>

896
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:54.160
<v Speaker 1>they basically get older and older and </v>
<v Speaker 1>older and older.</v>

897
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:59.230
<v Speaker 1>So and more and more critical to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

898
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:04.230
<v Speaker 1>So the serotonin system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about it a little bit in </v>

899
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.230
<v Speaker 1>lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

900
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin system is the thing that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of determines where a lobster is in the </v>

901
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.600
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy determines whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it stands like this or whether it stands</v>

902
00:48:10.601 --> 00:48:12.760
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an old system.</v>

903
00:48:12.761 --> 00:48:15.010
<v Speaker 1>And when your brain is developing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Utero,</v>

904
00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 1>this serotonin system that guides its </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

905
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:23.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's how important it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like the conductor of the </v>

906
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.101
<v Speaker 1>orchestra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the thing that controls </v>

907
00:48:26.101 --> 00:48:28.120
<v Speaker 1>the entire unfolding of the brain and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from,</v>

908
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

909
00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>

910
00:48:30.581 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 1>really archaic system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense you're,</v>

911
00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:39.350
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being is controlled by these </v>

912
00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:39.350
<v Speaker 1>things that are ancient beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehension,</v>

913
00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:41.050
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

914
00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:42.370
<v Speaker 1>you look at the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

915
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:43.720
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not very big,</v>

916
00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.580
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

917
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:49.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you take a cat and you.</v>

918
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:51.520
<v Speaker 1>So cat bring looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

919
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.880
<v Speaker 1>if you take off all the stuff that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>light orange and most of the top of the </v>

920
00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.300
<v Speaker 1>stuff above the hypothalamus that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>

921
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:02.680
<v Speaker 1>just take all that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a female cat and it's in a cage.</v>

922
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.710
<v Speaker 1>You really can't tell the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Ada and the cap that has all the</v>

923
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.070
<v Speaker 1>rest of that brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's some things that can't do.</v>

924
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:14.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't do very well if you take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a new situation because he can't </v>

925
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.350
<v Speaker 1>learn more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More importantly,</v>

926
00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.230
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't remember.</v>

927
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's in a perpetual state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything happening for the very first </v>

928
00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.941
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still capable of a lot of the </v>

929
00:49:26.941 --> 00:49:29.431
<v Speaker 1>reactions that would be necessary in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order for you to stay alive so it can </v>

930
00:49:29.431 --> 00:49:30.670
<v Speaker 1>regulate its liquid intake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can regulate its food intake,</v>

931
00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.660
<v Speaker 1>it can react sexually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's capable of defensive aggression,</v>

932
00:49:34.661 --> 00:49:36.460
<v Speaker 1>although it'll really fly into a rage.</v>

933
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:40.030
<v Speaker 1>And so it's Kinda like a disinhibited </v>
<v Speaker 1>two year old in some sense,</v>

934
00:49:40.031 --> 00:49:41.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

935
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:47.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you keep it in the cage and </v>

936
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:47.130
<v Speaker 1>provide it with food and water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the way it lives.</v>

937
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:52.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's hyper exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is just weird beyond </v>

938
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.741
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you take the brain off a cat </v>

939
00:49:55.741 --> 00:49:56.290
<v Speaker 1>and then all it wants to do is explore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not what you think at all.</v>

940
00:49:56.291 --> 00:49:59.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cat with no brain is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>curious.</v>

941
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:03.190
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it does actually because the systems</v>

942
00:50:03.191 --> 00:50:08.191
<v Speaker 1>that drive your exploratory urge are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooted in the hypothalamus and they're </v>

943
00:50:08.531 --> 00:50:10.960
<v Speaker 1>actually the same systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

944
00:50:10.961 --> 00:50:15.961
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a individual differences in the </v>

945
00:50:15.961 --> 00:50:17.980
<v Speaker 1>function and sensitivity of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that are in part associated with</v>

946
00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:22.981
<v Speaker 1>individual differences in extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so extroverts sort of hyper exploratory </v>

947
00:50:22.981 --> 00:50:24.970
<v Speaker 1>in social situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas introverts aren't.</v>

948
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And the exploratory circuit that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has its origins in the hypothalamus</v>

949
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 1>runs on dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

950
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 1>and then it runs through the base of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain and then up into your,</v>

951
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 1>up into your prefrontal cortex in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>

952
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:43.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's also the system that responds </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cocaine and amphetamines and other </v>

953
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.400
<v Speaker 1>drugs that people like to take because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they heightened positive emotion.</v>

954
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:49.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's very ability at a very,</v>

955
00:50:49.851 --> 00:50:54.851
<v Speaker 1>very low level in the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>determines things like the differences </v>

956
00:50:54.851 --> 00:50:57.490
<v Speaker 1>in extroverts and introverts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

957
00:50:57.491 --> 00:51:00.110
<v Speaker 1>it's this tiny little part of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

958
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:02.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's all you have,</v>

959
00:51:02.691 --> 00:51:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you can get along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not too bad.</v>

960
00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

961
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:10.100
<v Speaker 1>but that's also because it's tiny from </v>
<v Speaker 1>one level of analysis,</v>

962
00:51:10.101 --> 00:51:12.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's really big from another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

963
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can increase your resolution when </v>

964
00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:21.500
<v Speaker 1>you're doing brain analysis all the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the molecular level and still be</v>

965
00:51:21.501 --> 00:51:23.220
<v Speaker 1>looking at the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

966
00:51:23.221 --> 00:51:26.000
<v Speaker 1>below them amount like you level at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atomic level.</v>

967
00:51:26.001 --> 00:51:26.720
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

968
00:51:26.721 --> 00:51:31.721
<v Speaker 1>everything's made out of atoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the brain is already there at a </v>

969
00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:35.681
<v Speaker 1>molecular level and it's insanely </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated at the molecular level and </v>

970
00:51:35.681 --> 00:51:37.910
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus is way bigger than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecule.</v>

971
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And so even though it's small compared </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the rest of our brain,</v>

972
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:45.200
<v Speaker 1>it's still a whopping big structured by </v>
<v Speaker 1>atomic standards.</v>

973
00:51:45.201 --> 00:51:47.090
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a hell of a lot going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>

974
00:51:47.091 --> 00:51:49.220
<v Speaker 1>And you notice the Hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

975
00:51:49.221 --> 00:51:50.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there such a.</v>

976
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there such a thing as the ID?</v>

977
00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

978
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.240
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

979
00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Is it in the brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no.</v>

980
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 1>It's really low resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of what's in the brain.</v>

981
00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:05.870
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you might say,</v>

982
00:52:05.871 --> 00:52:07.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a hypothalamus?</v>

983
00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.050
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

984
00:52:09.051 --> 00:52:14.051
<v Speaker 1>yes and no because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic structure and you see it's </v>

985
00:52:14.051 --> 00:52:14.960
<v Speaker 1>made out of a bunch of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

986
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:16.430
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

987
00:52:16.431 --> 00:52:18.470
<v Speaker 1>should you even group those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>

988
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is,</v>

989
00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.220
<v Speaker 1>it depends on why you're grouping them </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

990
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:27.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's useful for some purpose of </v>

991
00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:27.770
<v Speaker 1>understanding or control to group them </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

992
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

993
00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:34.560
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are similar in the way that they </v>

994
00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.791
<v Speaker 1>emerge in the course of brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and they're roughly of the </v>

995
00:52:36.791 --> 00:52:39.581
<v Speaker 1>same phylogenetic age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's lots of reasons to treat </v>

996
00:52:39.581 --> 00:52:43.001
<v Speaker 1>them as the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of reasons to treat </v>

997
00:52:43.001 --> 00:52:45.131
<v Speaker 1>them as different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what you're trying to do </v>

998
00:52:45.131 --> 00:52:45.920
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamus has all these little</v>

999
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:52.470
<v Speaker 2>sub what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you call</v>

1000
00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:57.840
<v Speaker 1>sub structures that are really in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that the core of the sub </v>

1001
00:52:57.981 --> 00:53:01.390
<v Speaker 1>personalities that we talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1002
00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:02.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1003
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:08.690
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is,</v>

1004
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:13.750
<v Speaker 1>this is Swanson again and he's showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you this is a rat's brain from the </v>

1005
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:16.850
<v Speaker 1>bottom and he's showing you the layout </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the hypothalamus.</v>

1006
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:19.020
<v Speaker 1>You see it's got all those different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1007
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.190
<v Speaker 1>nuclei doesn't look like one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a bunch of things.</v>

1008
00:53:22.191 --> 00:53:27.191
<v Speaker 1>And so here he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the descending paraventricular nucleus </v>

1009
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:32.190
<v Speaker 1>is involved in the control of eating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking and that's shown in green.</v>

1010
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing that when you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry or thirsty,</v>

1011
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that's sort of turns on</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hungry and thirsty,</v>

1012
00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:44.370
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the rest of the cell groups </v>

1013
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:48.141
<v Speaker 1>play a major role in controlling two </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes of social behaviors that his is </v>

1014
00:53:48.141 --> 00:53:52.370
<v Speaker 1>involving interactions between animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive as the red areas and </v>

1015
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:54.840
<v Speaker 1>defensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purplish areas.</v>

1016
00:53:55.650 --> 00:54:00.650
<v Speaker 1>So now what you can think is you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those little sub routines that were </v>

1017
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.780
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1018
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:02.940
<v Speaker 1>that are sort of at hand and ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1019
00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And then they're organized underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>these major classes of motivation so </v>

1020
00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:12.480
<v Speaker 1>that you have to do something like eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

1021
00:54:12.481 --> 00:54:17.481
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's an eating robot in </v>

1022
00:54:17.481 --> 00:54:17.481
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it,</v>

1023
00:54:17.481 --> 00:54:19.260
<v Speaker 1>except it's smarter than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's alive and conscious.</v>

1024
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are alive.</v>

1025
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.920
<v Speaker 1>They're not machines and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>deterministic.</v>

1026
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:28.670
<v Speaker 1>They're just subbed there partial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can pick them as low resolution </v>

1027
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.040
<v Speaker 1>personalities or unit dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities because the only thing the</v>

1028
00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:36.041
<v Speaker 1>eating system really cares about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you eat and the drinking </v>

1029
00:54:36.041 --> 00:54:39.261
<v Speaker 1>system is the same thing you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see malfunctioned sometimes in people </v>

1030
00:54:39.261 --> 00:54:41.970
<v Speaker 1>have these singular system so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop a condition.</v>

1031
00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:46.140
<v Speaker 1>If you have hypothalamic damage where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you you'll drink yourself,</v>

1032
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you'll drink water until you die and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one can stop you.</v>

1033
00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:52.410
<v Speaker 1>You know they could lock you in a room </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from sinks and that would stop you,</v>

1034
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:57.710
<v Speaker 1>but you'd be raging away inside trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to claw through the door to get to the </v>

1035
00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:01.071
<v Speaker 1>damn water because you're so hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirsty that it's all that there is left</v>

1036
00:55:01.741 --> 00:55:04.530
<v Speaker 1>of you in some sense that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed access to a tap,</v>

1037
00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:09.680
<v Speaker 1>you'll just drink and drink and drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>and drink and drink and drink and drink </v>

1038
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:09.680
<v Speaker 1>until you drown.</v>

1039
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can say,</v>

1040
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had enough water.</v>

1041
00:55:11.611 --> 00:55:12.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget that.</v>

1042
00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:18.240
<v Speaker 1>The hypothalamus is a major league </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and when push comes to shove,</v>

1043
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:23.330
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that's in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways of thinking about </v>

1044
00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:27.021
<v Speaker 1>the way that you organize your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life is that the hypothalamus </v>

1045
00:55:27.021 --> 00:55:30.030
<v Speaker 1>controls the major motivational systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just talked about those.</v>

1046
00:55:30.031 --> 00:55:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And so those are the things that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would think about as drives,</v>

1047
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.670
<v Speaker 1>although they're not driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're too complicated to be drives.</v>

1048
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:39.510
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other systems that come</v>
<v Speaker 1>up later that we'll also talk about that</v>

1049
00:55:39.511 --> 00:55:44.511
<v Speaker 1>or eat that governed emotion like </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and a and a different system </v>

1050
00:55:44.731 --> 00:55:49.731
<v Speaker 1>that governs pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly what you're trying to do as you </v>

1051
00:55:49.731 --> 00:55:51.180
<v Speaker 1>organize your life is to make sure those</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems stay shut off.</v>

1052
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.800
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1053
00:55:52.801 --> 00:55:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1054
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:54.990
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

1055
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:59.520
<v Speaker 1>You're just satisfied all of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could take control from you.</v>

1056
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And so now you have a modicum of choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

1057
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And basically what you're doing when all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these things have had,</v>

1058
00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:06.680
<v Speaker 1>what they need is you're running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring,</v>

1059
00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1060
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:13.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also another one of these </v>

1061
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.390
<v Speaker 1>circuits because the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I already said,</v>

1062
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.830
<v Speaker 1>governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration.</v>

1063
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:19.340
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of see all psychologists often </v>
<v Speaker 1>get things backwards and they ask silly </v>

1064
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:26.050
<v Speaker 1>like why are people anxious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid question.</v>

1065
00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It's how people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are people ever calm?</v>

1066
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a question because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you anxious?</v>

1067
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of all the terrible things that </v>

1068
00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 1>can happen to you and they will happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you even worse.</v>

1069
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.730
<v Speaker 1>And there isn't anything you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1070
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:44.731
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you quaking in your boots </v>

1071
00:56:44.731 --> 00:56:44.731
<v Speaker 1>just sitting there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a mystery,</v>

1072
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1073
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1074
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.710
<v Speaker 1>here you are in your normal state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1075
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.780
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a normal state.</v>

1076
00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:58.110
<v Speaker 1>People have been trying for 7 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>years like as people to create a </v>

1077
00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:06.090
<v Speaker 1>situation so complex and comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a couple hundred of you can sit </v>

1078
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:06.790
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1079
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:11.850
<v Speaker 1>without having your hypothalamus driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>you towards something and actually just </v>

1080
00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:14.440
<v Speaker 1>listened to something for a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not normal.</v>

1081
00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:18.010
<v Speaker 1>That's so staggeringly abnormal that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

1082
00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:21.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a miracle that the typical person </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1083
00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And for most of human history it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were hungry man.</v>

1084
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:31.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the same like you people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some of you have probably been </v>

1085
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.570
<v Speaker 1>hungry in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1086
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.560
<v Speaker 1>what's the longest and is there someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>here who's going without food for more </v>

1087
00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.050
<v Speaker 1>than one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1088
00:57:38.051 --> 00:57:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Has anybody here going without food for </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a week.</v>

1089
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1090
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:44.950
<v Speaker 1>How about three days?</v>

1091
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like are you hungry?</v>

1092
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.450
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1093
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:55.550
<v Speaker 1>You're hungry when you haven't had </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to eat for 20 days then you're </v>

1094
00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:55.550
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1095
00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:59.451
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same goes for thirst and cold </v>

1096
00:57:59.451 --> 00:58:00.540
<v Speaker 1>and all the things that were just never </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed to.</v>

1097
00:58:00.541 --> 00:58:05.541
<v Speaker 1>So we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think civilized people are all calm </v>

1098
00:58:05.541 --> 00:58:05.541
<v Speaker 1>and nice and easy to get along with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1099
00:58:05.541 --> 00:58:06.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

1100
00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.010
<v Speaker 1>you have absolutely everything you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1101
00:58:11.011 --> 00:58:16.011
<v Speaker 1>So that makes you as easy to get along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with is any completely insane primate </v>

1102
00:58:16.011 --> 00:58:17.070
<v Speaker 1>ever get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1103
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the rep,</v>

1104
00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:21.810
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well God,</v>

1105
00:58:21.811 --> 00:58:23.730
<v Speaker 1>if you can survive with just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>

1106
00:58:23.731 --> 00:58:27.120
<v Speaker 1>what is the rest of the brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their answer is,</v>

1107
00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:32.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're thirsty,</v>

1108
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're angry.</v>

1109
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:37.270
<v Speaker 1>100 system isn't going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of that.</v>

1110
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're hungry.</v>

1111
00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That works,</v>

1112
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:41.770
<v Speaker 1>you're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works,</v>

1113
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:45.670
<v Speaker 1>but then you have another problem which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're hungry now when you're angry.</v>

1114
00:58:45.671 --> 00:58:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Now perhaps you can move through those </v>
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>

1115
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:52.060
<v Speaker 1>You watch that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that in two year olds.</v>

1116
00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:53.920
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why they're so fun to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1117
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:55.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1118
00:58:55.181 --> 00:59:00.181
<v Speaker 1>they're really excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're running around playing and then </v>

1119
00:59:00.181 --> 00:59:02.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they trip and then they're crying like </v>

1120
00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:04.351
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you poke them and they laugh </v>

1121
00:59:04.351 --> 00:59:04.400
<v Speaker 1>and then they want something to eat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they fall asleep and you know,</v>

1122
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.220
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just running.</v>

1123
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:11.250
<v Speaker 1>They're run by their hypothalamus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun to see because they're </v>

1124
00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:12.190
<v Speaker 1>so alive and so enthusiastic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous,</v>

1125
00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:17.490
<v Speaker 1>but they're completely clueless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you take one who throws his </v>

1126
00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:18.040
<v Speaker 1>creatures to the mall and leave it there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

1127
00:59:18.041 --> 00:59:20.890
<v Speaker 1>it's just not happy at all and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for that,</v>

1128
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:27.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't know how to sequence any of </v>

1129
00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:27.370
<v Speaker 1>its actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1130
00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It runs through these states of ne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't complicated enough to </v>

1131
00:59:30.561 --> 00:59:35.561
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to address those needs in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any consistent sense across multiple </v>

1132
00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a social world.</v>

1133
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:43.210
<v Speaker 1>You need the rest of your brain for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so and that again fits in with the </v>

1134
00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Piagetian idea is that what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you're taking these micro </v>

1135
00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.970
<v Speaker 1>personalities that are basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiated within the hypothalamus and</v>

1136
00:59:49.971 --> 00:59:54.971
<v Speaker 1>then you're organizing those into more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more complex games and you need the </v>

1137
00:59:54.971 --> 00:59:59.051
<v Speaker 1>cortex to do that because the cortex is </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly what enables you just to think </v>

1138
00:59:59.051 --> 01:00:01.310
<v Speaker 1>about time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1139
01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:06.400
<v Speaker 1>because the hypothalamus is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all right here and now thing like </v>

1140
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamic cat lives in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>

1141
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>There's that president and now see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1142
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you probably get some sense of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there are one of the things that </v>

1143
01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.841
<v Speaker 1>happens to people if they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfettered means or if they take </v>

1144
01:00:19.841 --> 01:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that some of the inhibitory control.</v>

1145
01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are complex control systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are critical shutdown and so then </v>

1146
01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:32.141
<v Speaker 1>they enter a state where it's all now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know the now just comes at </v>

1147
01:00:33.051 --> 01:00:35.810
<v Speaker 1>people in that state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a transcendent experience.</v>

1148
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:39.590
<v Speaker 1>But of course you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fight that you're not functional.</v>

1149
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense you trade that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcended relationship with reality </v>

1150
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>for a narrow functionality and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>too bad,</v>

1151
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:49.250
<v Speaker 1>that's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1152
01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1153
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a tradeoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1154
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:57.101
<v Speaker 1>you're organizing these sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities and you're using your </v>

1155
01:00:57.101 --> 01:01:00.731
<v Speaker 1>cortex to do that because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't just have to think about </v>

1156
01:01:00.731 --> 01:01:03.911
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think about how am I going </v>

1157
01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>to get the food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when is the food going to come,</v>

1158
01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:09.610
<v Speaker 1>how am I going to cook the food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about all the other people that </v>

1159
01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>want to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we regulate that in our family?</v>

1160
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:15.370
<v Speaker 1>And then how do we regulate that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we also need to sleep and </v>

1161
01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:18.431
<v Speaker 1>we need to work and we need to get along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people and we need to have </v>

1162
01:01:18.431 --> 01:01:21.131
<v Speaker 1>something interesting to do and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculously complicated and it </v>

1163
01:01:21.131 --> 01:01:26.021
<v Speaker 1>really doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no end to the complication </v>

1164
01:01:26.021 --> 01:01:26.021
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

1165
01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're just solving the problem </v>

1166
01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.961
<v Speaker 1>for you then too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you're trying to work it out </v>

1167
01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:36.801
<v Speaker 1>within your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then that sort of like the chrome </v>

1168
01:01:36.801 --> 01:01:39.501
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never get out of their family </v>

1169
01:01:39.501 --> 01:01:41.061
<v Speaker 1>because they just never come to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrangement that works well enough so </v>

1170
01:01:41.061 --> 01:01:41.061
<v Speaker 1>that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1171
01:01:41.061 --> 01:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>in some sense move into the broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1172
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Then you solve the family problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you've got the,</v>

1173
01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>like the tribe problem and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can solve that to some degree,</v>

1174
01:01:48.811 --> 01:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>but then you have the broader political </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

1175
01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1176
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that crop up for you to solve,</v>

1177
01:01:55.651 --> 01:02:00.651
<v Speaker 1>so there's plenty for you to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your big cortex and when we paid a big </v>

1178
01:02:00.651 --> 01:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>price for that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because once we discovered time,</v>

1179
01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:04.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1180
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.800
<v Speaker 1>we could make a bargain with the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically what you do when you </v>

1181
01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>regulate your behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making a bargain with the future.</v>

1182
01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:18.460
<v Speaker 1>You say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I forego so and so now than later,</v>

1183
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll pay off.</v>

1184
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's real useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can conceptualize the future and you</v>

1185
01:02:24.631 --> 01:02:27.390
<v Speaker 1>can conceptualize the future as </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you can bargain with,</v>

1186
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>but there's a cost to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is you can't,</v>

1187
01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to do just what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

1188
01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:37.180
<v Speaker 1>and of course that sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why people drink alcohol </v>

1189
01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:41.140
<v Speaker 1>because alcohol is disinhibiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stops you from thinking it actually </v>

1190
01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:45.291
<v Speaker 1>doesn't stop you from thinking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future by the way it stops you from </v>

1191
01:02:45.291 --> 01:02:49.100
<v Speaker 1>caring about what you think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future and that's just as good and so </v>

1192
01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:53.871
<v Speaker 1>then you could go out and have fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>because fun is impulsive and often </v>

1193
01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:57.411
<v Speaker 1>extremely dangerous because the longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences can be really devastating,</v>

1194
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's a real pain to keep yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled all the time,</v>

1195
01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:06.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're foregoing direct reward </v>

1196
01:03:06.021 --> 01:03:06.500
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

1197
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:11.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's part of the reason why </v>

1198
01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:13.320
<v Speaker 1>people in heavily industrialized complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries aren't necessarily happy.</v>

1199
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1200
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.860
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot out grinding away to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the machinery that keeps all of this</v>

1201
01:03:19.861 --> 01:03:21.390
<v Speaker 1>in place going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1202
01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:25.380
<v Speaker 1>so you're not getting typhoid and know </v>
<v Speaker 1>tigers aren't tearing you apart.</v>

1203
01:03:25.381 --> 01:03:30.381
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be unbelievably disciplined </v>

1204
01:03:30.381 --> 01:03:34.640
<v Speaker 1>and ready to act constantly to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's so complex around you </v>

1205
01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.600
<v Speaker 1>work it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not necessarily fun.</v>

1206
01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:39.480
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1207
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.720
<v Speaker 1>now let's look at something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can tell me if I took,</v>

1208
01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.640
<v Speaker 1>if I showed you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I didn't show you this.</v>

1209
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.020
<v Speaker 1>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1210
01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:09.021
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some of you know this and so you </v>

1211
01:04:09.021 --> 01:04:11.781
<v Speaker 1>just don't say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you probably don't know this </v>

1212
01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.370
<v Speaker 1>specific version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're gonna if you've seen this sort</v>

1213
01:04:14.371 --> 01:04:16.020
<v Speaker 1>of thing before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to think you're smart while</v>

1214
01:04:16.021 --> 01:04:19.470
<v Speaker 1>you're watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll probably still trip you up.</v>

1215
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me a sec here at all.</v>

1216
01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.190
<v Speaker 1>See if we can actually get some sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of this thing.</v>

1217
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:40.210
<v Speaker 2>The monkey business count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many times the players wearing white</v>

1218
01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:41.990
<v Speaker 2>pass the ball?</v>

1219
01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>The correct answer is 16.</v>

1220
01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Did you spot the gorilla for people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't seen or heard about a video like</v>

1221
01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:28.780
<v Speaker 2>this before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>About half miss the gorilla.</v>

1222
01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:34.440
<v Speaker 2>If you knew about the gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably saw it,</v>

1223
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.800
<v Speaker 2>but did you notice the curtain changing </v>
<v Speaker 2>color or the player on the black team </v>

1224
01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:39.800
<v Speaker 2>leaving the game?</v>

1225
01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Here comes the gorilla and there goes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>player and the curtain is changing from </v>

1226
01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>red to gold.</v>

1227
01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.320
<v Speaker 2>What you're looking for a gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monkey learn more about this </v>

1228
01:06:10.991 --> 01:06:15.250
<v Speaker 2>illusion and the original gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiment@invisiblegorilla.com.</v>

1229
01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's quite a.</v>

1230
01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:28.640
<v Speaker 1>that's quite illustration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the questions you might ask </v>

1231
01:06:30.301 --> 01:06:31.470
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1232
01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.280
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1233
01:06:32.281 --> 01:06:35.970
<v Speaker 1>how many of you didn't see the gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1234
01:06:35.971 --> 01:06:38.280
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have seen this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>video before?</v>

1235
01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you knew about the damn grill of the </v>

1236
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>people who didn't know about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla.</v>

1237
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:47.070
<v Speaker 1>How many people didn't see the gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1238
01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you got the other things?</v>

1239
01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1240
01:06:53.550 --> 01:06:55.170
<v Speaker 1>so you get the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

1241
01:06:55.171 --> 01:06:58.290
<v Speaker 1>and it's brilliant instrument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an insanely brilliant experiment.</v>

1242
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:06.130
<v Speaker 1>You're blind to a ridiculous degree and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your visual system and your brain are </v>

1243
01:07:08.371 --> 01:07:10.530
<v Speaker 1>constantly coping with the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're blind.</v>

1244
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:13.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can kind of detective to some</v>

1245
01:07:13.261 --> 01:07:18.261
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you look at someone but you pay </v>

1246
01:07:18.261 --> 01:07:18.261
<v Speaker 1>attention to the things that surround </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1247
01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.520
<v Speaker 1>You'll see that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm looking at you.</v>

1248
01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:24.150
<v Speaker 1>I can't see your nose for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>

1249
01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't see your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see your glasses.</v>

1250
01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any features in your face </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

1251
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Can you smile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one behind so.</v>

1252
01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've noticed when </v>

1253
01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:42.140
<v Speaker 1>doing this is that like if you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1254
01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.070
<v Speaker 1>look at my finger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pay attention to my face.</v>

1255
01:07:44.071 --> 01:07:45.990
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard because normally when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay attention,</v>

1256
01:07:45.991 --> 01:07:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you move your eyes to what you're paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>

1257
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what you might say.</v>

1258
01:07:50.741 --> 01:07:52.980
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you might see is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't see my nose.</v>

1259
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:57.240
<v Speaker 1>The second thing you might see is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can really see my eyes,</v>

1260
01:07:57.241 --> 01:07:58.240
<v Speaker 1>especially if they moved.</v>

1261
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

1262
01:08:04.671 --> 01:08:06.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden these eyes pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1263
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll try this too.</v>

1264
01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look at my finger again.</v>

1265
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.240
<v Speaker 1>So you can also see teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1266
01:08:17.241 --> 01:08:18.620
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1267
01:08:18.621 --> 01:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking here and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something there with eyes and teeth,</v>

1268
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you should probably be able to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1269
01:08:23.101 --> 01:08:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And so what that basically means is he </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought this tiny little phobia,</v>

1270
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>which is right in the center of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>retina.</v>

1271
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:33.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just densely packed with cells and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then those cells transmit information </v>

1272
01:08:33.771 --> 01:08:38.771
<v Speaker 1>along the optic nerve and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected like mad to cells in the </v>

1273
01:08:38.771 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>visual Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have that much room so you</v>

1274
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>can connect all of the cells in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>retina to 10,000</v>

1275
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:49.181
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at the first level of connection </v>

1276
01:08:49.181 --> 01:08:49.181
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have a brain this big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1277
01:08:49.181 --> 01:08:53.530
<v Speaker 1>and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get by and part of the way you </v>

1278
01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:57.251
<v Speaker 1>get by as you're always moving your eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and so it looks like you can see </v>

1279
01:08:57.251 --> 01:08:57.290
<v Speaker 1>everything but you can't.</v>

1280
01:08:57.830 --> 01:09:02.830
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll hear like if I'm looking at you </v>

1281
01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:02.830
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell them my hands are there.</v>

1282
01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Although if I didn't know they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

1283
01:09:04.281 --> 01:09:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I probably couldn't figure it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are kind of blurry I would say.</v>

1284
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:13.130
<v Speaker 1>And they're in black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't tell that you know,</v>

1285
01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.130
<v Speaker 1>so out here it's like who cares what </v>
<v Speaker 1>color it is?</v>

1286
01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.250
<v Speaker 1>So you just don't see the color but you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know that you don't see the color.</v>

1287
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:22.910
<v Speaker 1>And then of course I can have my hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and then I put them here,</v>

1288
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I can hardly see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're gone.</v>

1289
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:27.530
<v Speaker 1>They're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't even exist.</v>

1290
01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1291
01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:33.551
<v Speaker 1>because you think in some sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what was behind your head would be </v>

1292
01:09:33.551 --> 01:09:34.790
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you close your eyes,</v>

1293
01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:40.330
<v Speaker 1>that's nothing but no one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you can't see behind your head is </v>

1294
01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:40.580
<v Speaker 1>so not there that it isn't.</v>

1295
01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:42.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's literally,</v>

1296
01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:46.780
<v Speaker 1>it isn't even not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all gone.</v>

1297
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:48.200
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1298
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the way that your eyes work </v>

1299
01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.871
<v Speaker 1>is that the periphery is attached to </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices in some sense.</v>

1300
01:09:57.171 --> 01:09:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And some of them detect lines and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them detect movement.</v>

1301
01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:05.170
<v Speaker 1>You remember Jurassic Park don't move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dinosaur can't see you unless you </v>

1302
01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:05.750
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1303
01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:07.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frogs are like that.</v>

1304
01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.920
<v Speaker 1>And cats are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To some degree.</v>

1305
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.950
<v Speaker 1>They can really see things move this way</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the risers slit.</v>

1306
01:10:13.951 --> 01:10:17.090
<v Speaker 1>It makes it easier for them to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>things moving like this.</v>

1307
01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.130
<v Speaker 1>They're not so good at things moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

1308
01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they chase mice,</v>

1309
01:10:20.631 --> 01:10:22.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most mice,</v>

1310
01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:27.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except like ones that they moved this </v>

1311
01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.701
<v Speaker 1>way and so cats are specialized for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're also specialized to see </v>

1312
01:10:30.701 --> 01:10:35.411
<v Speaker 1>teeth and an ice because you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know if something's looking at you and </v>

1313
01:10:35.411 --> 01:10:36.440
<v Speaker 1>you want to know if it has teeth.</v>

1314
01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:41.710
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means in part is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surrounding tissue in your eyes </v>

1315
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.930
<v Speaker 1>reports to some degree to your visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cortex,</v>

1316
01:10:44.931 --> 01:10:48.230
<v Speaker 1>which is what you used to actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious vision with,</v>

1317
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:53.500
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it just dumps down into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the brain areas we haven't </v>

1318
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:56.591
<v Speaker 1>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily directly down to the </v>

1319
01:10:56.591 --> 01:10:59.561
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I suspect it has the inputs </v>

1320
01:10:59.561 --> 01:10:59.561
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>

1321
01:10:59.561 --> 01:11:03.940
<v Speaker 1>But your eyes talk to your spinal cord </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly so that you could see something</v>

1322
01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:05.210
<v Speaker 1>snake light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1323
01:11:05.211 --> 01:11:06.990
<v Speaker 1>in jumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like your.</v>

1324
01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.170
<v Speaker 1>You jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your hand touches a hot stove,</v>

1325
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:14.410
<v Speaker 1>you don't even see the snake snake junk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is you waiting </v>

1326
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:18.831
<v Speaker 1>around to see the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's bitten you 15 times and </v>

1327
01:11:18.831 --> 01:11:18.831
<v Speaker 1>your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't wait around and see this,</v>

1328
01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:20.970
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a snake.</v>

1329
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:22.470
<v Speaker 1>And you jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1330
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:24.120
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work,</v>

1331
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.480
<v Speaker 1>so your body has conserved all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>layers of reflexive movement all the way</v>

1332
01:11:29.791 --> 01:11:34.791
<v Speaker 1>up to a higher order voluntary movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you just wouldn't be </v>

1333
01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:39.291
<v Speaker 1>fast enough when something super fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and then the way your eyes are </v>

1334
01:11:39.291 --> 01:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>built so your eyes can tell your body to</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump if no vision,</v>

1335
01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:42.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1336
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:45.900
<v Speaker 1>It's just pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snake pattern jump pattern,</v>

1337
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>snake pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retinal pattern,</v>

1338
01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.740
<v Speaker 1>optic nerve pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain pattern,</v>

1339
01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.840
<v Speaker 1>muscle pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no vision,</v>

1340
01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:53.180
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1341
01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:58.340
<v Speaker 1>because you don't need to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to do pattern pattern </v>

1342
01:11:58.340 --> 01:11:58.340
<v Speaker 1>matching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1343
01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:02.091
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not much different than the </v>

1344
01:12:02.091 --> 01:12:02.091
<v Speaker 1>touching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1345
01:12:02.091 --> 01:12:06.770
<v Speaker 1>you can feel the pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can build a three dimensional </v>

1346
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:08.010
<v Speaker 1>representation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can really see well with your eyes.</v>

1347
01:12:08.011 --> 01:12:11.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea that blind people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't see as a really dopey idea.</v>

1348
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:16.370
<v Speaker 1>It can't see color and they're not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at detecting things in the </v>

1349
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:16.830
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a visual world.</v>

1350
01:12:16.831 --> 01:12:19.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just built out of things that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have color.</v>

1351
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:24.250
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know perfectly well that that's the </v>

1352
01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 1>case because I could hand you an object </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can fiddle around with it behind</v>

1353
01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:30.141
<v Speaker 1>your back and after some fiddling around</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew exactly what it looked like and </v>

1354
01:12:30.141 --> 01:12:31.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might pull it out here and say,</v>

1355
01:12:31.441 --> 01:12:32.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was blue.</v>

1356
01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:33.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1357
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:34.710
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

1358
01:12:34.711 --> 01:12:39.711
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know it was blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still saw it and you can get </v>

1359
01:12:39.711 --> 01:12:39.990
<v Speaker 1>pretty God damn good vision with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ears.</v>

1360
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:43.230
<v Speaker 1>So there are kids who are blind who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned to echolocate.</v>

1361
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:45.480
<v Speaker 1>So they go click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>

1362
01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:50.700
<v Speaker 1>They don't make that noise exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they do click and they can detect </v>

1363
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.040
<v Speaker 1>the clicks bouncing off of things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do that well enough.</v>

1364
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Not only to walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of them can actually ride </v>

1365
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.070
<v Speaker 1>bikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1366
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's impressive man.</v>

1367
01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:00.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's that?</v>

1368
01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one kid,</v>

1369
01:13:02.491 --> 01:13:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I saw a kid on youtube who was blind who</v>
<v Speaker 1>could shoot baskets.</v>

1370
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is thought,</v>

1371
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:07.870
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's impressive now.</v>

1372
01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.430
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point is,</v>

1373
01:13:09.431 --> 01:13:10.350
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1374
01:13:10.351 --> 01:13:14.280
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the neural tissue is intake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever input it gets.</v>

1375
01:13:14.281 --> 01:13:16.320
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're born blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1376
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:21.360
<v Speaker 1>your auditory systems will invade your </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual system and then you have twice as</v>

1377
01:13:21.361 --> 01:13:22.920
<v Speaker 1>much brain devoted to your hearing.</v>

1378
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.370
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

1379
01:13:24.371 --> 01:13:26.490
<v Speaker 1>you can use that quite effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1380
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think we're probably pretty much </v>

1381
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:34.790
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing I want to tell you before </v>

1382
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:37.011
<v Speaker 1>we go onto the next part though is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we've sort of built up the idea </v>

1383
01:13:37.011 --> 01:13:41.601
<v Speaker 1>of these underlying motivational systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you can kind of see how they </v>

1384
01:13:41.601 --> 01:13:43.380
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say to yourself,</v>

1385
01:13:43.890 --> 01:13:48.890
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you see the gorilla and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>curtain and the person leaving?</v>

1386
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:52.440
<v Speaker 1>It's really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really complicated.</v>

1387
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first answer is you did what I </v>

1388
01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:59.670
<v Speaker 1>asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might ask,</v>

1389
01:13:59.671 --> 01:14:01.860
<v Speaker 1>well why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you do what I asked?</v>

1390
01:14:01.861 --> 01:14:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you miss the damn gorilla,</v>

1391
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:04.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1392
01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.060
<v Speaker 1>obviously that wasn't a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

1393
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:08.760
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why did you do what I asked?</v>

1394
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And the answer would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's sort of like the milgram </v>

1395
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.510
<v Speaker 1>obedience experiment except lower level.</v>

1396
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like we've got an agreement going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on here.</v>

1397
01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:22.630
<v Speaker 1>You guys are all very sophisticated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex game players,</v>

1398
01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you couldn't sit here </v>

1399
01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:28.040
<v Speaker 1>peacefully for an hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're.</v>

1400
01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:32.800
<v Speaker 1>You're very well socialized all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that means that you've organized </v>

1401
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.381
<v Speaker 1>all your motivations into a hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that hierarchy is guiding your </v>

1402
01:14:37.381 --> 01:14:38.680
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it might be something like,</v>

1403
01:14:38.681 --> 01:14:39.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to learn something,</v>

1404
01:14:39.911 --> 01:14:42.490
<v Speaker 1>and hypothetically you've come here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn something,</v>

1405
01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:47.260
<v Speaker 1>and so you're playing that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then because that's the motivational</v>

1406
01:14:47.261 --> 01:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>state that you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I asked you to do something,</v>

1407
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:55.060
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then what's so cool is that as soon</v>

1408
01:14:55.061 --> 01:14:58.390
<v Speaker 1>as you decide to point your attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>out something,</v>

1409
01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:03.160
<v Speaker 1>what happens is what you see in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world radically transforms,</v>

1410
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I say,</v>

1411
01:15:04.841 --> 01:15:09.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>count the basketballs and all of a </v>

1412
01:15:09.841 --> 01:15:09.841
<v Speaker 1>sudden all you can see your basketball.</v>

1413
01:15:09.841 --> 01:15:09.841
<v Speaker 1>So new think no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1414
01:15:09.841 --> 01:15:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I see I'm not blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1415
01:15:10.481 --> 01:15:12.910
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a pretty damn blind.</v>

1416
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:18.270
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly how you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how motivation is a </v>

1417
01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:23.311
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it has its whole sets of </v>

1418
01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:24.180
<v Speaker 1>perceptions and values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of a sudden we,</v>

1419
01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I set you up in a little motivated state</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a complicated,</v>

1420
01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:28.570
<v Speaker 1>why don't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just like,</v>

1421
01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.570
<v Speaker 1>here's the task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're all motivated,</v>

1422
01:15:31.571 --> 01:15:33.620
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do the task properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

1423
01:15:33.650 --> 01:15:37.450
<v Speaker 1>for God only knows how many reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden all that exists</v>

1424
01:15:37.451 --> 01:15:40.000
<v Speaker 1>in the world are basketballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1425
01:15:40.001 --> 01:15:44.220
<v Speaker 1>And so that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it's as if you're,</v>

1426
01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:49.230
<v Speaker 1>your goal directed attention has </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed the phenomenology of the </v>

1427
01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:53.191
<v Speaker 1>world and that's something that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool because one of the things that </v>

1428
01:15:53.191 --> 01:15:56.251
<v Speaker 1>implies is that what you see of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world depends on what you're aiming at </v>

1429
01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.890
<v Speaker 1>and in a real sense that this isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>something trivial sense.</v>

1430
01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:02.650
<v Speaker 1>It means like literally what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming at.</v>

1431
01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to count the basketballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means well,</v>

1432
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:10.470
<v Speaker 1>you're not noticing the gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that you might ask </v>

1433
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:14.131
<v Speaker 1>yourself and this department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the phenomenologists were on about </v>

1434
01:16:14.131 --> 01:16:17.220
<v Speaker 1>is what are you aiming at and what is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what you're aiming at allows you to</v>

1435
01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:21.070
<v Speaker 1>see and what is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're aiming at?</v>

1436
01:16:21.071 --> 01:16:26.071
<v Speaker 1>Blinds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube and it blinds you to a lot more </v>

1437
01:16:26.071 --> 01:16:29.401
<v Speaker 1>than it allows you to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so another thing that you can think </v>

1438
01:16:29.401 --> 01:16:32.521
<v Speaker 1>about is like if everything you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you angry and bitter and </v>

1439
01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:33.460
<v Speaker 1>resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might think,</v>

1440
01:16:33.461 --> 01:16:38.461
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly am I aiming at that's </v>

1441
01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:39.790
<v Speaker 1>making the world organized itself around</v>
<v Speaker 1>me in that manner?</v>

1442
01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1443
01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:46.340
<v Speaker 1>that's very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a complex from a union </v>

1444
01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:46.630
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complex would do that.</v>

1445
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:47.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's a set of values.</v>

1446
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.930
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of economists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they inhabit you,</v>

1447
01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:52.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a subpersonality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite complex.</v>

1448
01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:57.540
<v Speaker 1>It's got something saving yet you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>not know even what that is because </v>

1449
01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.201
<v Speaker 1>you're acting it out instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding it and because you're </v>

1450
01:17:01.201 --> 01:17:04.891
<v Speaker 1>inside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lays the world out for you in a </v>

1451
01:17:04.891 --> 01:17:04.891
<v Speaker 1>particular way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you,</v>

1452
01:17:04.891 --> 01:17:09.690
<v Speaker 1>it makes the world look like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing you that what you think is </v>

1453
01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:09.690
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's just,</v>

1454
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:11.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your,</v>

1455
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:12.950
<v Speaker 1>what do they say to the man with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer?</v>

1456
01:17:12.951 --> 01:17:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Everything looks like a nail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1457
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1458
01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:19.220
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that's so damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool about that experiment.</v>

1459
01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:20.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1460
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm really that blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could miss something that radical just</v>

1461
01:17:25.461 --> 01:17:28.560
<v Speaker 1>when I'm involved in some dopey task </v>
<v Speaker 1>like counting basketballs.</v>

1462
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:31.270
<v Speaker 1>It makes me so blind to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost beyond comprehension.</v>

1463
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in some ways,</v>

1464
01:17:33.771 --> 01:17:38.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you skipped between different states of </v>

1465
01:17:38.771 --> 01:17:39.140
<v Speaker 1>blindness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of them are biologically motivated.</v>

1466
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Then you turn those into a hierarchy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of your higher value system </v>

1467
01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:48.490
<v Speaker 1>and then that thing points you at </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and the whole world lays </v>

1468
01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:51.701
<v Speaker 1>itself out around that and the way it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does is it divides the world and do </v>

1469
01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:55.391
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant things and so those would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been the curtains in this </v>

1470
01:17:55.391 --> 01:17:59.380
<v Speaker 1>particular example or the gorilla or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even a player in black lift the game </v>

1471
01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:01.040
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant because it didn't interfere </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you counting.</v>

1472
01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So what you look at makes most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world irrelevant.</v>

1473
01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:08.600
<v Speaker 1>It makes some things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that serve you and that makes you</v>

1474
01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.970
<v Speaker 1>feel positive emotion and it makes other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1475
01:18:10.971 --> 01:18:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Things that get in your way and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes negative emotions.</v>

1476
01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got the hypothalamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that point you in biological </v>

1477
01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.220
<v Speaker 1>directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You organize those and then it's like as</v>

1478
01:18:22.221 --> 01:18:27.221
<v Speaker 1>you're approaching the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming at the positive emotion </v>

1479
01:18:27.221 --> 01:18:29.200
<v Speaker 1>systems telling you when you're on track</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the negative emotion systems telling</v>

1480
01:18:29.201 --> 01:18:34.201
<v Speaker 1>you when something's interfering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are actually different </v>

1481
01:18:34.201 --> 01:18:35.810
<v Speaker 1>neurological systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not in the hypothalamus.</v>

1482
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:38.120
<v Speaker 1>The positive emotion system is to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

1483
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:43.600
<v Speaker 1>but the negative emotion system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that evolved later and there's a </v>

1484
01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 1>couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one that produces pain,</v>

1485
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.240
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about it more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's another one that produces </v>

1486
01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.840
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and so we're also now you kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of understand the relationship,</v>

1487
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:53.810
<v Speaker 1>roughly the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>

1488
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:57.520
<v Speaker 1>perception and emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1489
01:18:57.590 --> 01:19:02.150
<v Speaker 1>they all act together and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent in this weird way in,</v>

1490
01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:07.180
<v Speaker 1>on what you're after so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that for 50 years and you </v>

1491
01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:08.030
<v Speaker 1>won't get to the bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1492
01:19:08.031 --> 01:19:10.070
<v Speaker 1>the Buddhists say that everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion,</v>

1493
01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Maya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1494
01:19:10.731 --> 01:19:15.731
<v Speaker 1>People live in illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is what you're aiming at determines </v>

1495
01:19:15.731 --> 01:19:18.280
<v Speaker 1>what you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1496
01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:19.490
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>
