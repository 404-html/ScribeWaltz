1
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to talk about piaget </v>

2
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>today and as I believe I mentioned to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you before,</v>

3
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Psj was perhaps the 20 20th centuries </v>
<v Speaker 1>for most developmental psychologist.</v>

4
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>He didn't regard himself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>

5
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

6
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:32.271
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the people who've been great </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists have come in from outside </v>

7
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:32.271
<v Speaker 1>the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often engineers,</v>

8
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers that helped us establish most </v>

9
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>of our statistics anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget,</v>

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I suppose would have regarded himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>more as a biologist be called themselves</v>

11
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>a genetic epistemologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by genetic he didn't mean the genes </v>

12
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>that organize your cells and spin you up</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of nothing.</v>

13
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.150
<v Speaker 1>He meant beginnings as in genesis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then an epistemologist with someone who </v>

14
00:00:56.161 --> 00:01:01.161
<v Speaker 1>was interested in how structures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge emerge and how they're </v>

15
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:05.871
<v Speaker 1>constituted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we actually thought of himself as a </v>

16
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:07.911
<v Speaker 1>biological philosopher now know one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that's kind of sad about </v>

17
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:14.331
<v Speaker 1>learning about great theories is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll hardly ever learned about how </v>

18
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>peculiar that people who formulate them </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

19
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Because generally they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily interesting people you </v>

20
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.131
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that in some ways that often </v>

21
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>they get sanitized in some way once </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've become respectable.</v>

22
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:30.681
<v Speaker 1>And that's really quite unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget was really a genius.</v>

23
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>He was offered a position at a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>museum,</v>

24
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>and I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember correctly,</v>

25
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>it was perhaps it wasn't director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the position of approximately</v>

26
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>that stature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was offered that when he was 10 years</v>

27
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd written a paper on Mollusk behavior</v>

28
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:53.181
<v Speaker 1>which was published and his parents told</v>
<v Speaker 1>the museum people that he,</v>

29
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>of course they didn't know he was 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>that he probably wasn't up for the job </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time.</v>

31
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that gives you some example,</v>

32
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>some idea about the magnitude of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellect and Piaget wrote a lot.</v>

33
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually what you hear about if you study</v>

34
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>piaget in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hear about piaget,</v>

35
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>you hear about his stages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>

36
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 1>sensory motor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

37
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.650
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really wasn't what piaget was all </v>

38
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.431
<v Speaker 1>that interest to Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wAs something about the idea of </v>

39
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:28.761
<v Speaker 1>countable stages that seem to appeal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>north american developmental </v>

40
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:34.221
<v Speaker 1>psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but piaget didn't really regard that </v>

41
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>necessarily as either the central or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important part of this theoretical </v>

42
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>edifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.350
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what piaget has been criticized </v>

44
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.290
<v Speaker 1>for in recent years is that the stages </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily occur either as he </v>

45
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>described her in the order that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>described,</v>

46
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:52.071
<v Speaker 1>but in some ways he wouldn't have found </v>
<v Speaker 1>that particularly distressing because it</v>

47
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:57.141
<v Speaker 1>was more of an attempt to explain how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality emerged out.</v>

48
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Nothing in some ways because in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways you've kind of emerged out of </v>

49
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.080
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.831
<v Speaker 1>and it's not that easy to figure out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget in some ways you've sort of </v>

51
00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:11.971
<v Speaker 1>booted up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although he wouldn't haVe used that </v>

52
00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>metaphor obviously having existed in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time before.</v>

53
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.670
<v Speaker 1>That was a commonly known phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he also was concerned abouT high </v>

54
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:27.181
<v Speaker 1>level metaphysical problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that really </v>

55
00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:31.890
<v Speaker 1>motivated piaget was the contradiction </v>
<v Speaker 1>between science and religion.</v>

56
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.620
<v Speaker 1>That was very painful for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he had set </v>

57
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.461
<v Speaker 1>out to do as a young man was to bridge </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gap between science and religion.</v>

58
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.040
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways you might think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in relationship to the sorts of </v>

59
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.761
<v Speaker 1>things we talked about last class is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was attempting to bridge the gap</v>

60
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>between a description of the world and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescriptive description of the world,</v>

61
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>which means what the world is and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world should be or what the world is</v>

62
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:04.951
<v Speaker 1>and how you should act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's the most </v>

63
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:09.451
<v Speaker 1>straightforward way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the division between religion and </v>

64
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>science because you need to know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

65
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.090
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it as a division </v>
<v Speaker 1>between morality and science or you can </v>

66
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>think about it as a division between </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral wisdom and science,</v>

67
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:18.210
<v Speaker 1>which I think is even a better way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it because it,</v>

68
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>it takes the specifically religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>element out of it.</v>

69
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

70
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>piaget wanted to devote his life to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solving that problem.</v>

71
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:33.841
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also identified an interesting stage </v>

72
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:39.061
<v Speaker 1>that you also hear very little about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seems to be to be something worthy </v>

73
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>of note and also worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration.</v>

74
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.990
<v Speaker 1>He thought that many people in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>late adolescence went through a </v>

75
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.291
<v Speaker 1>messiaNic stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he meant by that was that when </v>

76
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>late adolescents or young adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to orient themselves in the</v>

77
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:56.401
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to figure out how they </v>

78
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 1>might plot their pAth forward in life so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they actually made a difference,</v>

79
00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:02.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they started to become concerned </v>

80
00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>about the state of the world and about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their role in determining that state and</v>

81
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>getting interested in and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in large scale political or </v>

82
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 1>social movements.</v>

83
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.250
<v Speaker 1>And he was the only psychologists that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen who actually identified </v>

84
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>that as a stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's switched.</v>

85
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.880
<v Speaker 1>because it certainly is the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>many young people do pass through a </v>

87
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>stage that's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

88
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to speculate on it as a</v>

89
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>standard part of human development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

90
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:35.311
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably more </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of people with certain </v>

91
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:38.581
<v Speaker 1>personality types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I suspect if you're more extroverted </v>

92
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:38.581
<v Speaker 1>and you're more open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

93
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>particularly more open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the creativity dimension in the</v>

94
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 1>big five that you're more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically and socially,</v>

95
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compelled,</v>

96
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we know,</v>

97
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:53.221
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that openness is a very good predictor </v>

98
00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>of things like political liberalism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly a lot of the millennial </v>

100
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.841
<v Speaker 1>movements and that religious movements </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you see on campus that have what </v>

101
00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>would arguably be a political base </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be associated with high </v>

102
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>

103
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that stage doesn't occur in </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's life,</v>

104
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly seems to occur in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's lives.</v>

105
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might ask yourself,</v>

106
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was piaget up to?</v>

107
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:21.281
<v Speaker 1>And while he wanted to figure out a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things and he was interested in very,</v>

108
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>very fundamental issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

109
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>his theories dealt with things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>number in space.</v>

110
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Product can't see that very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

111
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and speed,</v>

112
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>permanent objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did,</v>

113
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 1>how did a person developed the notion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what constituted a permanent object?</v>

114
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 1>How do you know when one thing is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same?</v>

115
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 1>When it changes into something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

116
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:47.831
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you pour one bit of liquid from one </v>

117
00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:50.501
<v Speaker 1>container into another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that the amount of </v>

118
00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:50.501
<v Speaker 1>liquid is the same?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

119
00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 1>how do children develop their ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance and causality?</v>

120
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 1>How do they develop their concerns about</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality and their moral knowledge?</v>

121
00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.260
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

122
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing?</v>

123
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.550
<v Speaker 1>And I think actually piaget's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental contribution as far as I'm </v>

124
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came in his studies and analysis of play</v>

125
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 1>and also to some degree his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his analysis of dreams and he also spent</v>

126
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 1>a lot of time giving serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration to the role that imitation</v>

127
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:22.361
<v Speaker 1>played in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the scaffolding of the human </v>

128
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

129
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some of the,</v>

130
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

131
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget believed that,</v>

132
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the easiest way to talk </v>

133
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.120
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually will use this diagram here.</v>

134
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.500
<v Speaker 1>So I'll shut this light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go off.</v>

135
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.920
<v Speaker 1>It took me a long time to construct this</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagram.</v>

136
00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:04.440
<v Speaker 1>So not because it's all that technically</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

137
00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 1>but it took a while to think it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to give you a little bit about</v>

138
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.660
<v Speaker 1>background to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I imagine that</v>

139
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:19.380
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that distinguishes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being from a computational device </v>

140
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.981
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least the standard sort of </v>

141
00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:22.981
<v Speaker 1>computational devices that are primary </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive problem,</v>

142
00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:26.440
<v Speaker 1>is how to perceive the world so that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can act in it so that we can get what we</v>

143
00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:28.330
<v Speaker 1>need to have or one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

144
00:08:28.331 --> 00:08:31.270
<v Speaker 1>so all three of those things are roughly</v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent importance,</v>

145
00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:36.271
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to perceive and you </v>

146
00:08:36.271 --> 00:08:36.850
<v Speaker 1>have to be able to act because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't act and he can't get what you need</v>

147
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:39.490
<v Speaker 1>and if you can't get what you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course there isn't an you.</v>

148
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.910
<v Speaker 1>And so we're trying to always solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>those problems simultaneously and we're </v>

149
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.420
<v Speaker 1>also trying to do it in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable.</v>

150
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means in part is that the </v>

151
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.100
<v Speaker 1>knowledge structures of human beings are</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized or or they are organized along</v>

152
00:08:56.971 --> 00:09:01.971
<v Speaker 1>those three dimensions in those three </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions also constitute the problem </v>

153
00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:01.971
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

154
00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:06.320
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to be addressed for a solUtion </v>

155
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.411
<v Speaker 1>to be useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not only do you have to be able to </v>

156
00:09:09.411 --> 00:09:13.040
<v Speaker 1>perceive in some accurate manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the accuracy is determined in part </v>

157
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.970
<v Speaker 1>on in terms of whether or not the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're perceiving helps you pursue </v>

158
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.381
<v Speaker 1>something that you want to pursue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the utility of wanting to pursue </v>

159
00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:25.071
<v Speaker 1>something is dependent to some degree on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the utility of </v>

160
00:09:25.071 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 1>that and the things that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to survive.</v>

161
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Now some psychologists have addressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that by thinking about such things as </v>

162
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 1>fundamental drives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:39.170
<v Speaker 1>and that was mostly a behavioral idea in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways and the drive might be hunger </v>

164
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.320
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea of a drive would be that </v>

165
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.731
<v Speaker 1>hunger is a motivator that helps you put</v>
<v Speaker 1>together a strings of motor behaviors </v>

166
00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:48.540
<v Speaker 1>that are sort of run out in automatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence so that you can,</v>

167
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you can get the end that you want and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue one perhaps to fulfill another </v>

168
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.020
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>

169
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of drive is a little bit on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oversimplified side.</v>

170
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:03.770
<v Speaker 1>although it has its place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that you can conceptualize the </v>

171
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 1>relationship between all of these by </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking in the following manner.</v>

172
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:11.370
<v Speaker 1>So imagine first of all that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>after something,</v>

173
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.590
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

174
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>if you look at us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of tell that were the sorts</v>

175
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:21.471
<v Speaker 1>of creatures that are after things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that you can tell that is first </v>

176
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:23.070
<v Speaker 1>of all that we can move and do so </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently,</v>

177
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:27.030
<v Speaker 1>so we're always on a voyage of some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a journey of some sort from point one</v>

178
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>to point to or from point a to point b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say as well that that's also the</v>

179
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.820
<v Speaker 1>hallmark of a simple story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're telling someone a story,</v>

180
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:39.030
<v Speaker 1>generally what you do is you tell them </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a time that you were somewhere and</v>

181
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:41.100
<v Speaker 1>then you did some things and you went </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else.</v>

182
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very simple story.</v>

183
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Now the advantage of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a story is that it helps you </v>

184
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:55.431
<v Speaker 1>understand that the entire cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure can't be reduced to </v>

185
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 1>necessarily anything that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

186
00:10:58.771 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 1>that's drive like you have to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it as more personality like and so</v>

187
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.120
<v Speaker 1>you want something you orient yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards.</v>

188
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you do that,</v>

189
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:09.840
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is with your sensory and your conceptual</v>

190
00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

191
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to walk towards the door,</v>

192
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:18.020
<v Speaker 1>then you turn your head and you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself a mortal of the door and that </v>

193
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.281
<v Speaker 1>model has to be bounded by its relevance</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your action so you know the things </v>

194
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:25.980
<v Speaker 1>that are going to be relevant to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the door,</v>

195
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:28.200
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be whether or not it's tall enough</v>

196
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:33.201
<v Speaker 1>for you to walk through or whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the door is open or closed so that </v>

197
00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're walking towards it,</v>

198
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:38.451
<v Speaker 1>you can organize your body so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can interact with the object as you see </v>

199
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 1>fit.</v>

200
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Now you pick your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know search for all sorts of different </v>

201
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.650
<v Speaker 1>reasons and some of those reasons are </v>
<v Speaker 1>more fundamental than others.</v>

202
00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental by fundamental,</v>

203
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I would mean likely what I mean by </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental,</v>

204
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 1>something like evolutionarily ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the older,</v>

206
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.640
<v Speaker 1>the necessity or the older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system that's evolved to to allow </v>

207
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:08.791
<v Speaker 1>you to pursue the necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more fundamental it is and there's </v>

208
00:12:08.791 --> 00:12:12.210
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's ways of identifying what </v>

209
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 1>constitutes the fundamental elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal seeking behavior,</v>

210
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that in part by comparing</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to other animals,</v>

211
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so mammals,</v>

212
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:23.731
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all seem to jet to experience something </v>

213
00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>that you might regard as anger or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least defensive aggression.</v>

214
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:26.620
<v Speaker 1>They're all hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.170
<v Speaker 1>they all have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

216
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 1>they all act as if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

217
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.620
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

218
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they highly value sexual behavior and so</v>

219
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

220
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.860
<v Speaker 1>And so those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really think of those things </v>

221
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.680
<v Speaker 1>as a specifically human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a lower level than that now.</v>

222
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.490
<v Speaker 1>So at a fundamental level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have biological systems that are </v>

223
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.590
<v Speaker 1>setting forth what might constitute a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

224
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.800
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think that what the system is </v>

225
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.921
<v Speaker 1>doing is setting the goal or you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that the system is driving </v>

226
00:12:58.921 --> 00:12:59.980
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a better way of thinking about it is</v>

227
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:04.981
<v Speaker 1>that the fundamental motivation </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational system sets up a framework </v>

228
00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>that's like a personality that then acts</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

229
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 1>And so this personality has something in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind that it wants.</v>

230
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:18.030
<v Speaker 1>It has a collection of perceptions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize itself around that thing that </v>

231
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.751
<v Speaker 1>it wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it has a plan or associated </v>

232
00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:24.991
<v Speaker 1>motor behaviors that it can lay out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world that will take it from the </v>

233
00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:26.800
<v Speaker 1>point where it is to the point that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be okay now.</v>

234
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.830
<v Speaker 1>So once you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can start to think about these </v>

235
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.210
<v Speaker 1>plans or these goals or these stories or</v>
<v Speaker 1>these frameworks.</v>

236
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I think those are all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can even think about them as games.</v>

237
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:41.791
<v Speaker 1>In some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about them at different </v>

238
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:43.390
<v Speaker 1>levels of complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what piaget was trying to do in part</v>

239
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:48.391
<v Speaker 1>was to describe how a framework of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort or a sub,</v>

240
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.560
<v Speaker 1>a sub element of personality might </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop itself and complexity over time.</v>

241
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:59.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the diagram I have here before he </v>

242
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.990
<v Speaker 1>shows these little oval like figures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bottom left hand corner there's a</v>

243
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.660
<v Speaker 1>box that says what is in the top right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand corner.</v>

244
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:12.661
<v Speaker 1>There's a box that says what should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's some arrows showing a </v>

245
00:14:12.661 --> 00:14:14.680
<v Speaker 1>planned sequence of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that you have a sense of</v>

246
00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:19.681
<v Speaker 1>where you are and you have a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're going and that constitutes </v>

247
00:14:19.681 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 1>the framework within which you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world.</v>

248
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:25.410
<v Speaker 1>And then within that framework there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that you can do with </v>

249
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 1>your body in order to advance from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first point,</v>

250
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 1>the second point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's important to understand that </v>

251
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.511
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing is grounded in </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and not in conception because </v>

252
00:14:36.511 --> 00:14:40.530
<v Speaker 1>it helps you also understand the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these fundamental elements of </v>

253
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:45.271
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental elements of personality </v>

254
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:47.380
<v Speaker 1>or not descriptions of the world are </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools for acting in the world,</v>

255
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:49.570
<v Speaker 1>including the associated behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

256
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:54.690
<v Speaker 1>whether they're behavioral or to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree depends on their level of </v>

257
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:55.780
<v Speaker 1>abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

258
00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 1>so here's how you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to think about that.</v>

259
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you say that someone's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good person and you might say,</v>

260
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:05.510
<v Speaker 1>well that's a description of the and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

261
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:10.570
<v Speaker 1>And when you think about description,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to think about description in </v>

262
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:10.790
<v Speaker 1>the way that you would describe an </v>
<v Speaker 1>object in the world,</v>

263
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 1>like a scientific description.</v>

264
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.000
<v Speaker 1>But when you talk about someone as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good person,</v>

265
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 1>you're actually not describing them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an object in the world,</v>

266
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.020
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even describe yourself as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>object in the world,</v>

267
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:26.021
<v Speaker 1>that way what you're doing is using a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shorthand to represent a higher the </v>

268
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:31.190
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical arrangement of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and you can get away with it</v>

269
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 1>because when you say good person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

270
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:38.771
<v Speaker 1>they already have an understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>good person and they know what that </v>

271
00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:41.681
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy is and so you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain the whole thing to them and you </v>

272
00:15:41.681 --> 00:15:45.461
<v Speaker 1>can understand each other without even </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily knowing exactly the details </v>

273
00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:49.481
<v Speaker 1>of what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going to tell you now what I </v>

274
00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:49.880
<v Speaker 1>think you mean when you say that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

275
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.520
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that good person is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>description at the very,</v>

276
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.930
<v Speaker 1>at the top end of a hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

277
00:15:56.931 --> 00:16:01.931
<v Speaker 1>because good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good is a very high level </v>

278
00:16:01.931 --> 00:16:01.970
<v Speaker 1>philosophical abstraction.</v>

279
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a high level value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be good.</v>

280
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

281
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:08.060
<v Speaker 1>If you decompose it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

282
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.970
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it in a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward manner.</v>

283
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:15.971
<v Speaker 1>One that isn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more observational than </v>

284
00:16:15.971 --> 00:16:16.430
<v Speaker 1>philosophical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you take,</v>

285
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.880
<v Speaker 1>you take someone who's a 40 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother for the sake of argument and who </v>

286
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.480
<v Speaker 1>will say she also has a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if she's a good person and she's a </v>

287
00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:33.701
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that's one sub element </v>

288
00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:36.071
<v Speaker 1>of her personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she's a good person is being a good </v>

289
00:16:36.071 --> 00:16:36.071
<v Speaker 1>parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

290
00:16:36.071 --> 00:16:40.091
<v Speaker 1>And I think you've put person above </v>
<v Speaker 1>parent in the hierarchy because to be a </v>

291
00:16:40.091 --> 00:16:42.260
<v Speaker 1>good person you can be a good parent </v>
<v Speaker 1>without being a good person,</v>

292
00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to see how you could be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good person without being a good parent.</v>

293
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe if you're a good person,</v>

294
00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:52.211
<v Speaker 1>you're more than a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're probably a good partner </v>

295
00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:52.640
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're good at your job and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there are,</v>

296
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:57.700
<v Speaker 1>there are large domains of activity that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good at or good in and with some </v>

297
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:04.390
<v Speaker 1>your behavior across that are average </v>
<v Speaker 1>year behavior across that or something </v>

298
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.390
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

299
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Then you ended up reasonably being </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as a good person.</v>

300
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:10.691
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a good friend as well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so good person has levels of hierarchy </v>

301
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Speaker 1>underneath it and were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then each of those things that have </v>

302
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.511
<v Speaker 1>levels of hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of those entities at the level of </v>

303
00:17:19.511 --> 00:17:19.910
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right underneath,</v>

304
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:24.911
<v Speaker 1>good person can also be decomposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to decompose them and </v>

305
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:28.601
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because partly what happens is if you </v>

306
00:17:28.601 --> 00:17:28.700
<v Speaker 1>decompose them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get right to the bottom.</v>

307
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not an infinite decomposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I also think this is one way that</v>

308
00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:36.520
<v Speaker 1>you can think about the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the mind and the body because of</v>

309
00:17:36.521 --> 00:17:41.521
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the mind and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the body is a very tricky thing because </v>

310
00:17:41.521 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 1>the mind seems to be made of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's other than the body.</v>

311
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:48.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's some truth to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because we don't really </v>

312
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 1>understand consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are.</v>

313
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.770
<v Speaker 1>But that's a complex problem and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a fair ways in addressing </v>

314
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.270
<v Speaker 1>the mind body problem without having to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drag into the problem of consciousness.</v>

315
00:17:57.271 --> 00:17:58.800
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we could say,</v>

316
00:17:58.801 --> 00:18:02.550
<v Speaker 1>well good person sub element of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>good parent.</v>

317
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what is it that you need to be </v>

318
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 1>doing to be a good parent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we might say,</v>

319
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:11.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a good job,</v>

320
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's one up in the hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever,</v>

321
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a good job because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you can't provide for your </v>

322
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.070
<v Speaker 1>children and you have to be able to care</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the children.</v>

323
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:20.550
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

324
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:23.760
<v Speaker 1>someoNe's good at caring for children </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might ask them,</v>

325
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:28.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to be good at caring </v>

326
00:18:28.761 --> 00:18:30.921
<v Speaker 1>for children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to sort of think of </v>

327
00:18:30.921 --> 00:18:31.800
<v Speaker 1>the sub elements that would go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>caring for children.</v>

328
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.800
<v Speaker 1>And so one of them here is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to cook a meal or complete a </v>

329
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.571
<v Speaker 1>meal and then you also have to know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to play with the baby so we could </v>

330
00:18:41.571 --> 00:18:45.171
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on playing with the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do when you're playing </v>

331
00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:45.660
<v Speaker 1>with a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might play peekaboo.</v>

332
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 1>You might tickle the baby and you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>clean the baby.</v>

333
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you start thinking,</v>

334
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:54.120
<v Speaker 1>well obviously once you're starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get down to that level of detail.</v>

335
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.280
<v Speaker 1>So that's a high resolution model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

336
00:18:56.281 --> 00:19:01.281
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're starting to move from a low </v>

337
00:19:01.281 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 1>resolution model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good person to a high resolution model,</v>

338
00:19:01.291 --> 00:19:05.370
<v Speaker 1>which are what are precisely the </v>
<v Speaker 1>multitude of elements that make up being</v>

339
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:06.570
<v Speaker 1>a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

340
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:09.420
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing peekaboo with a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

341
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.660
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly conceptual.</v>

342
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Being a good person is conceptual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but playing peekaboo isn't conceptual </v>

343
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.981
<v Speaker 1>and the reason it's not conceptual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because he actually have to move </v>

344
00:19:21.981 --> 00:19:21.981
<v Speaker 1>your hands to do it.</v>

345
00:19:21.981 --> 00:19:26.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you get to a high enough level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution in the description of a </v>

346
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.591
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you start describing our patterns </v>

347
00:19:30.591 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they have associated,</v>

348
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:36.170
<v Speaker 1>you know they have an associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational framework and a viewpoint </v>

349
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.530
<v Speaker 1>that goes along with them so that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>

350
00:19:37.531 --> 00:19:42.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even while you're playing peekaboo with </v>

351
00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:42.531
<v Speaker 1>the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

352
00:19:42.531 --> 00:19:46.220
<v Speaker 1>the element of you that's playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>peekaboo is best described as a </v>

353
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.900
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a playful subpersonality and then </v>

354
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.811
<v Speaker 1>it's the subpersonality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically knows how and is motivated </v>

355
00:19:53.811 --> 00:19:58.011
<v Speaker 1>to play peekaboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what it's composed of is no longer </v>

356
00:19:58.011 --> 00:20:00.780
<v Speaker 1>as subpersonality it starting to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>composed of actual movements.</v>

357
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.330
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then underneath that,</v>

358
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:05.190
<v Speaker 1>if you go to higher resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

359
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:07.140
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the movement composed of?</v>

360
00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:12.141
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously you start to have to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about musculature and then if you go </v>

361
00:20:12.141 --> 00:20:12.540
<v Speaker 1>below that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's molecular movements and so on,</v>

362
00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:17.541
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you're down below a voluntary </v>

363
00:20:17.541 --> 00:20:17.640
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really no you there anymore,</v>

364
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

365
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 1>You sort of fade into unconsciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know how to go like this,</v>

366
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:27.170
<v Speaker 1>but you don't exactly know how to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>the specific muscles that enable you to </v>

367
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 1>go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or even if you do,</v>

368
00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:31.200
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to twitch the muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>fibers or something like that.</v>

369
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some law.</v>

370
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:37.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how to operate the cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some level of resolution </v>

371
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:41.840
<v Speaker 1>underneath voluntary motor control that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that basically runs on automatic and to </v>

372
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.850
<v Speaker 1>some degree you're capable of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>steering it,</v>

373
00:20:44.851 --> 00:20:49.851
<v Speaker 1>but you're not really capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're certainly not capable of being </v>

374
00:20:49.851 --> 00:20:50.670
<v Speaker 1>conscious of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

375
00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.400
<v Speaker 1>the abstract moral conception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also a description,</v>

376
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:59.430
<v Speaker 1>good person hits the world at the level </v>
<v Speaker 1>of motor output now and a lot like even </v>

377
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:01.460
<v Speaker 1>your sensory movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of outs,</v>

378
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.440
<v Speaker 1>motor outPut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

379
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Because a lot of what you're doing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes is moving them,</v>

380
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:10.140
<v Speaker 1>so all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now what does that have to do with </v>

381
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:10.140
<v Speaker 1>piaget?</v>

382
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways of understanding piaget </v>

383
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.711
<v Speaker 1>is that he built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really interested in </v>

384
00:21:16.711 --> 00:21:19.741
<v Speaker 1>understanding how that entire system </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to be and his theory is a bottom up</v>

385
00:21:20.201 --> 00:21:22.510
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

386
00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:23.120
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

387
00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.730
<v Speaker 1>this is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

388
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.480
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't said this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very useful way of thinking </v>

389
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.541
<v Speaker 1>about it because piaget believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you started with small elements of what </v>

390
00:21:33.541 --> 00:21:38.371
<v Speaker 1>he called reflexive behavior and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn to chain them together and </v>

391
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:43.381
<v Speaker 1>increasingly complex structures and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you chain those complex structures into </v>

392
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:48.511
<v Speaker 1>more and more complex structures and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>on and so forth until you built up the </v>

393
00:21:48.511 --> 00:21:50.140
<v Speaker 1>entire hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you tended to start from the bottom.</v>

394
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:55.530
<v Speaker 1>So piaget was particularly interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the minimum conditions were for </v>

395
00:21:57.911 --> 00:22:02.911
<v Speaker 1>something to emerge into the world so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he could build itself out of </v>

396
00:22:02.911 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what he was interested</v>

397
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:07.390
<v Speaker 1>in when he was starting to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>infant development.</v>

398
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.450
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget's hypothesis with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this,</v>

399
00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 1>well kill babies are born very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very immature.</v>

400
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.700
<v Speaker 1>You might even say that they're born </v>
<v Speaker 1>premature,</v>

401
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.900
<v Speaker 1>so I'm a human baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you took a mammal,</v>

402
00:22:22.901 --> 00:22:27.901
<v Speaker 1>have read about human size and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's its average gestation period</v>

403
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 1>across the animal kingdom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd find out that for an animal of our</v>

404
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 1>size we should have a gestation period </v>
<v Speaker 1>of pregnancy period of two years.</v>

405
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:41.310
<v Speaker 1>So we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hAve a gestation period of nine </v>

406
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.310
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might ask,</v>

407
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.100
<v Speaker 1>well why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is complicated.</v>

408
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you've got to hear some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons as far as people can tell 'em we</v>

409
00:22:50.141 --> 00:22:55.141
<v Speaker 1>have big heads and they've really been </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding rapidly over particularly over</v>

410
00:22:55.541 --> 00:23:00.541
<v Speaker 1>the last 2 million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's say since we split off from </v>

411
00:23:00.541 --> 00:23:01.750
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about 6 million years.</v>

412
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.240
<v Speaker 1>We have very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very large heads and you know,</v>

413
00:23:04.241 --> 00:23:09.241
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a baby's head is pretty damn </v>

414
00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:09.241
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately large compared to its</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

415
00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Like a baby's like a third hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even when the baby's little nine </v>

416
00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:15.760
<v Speaker 1>months old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

417
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:20.790
<v Speaker 1>nine months after conception and maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and three months before it's </v>

418
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.140
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's head is already extremely big.</v>

419
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Now you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the problem with that?</v>

420
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:27.610
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is while the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger your head is,</v>

421
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:30.070
<v Speaker 1>the harder it is to be born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

422
00:23:30.071 --> 00:23:35.071
<v Speaker 1>well why haven't the pelvic areas of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings adjusted females in </v>

423
00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:40.441
<v Speaker 1>particular adjusted so that they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle the birth with a larger head and </v>

424
00:23:40.631 --> 00:23:42.850
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to some degree,</v>

425
00:23:42.851 --> 00:23:45.590
<v Speaker 1>which is why women have wider hips that </v>
<v Speaker 1>men do.</v>

426
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.620
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is evolution is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative business and it can only in</v>

427
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:53.780
<v Speaker 1>some sense tinker with what it's already</v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

428
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:58.781
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look at the basic bought </v>
<v Speaker 1>your basic body plan,</v>

429
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:04.420
<v Speaker 1>your basic body plan in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most in its most fundamental levels was </v>

430
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.580
<v Speaker 1>established some tens of millions or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even hundreds of millions of years ago.</v>

431
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:12.850
<v Speaker 1>And then the basic mammalian body plan </v>
<v Speaker 1>was established say 60 million years </v>

432
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:14.240
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you go,</v>

433
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:19.241
<v Speaker 1>I went to the smithsonian wants and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a skeleton museum at the </v>

434
00:24:19.241 --> 00:24:19.640
<v Speaker 1>smithsonian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a zoo for,</v>

435
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:24.790
<v Speaker 1>for skeletons and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting place to go because you can </v>

436
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:28.360
<v Speaker 1>see much more help and like mammals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see their skeleton.</v>

437
00:24:28.361 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see a bat skeleton,</v>

438
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.650
<v Speaker 1>it looks just like a human skeleton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the fingers are really,</v>

439
00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:36.080
<v Speaker 1>really long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the rest of it's like,</v>

440
00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:41.081
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically the same skeleton as a </v>

441
00:24:41.081 --> 00:24:43.421
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IT's just that the pieces have blown up </v>

442
00:24:43.421 --> 00:24:43.421
<v Speaker 1>in size or shrunk or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

443
00:24:43.421 --> 00:24:48.070
<v Speaker 1>or contorted or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's exactly the same damn </v>

444
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.350
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as,</v>

445
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.850
<v Speaker 1>as the brain was growing in the skull </v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting larger and women,</v>

446
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:57.970
<v Speaker 1>women's bodies had to adapt to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>while there was parameters within which </v>

447
00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:58.190
<v Speaker 1>the body had to work.</v>

448
00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that if you make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hips any wider and you make the hole in </v>

449
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:04.580
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the many bigger than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hips start to lose structural integrity.</v>

450
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.760
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing that starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen is the woman can't run.</v>

451
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:13.330
<v Speaker 1>So there's this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine that evolution takes place </v>

452
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:16.031
<v Speaker 1>within this set of constraints and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is the baby gets born </v>

453
00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:20.111
<v Speaker 1>way earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women's hips are wider with the </v>

454
00:25:20.111 --> 00:25:21.080
<v Speaker 1>larger pelvic whole but not so wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't run and not so wide.</v>

455
00:25:21.081 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 1>They're not strong and the baby's head </v>
<v Speaker 1>is collapsible roughly because the bones</v>

456
00:25:25.671 --> 00:25:29.390
<v Speaker 1>aren't completely fused at birth and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally,</v>

457
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.460
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a larger baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's born,</v>

458
00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:34.700
<v Speaker 1>when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it emerges just after birth,</v>

459
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 1>it's head is quite compressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cone Shaped even so.</v>

460
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:43.361
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard on the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not nearly as hard on the baby </v>

461
00:25:43.361 --> 00:25:43.361
<v Speaker 1>or the mother as not being born at all.</v>

462
00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.170
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies are born pretty premature and you</v>

463
00:25:47.171 --> 00:25:52.171
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that puts a tremendous burden on human </v>

464
00:25:52.171 --> 00:25:54.770
<v Speaker 1>parents because of course the child is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even walk for the first year.</v>

465
00:25:54.771 --> 00:25:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you take a deer when a deer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>born or an animal like that,</v>

466
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's three minutes later,</v>

467
00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:05.981
<v Speaker 1>it's wobbling around on its feet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's running away from lions the </v>

468
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:05.981
<v Speaker 1>next morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

469
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:06.620
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not us.</v>

470
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:07.490
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

471
00:26:07.491 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 1>It's well were born very premature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

472
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:13.280
<v Speaker 1>very vulnerable and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a major load on the,</v>

473
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.110
<v Speaker 1>on the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

474
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.500
<v Speaker 1>One question piaget was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

475
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is a baby born with?</v>

476
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.940
<v Speaker 1>And he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

477
00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:26.150
<v Speaker 1>they're born with a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is here's three things.</v>

478
00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:31.151
<v Speaker 1>In a sense you might think they're born </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a couple of reflexes and what you </v>

479
00:26:31.151 --> 00:26:35.351
<v Speaker 1>might think of a as a reflex is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a built in module of sensory motor </v>

480
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.570
<v Speaker 1>capability and maybe it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

481
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a motivational element to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as well.</v>

482
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:46.170
<v Speaker 1>So I would say it's a built in </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonality and it's a very narrow.</v>

483
00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Subpersonality has a very narrow cast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one thing,</v>

484
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.500
<v Speaker 1>one thing babies can do is route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you touch them on the site,</v>

485
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:54.360
<v Speaker 1>if they're cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they route.</v>

486
00:26:54.361 --> 00:26:59.361
<v Speaker 1>And basically what that means is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they use their mouth and their head to </v>

487
00:26:59.361 --> 00:27:00.930
<v Speaker 1>search for something to latch onto with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mouth.</v>

488
00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:05.850
<v Speaker 1>And that would generally be a nipple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they come pre wired to be able to use</v>

489
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:10.851
<v Speaker 1>their mouth and their tongue and certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles have their head in order to </v>

490
00:27:10.851 --> 00:27:13.320
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to feed and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a very complicated behavior.</v>

491
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:18.321
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you see with </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies is that their mouth and their </v>

492
00:27:18.321 --> 00:27:21.951
<v Speaker 1>tongue is quite wired up already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're looking at a newborn baby,</v>

493
00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:26.700
<v Speaker 1>the intelligent part of the baby in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense like the part that's already there</v>

494
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.090
<v Speaker 1>is very much oriented towards health and</v>
<v Speaker 1>its tongue.</v>

495
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's sorta like freud's idea of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>oral stage in some sense.</v>

496
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

497
00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:36.480
<v Speaker 1>you could debate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's partly why freud thought that</v>

498
00:27:36.481 --> 00:27:41.481
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew that babies were very mouth </v>

499
00:27:41.481 --> 00:27:41.940
<v Speaker 1>oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It once they can start using their hands</v>

500
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.630
<v Speaker 1>and they can pick up objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they do with objects?</v>

501
00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.270
<v Speaker 1>I put them in their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

502
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

503
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.430
<v Speaker 1>because that's what babies do partly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the only reason.</v>

504
00:27:53.431 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you look at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

505
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.400
<v Speaker 1>so back in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forties,</v>

506
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.800
<v Speaker 1>maybe even earlier than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a neurosurgeon named what?</v>

507
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Wilder penfield who worked at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>montreal neurological institute and he </v>

508
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:09.350
<v Speaker 1>was one of the people who first did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

509
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.850
<v Speaker 1>surgery for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for epilepsy.</v>

510
00:28:11.851 --> 00:28:16.851
<v Speaker 1>So if you hAve epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is generally you kind of </v>

511
00:28:16.851 --> 00:28:19.881
<v Speaker 1>have a short circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a malfunctioning set of neurons </v>

512
00:28:19.881 --> 00:28:23.570
<v Speaker 1>usually in the hippocampus and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced like a positive feedback </v>

513
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.531
<v Speaker 1>electrical circuit and it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little electrical storm and it'll start </v>

514
00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:29.100
<v Speaker 1>in damaged tissue and that's spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the whole brain.</v>

515
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:34.670
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things the early </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurosurgeons were doing was dividing </v>

516
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.791
<v Speaker 1>the brain into to stop the hemisphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had the damage from being able to </v>

517
00:28:37.791 --> 00:28:40.680
<v Speaker 1>spread pathological electric electricity</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the entire brain.</v>

518
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're doing brain surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to take out anything that</v>

519
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:49.971
<v Speaker 1>isn't absolutely necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things the brain </v>

520
00:28:49.971 --> 00:28:51.720
<v Speaker 1>surgeons do and still do and still do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they do brain surgery.</v>

521
00:28:51.721 --> 00:28:56.721
<v Speaker 1>When you're conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a horrifying thought </v>

522
00:28:56.721 --> 00:29:00.981
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know your head is stuck in </v>

523
00:29:00.981 --> 00:29:00.981
<v Speaker 1>this little machine that doesn't let it </v>
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

524
00:29:00.981 --> 00:29:04.971
<v Speaker 1>and then they're poking around in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain and you have to tell them what's </v>

525
00:29:04.971 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 1>going on while you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you start being able to respond,</v>

526
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:09.280
<v Speaker 1>then I presume they assume that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>made a mistake and you know,</v>

527
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:14.630
<v Speaker 1>tough luck for you at any ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penfield was interested not only in you </v>

528
00:29:15.531 --> 00:29:17.550
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conducting his surgery properly,</v>

529
00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:19.680
<v Speaker 1>but also in mapping out the brain to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out,</v>

530
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what parts of it could use and you know,</v>

531
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.320
<v Speaker 1>do you have to keep and what parts can </v>
<v Speaker 1>you maybe get rid of?</v>

532
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:30.320
<v Speaker 1>And part of that was because there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea for a long time among </v>

533
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.681
<v Speaker 1>neurologists called equal potentiality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant that the cortex was an </v>

534
00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:39.021
<v Speaker 1>undifferentiated mass of tissue and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take out parts of it without really </v>

535
00:29:39.021 --> 00:29:43.281
<v Speaker 1>much loss of function at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which that turned out not to be exactly </v>

536
00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:48.481
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it wasn't as stupid as an idea </v>

537
00:29:48.481 --> 00:29:51.091
<v Speaker 1>as it might seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the cortex is less </v>

538
00:29:51.091 --> 00:29:51.091
<v Speaker 1>differentiated than other parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

539
00:29:51.091 --> 00:29:53.200
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that if you take out </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of it,</v>

540
00:29:53.201 --> 00:29:58.201
<v Speaker 1>like the prefrontal cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the damage that it does is not </v>

541
00:29:58.201 --> 00:30:01.561
<v Speaker 1>immediately evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you watch the person for any </v>

542
00:30:01.561 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 1>length of time will usually their lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall apart if their prefrontal cortex is</v>

543
00:30:02.531 --> 00:30:04.430
<v Speaker 1>being damaged enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

544
00:30:04.431 --> 00:30:09.431
<v Speaker 1>So penfield was trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the brain does and so he was using </v>

545
00:30:09.431 --> 00:30:12.760
<v Speaker 1>electrodes to touch the surface and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he found,</v>

546
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.960
<v Speaker 1>if you imagine that this is the frontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of your brain here,</v>

547
00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:18.850
<v Speaker 1>and it's called that because it's at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>

548
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

549
00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.240
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a back part of it has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do more with sensory processing and then</v>

550
00:30:25.271 --> 00:30:30.271
<v Speaker 1>there's a fissure down the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on The front side of the fisher </v>

551
00:30:30.271 --> 00:30:32.150
<v Speaker 1>there's an area that's roughly triangle </v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped on the back of the fisher,</v>

552
00:30:32.151 --> 00:30:35.530
<v Speaker 1>there's another area that's roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>triangle shaped and the front part,</v>

553
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.860
<v Speaker 1>if you touch it with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an electrode like up the right </v>

554
00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.230
<v Speaker 1>current,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

555
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:46.500
<v Speaker 1>then people will report feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>something on different parts of their </v>

556
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.711
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you touch the part that's </v>

557
00:30:49.711 --> 00:30:49.711
<v Speaker 1>behind the fisher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so roughly about here,</v>

558
00:30:49.711 --> 00:30:54.151
<v Speaker 1>so then they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be inclined to move or feel the </v>

559
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:55.570
<v Speaker 1>impulse to move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>

560
00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.630
<v Speaker 1>what then feel did was draw a little map</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what parts of the brain were </v>

561
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:06.571
<v Speaker 1>connected to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sensory sensations in the body and </v>

562
00:31:06.571 --> 00:31:09.271
<v Speaker 1>what parts of the brain were contained </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to what motor sensations and </v>

563
00:31:09.271 --> 00:31:09.271
<v Speaker 1>he.</v>

564
00:31:09.271 --> 00:31:10.510
<v Speaker 1>He built this thing called a homerun </v>
<v Speaker 1>keyless.</v>

565
00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little picture and the picture is</v>

566
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.540
<v Speaker 1>of this creature that's laid out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>

567
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.390
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a dismembered body in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

568
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:24.810
<v Speaker 1>and the size of each part corresponds to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of tissue that's devoted to </v>

569
00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:26.650
<v Speaker 1>processing that brain or that bodily </v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

570
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And what you see is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting because if you look,</v>

571
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a sensory homonculus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's how your body looks to your brain</v>

572
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.990
<v Speaker 1>from a century perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a motor home oculus,</v>

573
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.420
<v Speaker 1>which is how your body looks to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain from the perspective of being able</v>

574
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:42.340
<v Speaker 1>to operate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you see for example,</v>

575
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 1>is with both the sensory and the motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>

576
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:50.250
<v Speaker 1>The hand is as big as the whole body and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thumb is as big as the rest of the </v>

577
00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:55.081
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the mouth and the tongue are </v>

578
00:31:55.081 --> 00:31:55.510
<v Speaker 1>also that big and so is the face.</v>

579
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:58.590
<v Speaker 1>So you've got this little itty bitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>body because what are you,</v>

580
00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:01.000
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with your back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

581
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.200
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't pick up anything with your </v>

582
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.221
<v Speaker 1>back and you're also not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really your sensory perception on your </v>

583
00:32:08.221 --> 00:32:12.571
<v Speaker 1>back is not very high resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I had one of you stand up and I </v>

584
00:32:12.571 --> 00:32:14.440
<v Speaker 1>put three fingers on your back this far </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart and I said,</v>

585
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:17.800
<v Speaker 1>how many fingers were there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be able to tell.</v>

586
00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 1>You'd say one probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't tell even if you space </v>

587
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.760
<v Speaker 1>them out quite a bit if you pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

588
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:29.761
<v Speaker 1>Whereas on the surface of the hand you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell immediately because this is a </v>

589
00:32:29.761 --> 00:32:33.961
<v Speaker 1>high resolution part of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course you know you can really </v>

590
00:32:33.961 --> 00:32:38.761
<v Speaker 1>move your little tentatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically appendages here and they're </v>

591
00:32:38.761 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 1>highly wired up to the brain as well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

592
00:32:39.681 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 1>very sensitive.</v>

593
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.850
<v Speaker 1>But the reason I told you all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's also particularly true with</v>

594
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:46.520
<v Speaker 1>the mouth and the and the lips and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue.</v>

595
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.640
<v Speaker 1>And then also the entire face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your face is extraordinarily </v>

596
00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.560
<v Speaker 1>mobile and you broadcast emotion with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and so it's a,</v>

597
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:58.520
<v Speaker 1>it's a communication device of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest order and so it has to be really</v>

598
00:32:58.521 --> 00:33:01.520
<v Speaker 1>wired up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have so much neuro control over your</v>

599
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:06.521
<v Speaker 1>face that you can actually teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to fire single neurons in the </v>

600
00:33:06.521 --> 00:33:10.481
<v Speaker 1>tissue underneath your eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So which you certainly not going to be </v>

601
00:33:10.481 --> 00:33:10.481
<v Speaker 1>able to do with your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

602
00:33:10.481 --> 00:33:13.490
<v Speaker 1>well why would you anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now,</v>

603
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.910
<v Speaker 1>so what I tell you that in part so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get some more understanding of how </v>

604
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 1>the child is wired up because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>

605
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.680
<v Speaker 1>tongue lip sort of arrangement that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

606
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:29.770
<v Speaker 1>that the baby is born with is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful learning circuit and it's </v>

607
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:32.450
<v Speaker 1>established quite nicely right at birth.</v>

608
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And so then the baby can start exploring</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world using parts of it that are </v>

609
00:33:37.971 --> 00:33:41.120
<v Speaker 1>already there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a big chunk of that is the mouth.</v>

610
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

611
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.560
<v Speaker 1>you know how this works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you have recently had dental </v>

612
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:52.091
<v Speaker 1>surgery of one form or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least you can remember when you </v>

613
00:33:52.091 --> 00:33:54.971
<v Speaker 1>had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you had a tooth pulled or a </v>

614
00:33:54.971 --> 00:33:55.670
<v Speaker 1>filling or you had racist put in or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

615
00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:01.090
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you'll notice if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose a tooth isn't your damn tommy's</v>

616
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.580
<v Speaker 1>in there where the tooth was for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next six months.</v>

617
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fiddling around and you can do it </v>

618
00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:09.670
<v Speaker 1>consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you will sometimes,</v>

619
00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.621
<v Speaker 1>but even if you're not attending to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your tongue will be in there checking </v>

620
00:34:14.621 --> 00:34:16.460
<v Speaker 1>out every tiny little crack and crevice </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the new area.</v>

621
00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:21.461
<v Speaker 1>And what it's doing is updating your map</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the map of your body because your </v>

622
00:34:21.461 --> 00:34:24.200
<v Speaker 1>mouth wants to know what part of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and what part of it isn't.</v>

623
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to chew the parts </v>

624
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:29.200
<v Speaker 1>that are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second of all,</v>

625
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.710
<v Speaker 1>if there's any foreign body in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>

626
00:34:30.711 --> 00:34:35.711
<v Speaker 1>obviously you want to get that out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for endless numbers of reasons so </v>

627
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:41.530
<v Speaker 1>you can detect surface variation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your lips and tongue with tremendous </v>

628
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:42.290
<v Speaker 1>accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

629
00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.400
<v Speaker 1>you know there's all sorts of uses that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people put that ability to.</v>

630
00:34:46.401 --> 00:34:51.401
<v Speaker 1>It's also one of the ways that people a </v>
<v Speaker 1>test each other out for sexual </v>

631
00:34:51.401 --> 00:34:52.040
<v Speaker 1>compatibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

632
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Because that's all mouth and tongue work</v>
<v Speaker 1>rough.</v>

633
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Not all of it obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least some reasonable proportion </v>

634
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.130
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's also a part of exploratory</v>

635
00:35:01.131 --> 00:35:03.920
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're testing for things like health</v>

636
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.540
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

637
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 1>with kissing smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

638
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:09.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a major part of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:14.740
<v Speaker 1>and not only is it the part that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you explore the world with so that </v>

640
00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.400
<v Speaker 1>you can figure out what to eat and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to eat,</v>

641
00:35:16.401 --> 00:35:19.700
<v Speaker 1>which is a big problem for omnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

642
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Because we can eat damn near anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a complex cognitive problem,</v>

643
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:28.370
<v Speaker 1>but you also can use it as a tool for </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring the contours of the world.</v>

644
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Now animals really do that with smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

645
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Because your typical animal is a smell </v>
<v Speaker 1>based creature.</v>

646
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Whereas human beings aren't really so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much that probably because we became and</v>

647
00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Speaker 1>for a bunch of other reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but smell is a tremendously powerful </v>

648
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 1>modality and it's pretty much fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

649
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:47.880
<v Speaker 1>At birth as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

650
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Speaker 1>mothers report that they can distinguish</v>
<v Speaker 1>their baby by smell of virtually,</v>

651
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a day or two after they're born and they</v>

652
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:59.031
<v Speaker 1>know what the smell and babies can </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly smell their mothers and their </v>

653
00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:00.570
<v Speaker 1>fathers as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take very long at all.</v>

654
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:06.230
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby's got its mouth and so it can </v>

655
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 1>start getting somewhere with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's also got basic reflexes,</v>

656
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:13.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now what a baby does in some sense </v>

657
00:36:13.191 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 1>is if it starts developing from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle and the top downward and outward.</v>

658
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.000
<v Speaker 1>So the mouth and the nose are all wired </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

659
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I start to get wired up fairly quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not much to begin with because </v>

660
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:29.391
<v Speaker 1>the baby will move its eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>independently and it's not very good at </v>

661
00:36:29.391 --> 00:36:32.160
<v Speaker 1>focusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's focal length is actually,</v>

662
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:37.161
<v Speaker 1>it's natural focal length is pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the distance from breast to </v>

663
00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:38.130
<v Speaker 1>mothers are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes perfect sense,</v>

664
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:43.131
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the baby wants to be able to </v>

665
00:36:43.131 --> 00:36:43.620
<v Speaker 1>communicate extraordinarily well to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce a bond with the mother.</v>

666
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.970
<v Speaker 1>And that happens most frequently with </v>
<v Speaker 1>during breastfeeding,</v>

667
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
<v Speaker 1>which is also extremely good for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby because the baby gets touched and </v>

668
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.000
<v Speaker 1>babies really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

669
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.870
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really need to be touched.</v>

670
00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.030
<v Speaker 1>If you don't touch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they die.</v>

671
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:02.510
<v Speaker 1>So even if you feed them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelter them in all those sorts of </v>

672
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.510
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be touched and it's,</v>

673
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.630
<v Speaker 1>it's very good for the baby's </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

674
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.690
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby starts out with it's,</v>

675
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:12.990
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its ability to explore with its mouth </v>

676
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.311
<v Speaker 1>and its tongue in its and its ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell and that it starts to develop its </v>

677
00:37:16.311 --> 00:37:20.151
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does that in concert with </v>

678
00:37:20.151 --> 00:37:20.151
<v Speaker 1>developing other parts of its body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

679
00:37:20.151 --> 00:37:23.550
<v Speaker 1>So the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put the baby on its stomach,</v>

680
00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:26.250
<v Speaker 1>then it starts to exercise its ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lift up.</v>

681
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:26.510
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

682
00:37:26.511 --> 00:37:31.511
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of gets that going and it </v>

683
00:37:31.511 --> 00:37:31.511
<v Speaker 1>starts to learn how to use its arms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>its legs.</v>

684
00:37:31.511 --> 00:37:34.440
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one thing you can do for a baby</v>

685
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.410
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help and get going.</v>

686
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:45.020
<v Speaker 1>So let's say the baby's in its crib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's laying face upward.</v>

687
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can give it a mobile.</v>

688
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:50.730
<v Speaker 1>How if you go into a baby store and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at mobile,</v>

689
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.710
<v Speaker 1>what you'll see as maybe the top part is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to coat hangers,</v>

690
00:37:54.711 --> 00:37:59.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cross and then there's </v>

691
00:37:59.711 --> 00:37:59.930
<v Speaker 1>things hanging from it and the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be,</v>

692
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're cute.</v>

693
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Who knows hello kitty things or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn thing like that,</v>

694
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're facing you.</v>

695
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a stupid mobile because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't the person who's supposed to be </v>

696
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:16.670
<v Speaker 1>looking at the hello kitty thinks the </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby's supposed to be looking at it.</v>

697
00:38:16.671 --> 00:38:19.250
<v Speaker 1>So those should be facing down and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>never are.</v>

698
00:38:19.251 --> 00:38:22.250
<v Speaker 1>They're always facing sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the baby looks at all it sees is</v>

699
00:38:22.251 --> 00:38:27.251
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of horizontal lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume that you're reasonably </v>

700
00:38:27.251 --> 00:38:31.661
<v Speaker 1>bright and you get one that the baby can</v>
<v Speaker 1>see and then maybe it should be black </v>

701
00:38:31.661 --> 00:38:35.861
<v Speaker 1>and white or at least really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bright primary colors because </v>

702
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:36.500
<v Speaker 1>it's easier for baby could detect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>black and white.</v>

703
00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:41.500
<v Speaker 1>It's really good because baby is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at detecting edges and so that </v>

704
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.640
<v Speaker 1>thing will move around the baby lay </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and watch it,</v>

705
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.920
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and babies,</v>

706
00:38:44.921 --> 00:38:49.921
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they kind of look like they're </v>

707
00:38:49.921 --> 00:38:51.691
<v Speaker 1>stoned on lsd and I actually think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's technically correct because one </v>

708
00:38:52.781 --> 00:38:57.781
<v Speaker 1>of the things that hallucinogens do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced the inhibiting power of memory </v>

709
00:38:58.301 --> 00:39:03.301
<v Speaker 1>on perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course babies have no inhibiting </v>

710
00:39:03.301 --> 00:39:05.060
<v Speaker 1>power of memory on perception because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no memory.</v>

711
00:39:05.061 --> 00:39:09.790
<v Speaker 1>So there are pretty much completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by the world all the time.</v>

712
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.210
<v Speaker 1>so they laying there watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile and you know,</v>

713
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.660
<v Speaker 1>you can shake it and maybe they'll have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little reflex at that or,</v>

714
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.960
<v Speaker 1>or you can interact with somebody in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby will start checking that out and </v>

715
00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.621
<v Speaker 1>we'll watch it and watch watching to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch party so that it can get its eyes </v>

716
00:39:25.661 --> 00:39:26.410
<v Speaker 1>organized.</v>

717
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.280
<v Speaker 1>And it does that in concert to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree with its motor ability,</v>

718
00:39:30.281 --> 00:39:31.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>

719
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:36.400
<v Speaker 1>imagine your cross side a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the baby and you're looking at that</v>

720
00:39:36.401 --> 00:39:38.980
<v Speaker 1>thing and there's two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

721
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:40.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know there's not two of them?</v>

722
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to whack it with your hand as </v>

723
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.341
<v Speaker 1>soon as you walk with your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find out if it's one </v>

724
00:39:50.341 --> 00:39:52.801
<v Speaker 1>thing or two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you figure out whether that's one </v>

725
00:39:52.801 --> 00:39:52.801
<v Speaker 1>arm or two arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

726
00:39:52.801 --> 00:39:56.700
<v Speaker 1>and so the baby is starting to to whack </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself against the world and watched the</v>

727
00:39:56.771 --> 00:40:01.771
<v Speaker 1>consequences to help it start to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>up its ability to interact with the </v>

728
00:40:01.771 --> 00:40:02.350
<v Speaker 1>world and its ability to model the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

729
00:40:02.351 --> 00:40:04.870
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

730
00:40:04.871 --> 00:40:08.020
<v Speaker 1>if you put a baby in the crib and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a mobile there,</v>

731
00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:13.140
<v Speaker 1>you want to kind of move to mobile down </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it's close enough so that the </v>

732
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:13.660
<v Speaker 1>baby might be able to bump it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies,</v>

733
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:15.250
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't swaddle them,</v>

734
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.570
<v Speaker 1>they lay there and their hands and legs </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of float in space like this.</v>

735
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.030
<v Speaker 1>And It's because they're not really very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well connected to them.</v>

736
00:40:22.031 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's why a baby will poke itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and die now.</v>

737
00:40:24.071 --> 00:40:29.071
<v Speaker 1>And then with his thumb and it's rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>amusing to watch and it kind of bleak </v>

738
00:40:29.071 --> 00:40:32.581
<v Speaker 1>manner be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a baby will lay there and it'll poke </v>

739
00:40:32.581 --> 00:40:35.331
<v Speaker 1>itself and will go like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what it's just discovered is that </v>

740
00:40:35.331 --> 00:40:38.680
<v Speaker 1>there's some relationship between that </v>
<v Speaker 1>random movement and that sensation.</v>

741
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

742
00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:45.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say it's laying there and it's </v>

743
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:47.461
<v Speaker 1>floating around in space and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate enough so that it's leg comes </v>

744
00:40:48.131 --> 00:40:50.360
<v Speaker 1>into contact with an element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile.</v>

745
00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Well that will make the mobile do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something interesting and novel.</v>

746
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.040
<v Speaker 1>And when the bait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the mobile,</v>

747
00:40:57.041 --> 00:41:02.041
<v Speaker 1>that's something interesting and novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>that triggers a reflex and the baby and </v>

748
00:41:02.041 --> 00:41:03.700
<v Speaker 1>the and the reflex is that the baby will</v>
<v Speaker 1>orient towards it and look.</v>

749
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And so for piaget that was the circuit.</v>

750
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:12.480
<v Speaker 1>That was the beginning of the baby's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to sort of start bootstrapping </v>

751
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.951
<v Speaker 1>it up in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thought what you needed was the </v>

752
00:41:16.951 --> 00:41:20.011
<v Speaker 1>ability to move a little bit at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that'd be the reflex say or even </v>

753
00:41:20.011 --> 00:41:24.691
<v Speaker 1>randomness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you needed the ability to </v>

754
00:41:24.691 --> 00:41:27.511
<v Speaker 1>refine that movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you needed to be able to practice it </v>

755
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:32.020
<v Speaker 1>and you need it to be able to improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>with practice and you need it to be able</v>

756
00:41:32.021 --> 00:41:37.021
<v Speaker 1>to imitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And warming of the things that piaget </v>

757
00:41:37.021 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is so smart,</v>

758
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it's so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a lot of what babies did was </v>

759
00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.330
<v Speaker 1>imitate themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

760
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:49.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're laying in bed and they're </v>

761
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:49.600
<v Speaker 1>starting to get some sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection between,</v>

762
00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 1>of how their arms and legs work and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can maybe make,</v>

763
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:55.280
<v Speaker 1>start to make sort of broad gestures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>

764
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:58.880
<v Speaker 1>but now and then they are lucky in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of flinging your arms around them,</v>

765
00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:03.890
<v Speaker 1>they hit them all bile and they'd get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little reflex out of that if it's a </v>

766
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.901
<v Speaker 1>startle and an indication of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll sit there and practice </v>

767
00:42:07.901 --> 00:42:09.710
<v Speaker 1>how to whack that thing with their hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what.</v>

768
00:42:09.711 --> 00:42:14.711
<v Speaker 1>So what they're doing is they kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally produced a phenomena of </v>

769
00:42:15.381 --> 00:42:20.381
<v Speaker 1>interest and they noted the consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what they do is try to </v>

770
00:42:20.381 --> 00:42:24.581
<v Speaker 1>reduplicate the phenomena of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically what they're doing is </v>

771
00:42:24.581 --> 00:42:28.430
<v Speaker 1>manifest in different patterns of quasi </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily read reflex plaza,</v>

772
00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:33.930
<v Speaker 1>involuntary reflex of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if that produces something of </v>

773
00:42:34.371 --> 00:42:36.380
<v Speaker 1>note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll practice imitating it.</v>

774
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:42.310
<v Speaker 1>So when my daughter was about 18 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not even at all,</v>

775
00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.540
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 months,</v>

776
00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:53.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe old enough to sit up anyways and </v>
<v Speaker 1>old enough to start to do some things by</v>

777
00:42:53.681 --> 00:42:56.050
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We bought her these books.</v>

778
00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.010
<v Speaker 1>They were disney books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcover cardboard books,</v>

779
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five pages long or something.</v>

780
00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Each of the pages was quite thick </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was made out of cardboard and</v>

781
00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:10.820
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four of them would come in a little box </v>

782
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:11.290
<v Speaker 1>which is about four inches high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>about an inch and a half wide.</v>

783
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:16.890
<v Speaker 1>And if you really careful you could take</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the books and then you can put all </v>

784
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:21.541
<v Speaker 1>of them back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that easy because the first </v>

785
00:43:21.541 --> 00:43:22.210
<v Speaker 1>one wasn't too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they got,</v>

786
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently more difficult as you kept </v>

787
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:28.960
<v Speaker 1>putting each of the men because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parameters of the exercise changed.</v>

788
00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.350
<v Speaker 1>And she must have spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

789
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:37.540
<v Speaker 1>150 hours dumping those out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picking them up,</v>

790
00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:39.940
<v Speaker 1>putting them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

791
00:43:39.941 --> 00:43:41.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was she doing?</v>

792
00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:42.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

793
00:43:42.851 --> 00:43:45.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was putting books in a box.</v>

794
00:43:45.071 --> 00:43:47.200
<v Speaker 1>That's not what she was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

795
00:43:47.201 --> 00:43:50.830
<v Speaker 1>they weren't books to her and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>a box because she didn't know what a box</v>

796
00:43:50.831 --> 00:43:55.831
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she was doing was practicing going </v>

797
00:43:55.831 --> 00:43:55.831
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

798
00:43:55.831 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and matching the size of something to,</v>

799
00:43:57.321 --> 00:44:02.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the size of something else and not </v>

800
00:44:02.321 --> 00:44:02.321
<v Speaker 1>very complicated and maybe you know,</v>

801
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:08.580
<v Speaker 1>so there is a jar of apple juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>OkaY.</v>

802
00:44:08.581 --> 00:44:10.380
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well pick that up.</v>

803
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you can pick it up like this.</v>

804
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.910
<v Speaker 1>You can pick it up like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pick it up like this,</v>

805
00:44:14.911 --> 00:44:19.911
<v Speaker 1>you can pick it up like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of things to </v>

806
00:44:19.911 --> 00:44:22.971
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And each of those movements is a </v>

807
00:44:22.971 --> 00:44:25.491
<v Speaker 1>different sensory motor capacity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has an incredibly wide range of </v>

808
00:44:26.941 --> 00:44:31.941
<v Speaker 1>potential applications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a child will sit there and fiddle </v>

809
00:44:31.941 --> 00:44:35.661
<v Speaker 1>about their hands in their arms and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of their body for untold hours </v>

810
00:44:35.661 --> 00:44:40.131
<v Speaker 1>because what they're doing is building </v>
<v Speaker 1>up these basic sensory motor systems </v>

811
00:44:40.131 --> 00:44:41.760
<v Speaker 1>from the bottom up so that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

812
00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:46.810
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they practice them in one domain </v>

813
00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.861
<v Speaker 1>where there's some challenge and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're starting to build new </v>

814
00:44:48.861 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Speaker 1>exploratory tools that they can go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and practice on the rest of the world.</v>

815
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.170
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you can grip a,</v>

816
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd say once you can grip a mobile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can let go,</v>

817
00:44:58.321 --> 00:45:03.321
<v Speaker 1>which is something babies actually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hard time doing because they have a </v>

818
00:45:03.321 --> 00:45:03.810
<v Speaker 1>grip reflex and they're quite strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're first born.</v>

819
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.970
<v Speaker 1>If you put your fingers in their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can lift them right off the ground,</v>

820
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:12.980
<v Speaker 1>the cling to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably old chimpanzee </v>

821
00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.280
<v Speaker 1>gripping behavior because chimps grabbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their mothers first and then they're </v>

822
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.310
<v Speaker 1>like carried around like that for about </v>
<v Speaker 1>three years now.</v>

823
00:45:17.311 --> 00:45:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Since you don't have much for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of useless for the baby,</v>

824
00:45:20.341 --> 00:45:25.341
<v Speaker 1>although they're pretty good at getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>your hair and your glasses and your </v>

825
00:45:25.341 --> 00:45:28.341
<v Speaker 1>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you got to get them to let </v>

826
00:45:28.341 --> 00:45:28.341
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

827
00:45:28.341 --> 00:45:30.510
<v Speaker 1>they'll sit there and practice all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>little sub routines.</v>

828
00:45:30.511 --> 00:45:32.850
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll see this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a baby,</v>

829
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:38.930
<v Speaker 1>you got your baby in the highchair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's nine months old and you're </v>

830
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.931
<v Speaker 1>trying to feed the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is often very challenging because </v>

831
00:45:41.931 --> 00:45:46.221
<v Speaker 1>babies are very curious and annoying and</v>
<v Speaker 1>troublesome and tough and ordinary and </v>

832
00:45:46.221 --> 00:45:50.780
<v Speaker 1>exploratory and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and misbehaving and provocative and all </v>

833
00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 1>those things because they need that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn about the world.</v>

834
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:57.560
<v Speaker 1>And they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do something like maybe they'll </v>

835
00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.870
<v Speaker 1>eat and they'll drop the spoon and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>will go in the floor and they think,</v>

836
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity,</v>

837
00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:04.860
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you'll give them their,</v>

838
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>their spoon again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the first thing they'll do is take </v>

839
00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.321
<v Speaker 1>their food and finding it on the floor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll do that launch because </v>

840
00:46:12.321 --> 00:46:15.951
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of interested in this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>twisting the spoon and having things </v>

841
00:46:16.021 --> 00:46:21.021
<v Speaker 1>fall on the floor phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's part of the reason why it's </v>

842
00:46:21.021 --> 00:46:21.600
<v Speaker 1>often hard to feed babies is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they're hungry,</v>

843
00:46:21.601 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 1>you feed them three things and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not starving.</v>

844
00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:25.970
<v Speaker 1>And then they're so hyper curious that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna,</v>

845
00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:27.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to do something else.</v>

846
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they're doing is they're,</v>

847
00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:35.620
<v Speaker 1>they're continually utilizing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic reflexive behavior and building </v>

848
00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:41.330
<v Speaker 1>more and more complex structures up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the basis of that and with each time </v>

849
00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:45.741
<v Speaker 1>they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it opens up a new toolbox for them and </v>

850
00:46:45.741 --> 00:46:48.171
<v Speaker 1>they know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expand outward and start to interact </v>

851
00:46:48.171 --> 00:46:50.781
<v Speaker 1>with the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one way also of </v>

852
00:46:50.781 --> 00:46:54.441
<v Speaker 1>understanding where a baby's personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from.</v>

853
00:46:57.830 --> 00:47:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Ali's is complicated because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about babies that are sort of</v>

854
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:08.760
<v Speaker 1>their parameters of personality or </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat determined at birth.</v>

855
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.990
<v Speaker 1>So I'll tell you how I conceptualized </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

856
00:47:12.991 --> 00:47:17.991
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how you might conceptualize the </v>

857
00:47:17.991 --> 00:47:20.121
<v Speaker 1>relationship between nature and nurture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is a good metaphor </v>

858
00:47:20.121 --> 00:47:24.231
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the most elegant metaphor in </v>

859
00:47:24.231 --> 00:47:24.231
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's worked for me.</v>

860
00:47:24.231 --> 00:47:28.640
<v Speaker 1>So imagine for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a baby at three months of age can </v>

861
00:47:30.491 --> 00:47:33.910
<v Speaker 1>be a corn baby or nervous baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that is the case.</v>

862
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:38.911
<v Speaker 1>We know that even right at birth you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could kind of figure out whether a baby </v>

863
00:47:38.911 --> 00:47:40.810
<v Speaker 1>is a baby or or nervous paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's neuroticism.</v>

864
00:47:40.811 --> 00:47:43.210
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental dimension of </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>

865
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:49.050
<v Speaker 1>So you might say that one baby's nervous</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior might have this range and </v>

866
00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:53.821
<v Speaker 1>another baby's nervous behavior might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this range and another baby's </v>

867
00:47:53.821 --> 00:47:57.200
<v Speaker 1>nervous behavior by cab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this range and most of the time it sort </v>

868
00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.481
<v Speaker 1>of in the middle of that range and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it'll manifest behaviors that </v>

869
00:48:00.481 --> 00:48:02.710
<v Speaker 1>are associated with what's extreme for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

870
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:07.710
<v Speaker 1>So even if you have a calm baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it'll get upset and even if </v>

871
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:08.680
<v Speaker 1>you have a baby that's always upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it will be caught.</v>

872
00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:14.640
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well to what degree can you modulate the</v>

873
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:20.521
<v Speaker 1>baby's nervous behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you want to have more calm </v>

874
00:48:20.521 --> 00:48:21.760
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're going to do some things to</v>

875
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:26.790
<v Speaker 1>make that baby calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is how much transformation </v>

876
00:48:27.281 --> 00:48:32.281
<v Speaker 1>can you make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answered that to some degree is </v>

877
00:48:32.281 --> 00:48:35.241
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how much effort you make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some changes that are close to the </v>

878
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.850
<v Speaker 1>average of the baby's natural curve of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responses are fairly easy to make.</v>

879
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:43.450
<v Speaker 1>So you can shift the baby a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards being more calm without too much</v>

880
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:46.570
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to shift it more towards</v>

881
00:48:46.571 --> 00:48:51.571
<v Speaker 1>being calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to take more work and </v>

882
00:48:51.571 --> 00:48:51.571
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to shift it more to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>calm,</v>

883
00:48:51.571 --> 00:48:53.380
<v Speaker 1>that's going to take more work and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not linear.</v>

884
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is at some point you </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of reach a practIcal limit.</v>

885
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:02.110
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to make your baby more </v>
<v Speaker 1>calm than you know.</v>

886
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:07.111
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could move it one standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation or two standard deviations </v>

887
00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:07.930
<v Speaker 1>from its natural</v>

888
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:12.810
<v Speaker 1>resting place when it was first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it first emerged as a creature.</v>

889
00:49:12.811 --> 00:49:16.830
<v Speaker 1>But if you're going to move it three to </v>
<v Speaker 1>three standard deviations from the fifth</v>

890
00:49:16.831 --> 00:49:20.040
<v Speaker 1>percentile to the 95th percentile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be working out.</v>

891
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:22.120
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else with the baby.</v>

892
00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:27.410
<v Speaker 1>So you can start to conceptualize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between nature and nurture </v>

893
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:30.210
<v Speaker 1>as a cost relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

894
00:49:30.211 --> 00:49:32.790
<v Speaker 1>iq is quite stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can move iq,</v>

895
00:49:32.791 --> 00:49:36.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's really expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a practical limit to it.</v>

896
00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:41.540
<v Speaker 1>So I think if you take twins that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>adopted out at birth in order to get a </v>

897
00:49:42.451 --> 00:49:45.270
<v Speaker 1>15 point difference in iq between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>twins,</v>

898
00:49:45.271 --> 00:49:50.271
<v Speaker 1>by the time they become adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one twin has to be at the 95th </v>

899
00:49:50.271 --> 00:49:54.081
<v Speaker 1>percentile for wealth in their family </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other twin has to be at the </v>

900
00:49:54.081 --> 00:49:55.560
<v Speaker 1>fifth percentile for wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a massive difference,</v>

901
00:49:55.561 --> 00:49:56.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

902
00:49:56.641 --> 00:50:01.641
<v Speaker 1>And so it's such a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to produce that with </v>

903
00:50:01.641 --> 00:50:04.971
<v Speaker 1>any degree of ease in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so environmental transformations of </v>

904
00:50:05.281 --> 00:50:07.230
<v Speaker 1>biological parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost,</v>

905
00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.150
<v Speaker 1>that's a very useful way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

906
00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.550
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

907
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:13.140
<v Speaker 1>back to the baby.</v>

908
00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

909
00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:24.390
<v Speaker 1>the baby is starting to organize itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the bottom up.</v>

910
00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:29.720
<v Speaker 1>And so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's kind of a way to about how that </v>

911
00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.281
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piaget pointed out that this is quite </v>

912
00:50:33.281 --> 00:50:34.340
<v Speaker 1>well known in the development </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>

913
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:39.730
<v Speaker 1>that babies that are younger than three </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really play well with others and </v>

914
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated because they can play </v>
<v Speaker 1>some things with others.</v>

915
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:52.601
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can play peekaboo quite well with </v>

916
00:50:52.601 --> 00:50:52.601
<v Speaker 1>the nine month old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

917
00:50:52.601 --> 00:50:57.370
<v Speaker 1>so there's some sorts of simple games </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that babies can play with you </v>

918
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 1>pretty much as soon as they get their </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes focused.</v>

919
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And one of the funny things about babies</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're very young,</v>

920
00:51:03.981 --> 00:51:08.981
<v Speaker 1>even below nine months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they already have a sense of </v>

921
00:51:08.981 --> 00:51:11.021
<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something I've never been able </v>

922
00:51:11.021 --> 00:51:13.211
<v Speaker 1>to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can play a little comical games </v>

923
00:51:13.211 --> 00:51:15.971
<v Speaker 1>with you as soon as you're smart enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what the baby's up to </v>

924
00:51:15.971 --> 00:51:16.170
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking as they.</v>

925
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:21.170
<v Speaker 1>They appreciate humor absurdly early and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to understand why.</v>

926
00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.360
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

927
00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:28.960
<v Speaker 1>The psg eddie and idea was in some sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what the baby does to begin with </v>

928
00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.610
<v Speaker 1>his first plays games with itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's exploring,</v>

929
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:36.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it produces some phenomena of </v>

930
00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:37.040
<v Speaker 1>interest and then it replicates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>until it masters it.</v>

931
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:42.041
<v Speaker 1>And then it just keeps doing that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to be more and more and more </v>

932
00:51:42.041 --> 00:51:42.470
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time it's about three,</v>

933
00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:48.070
<v Speaker 1>it's complex enough so that all of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>little microsystems are kind of </v>

934
00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:49.110
<v Speaker 1>integrated into one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

935
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:51.710
<v Speaker 1>so it's got a set of routines for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry.</v>

936
00:51:51.711 --> 00:51:53.750
<v Speaker 1>It's got a set of routines for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious,</v>

937
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:56.120
<v Speaker 1>it's got a set of routines for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploratory,</v>

938
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:01.420
<v Speaker 1>it's got a set of routines for seeking </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention from its parent and so on.</v>

939
00:52:01.611 --> 00:52:06.611
<v Speaker 1>And then it starting to build some </v>
<v Speaker 1>overarching unity among all of those </v>

940
00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:12.100
<v Speaker 1>micro processes so that it can segue </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoothly between them.</v>

941
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.390
<v Speaker 1>And you can really see this starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen at two because you know,</v>

942
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:21.430
<v Speaker 1>you've heard of the terrible twos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens in the terrible two's is </v>

943
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:22.660
<v Speaker 1>that the child is still fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>unintegrated.</v>

944
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:27.700
<v Speaker 1>so they'll go there quite a riot to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>around because they're staggeringly </v>

945
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:27.700
<v Speaker 1>emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

946
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.310
<v Speaker 1>they'll go from Guinea beyond belief to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crying outrageously,</v>

947
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:36.311
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So angry that if you ever saw an adult </v>

948
00:52:36.311 --> 00:52:38.861
<v Speaker 1>that angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd immediately run away and call the </v>

949
00:52:38.861 --> 00:52:39.260
<v Speaker 1>police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can do that like in 15 minuteS.</v>

950
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.360
<v Speaker 1>They just cycle through these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

951
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:42.760
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>

952
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:47.790
<v Speaker 1>and weirdly enough adults will notice </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors or they'll see behaviors in </v>

953
00:52:48.651 --> 00:52:53.651
<v Speaker 1>children that would be absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>outrageous and adults and they don't </v>

954
00:52:53.651 --> 00:52:54.500
<v Speaker 1>even really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't phase them at all.</v>

955
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:57.050
<v Speaker 1>It shows you how well adapted we already</v>
<v Speaker 1>children because you know,</v>

956
00:52:57.290 --> 00:53:00.170
<v Speaker 1>a child who's having a tantrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the child is good at it,</v>

957
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll fling themselves onto the floor,</v>

958
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.120
<v Speaker 1>which you rarely see an adult do.</v>

959
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:10.510
<v Speaker 1>And then the pound and kick and scream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if they're really good at it </v>

960
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:12.440
<v Speaker 1>and some of them get really amazingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at it,</v>

961
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.170
<v Speaker 1>they'll hold their breath until they </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn blue and pass out.</v>

962
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:18.250
<v Speaker 1>So I try that one night when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

963
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:21.680
<v Speaker 1>when you don't have anything to do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your color is off,</v>

964
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:26.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just see if you can kick and scream on </v>

965
00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:27.750
<v Speaker 1>the floor for awhile and then hold your </v>
<v Speaker 1>breath until you turn blue and pass out.</v>

966
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:32.070
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that just shows you how committed to</v>

967
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:37.071
<v Speaker 1>the tantrum a child can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy to stop that sort of </v>

968
00:53:37.071 --> 00:53:41.931
<v Speaker 1>behavior by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if your child throws a tantrum that </v>

969
00:53:41.931 --> 00:53:45.410
<v Speaker 1>said home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go away and then eventually the </v>

970
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:49.161
<v Speaker 1>child will turn blue and pass out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll come to and there isn't </v>

971
00:53:49.161 --> 00:53:50.240
<v Speaker 1>anyone there and that's not really an </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting outcomes.</v>

972
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:55.240
<v Speaker 1>So if you do that two or three times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child usually figures out that it's </v>

973
00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:55.300
<v Speaker 1>really not worth the hassle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want him to choke,</v>

974
00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:00.320
<v Speaker 1>to continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait until they turn blue and pass out </v>

975
00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Speaker 1>and then really freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you could do that randomly</v>

976
00:54:01.861 --> 00:54:02.850
<v Speaker 1>a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

977
00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:05.610
<v Speaker 1>you'll get that child just having </v>
<v Speaker 1>tantrums,</v>

978
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.190
<v Speaker 1>turning blue and passing out pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

979
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.650
<v Speaker 1>So don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

980
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:13.750
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>

981
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:17.670
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the got and idea in some sense is the</v>

982
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 1>child builds up these little reflexes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and these little,</v>

983
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:25.820
<v Speaker 1>we'll call them subpersonalities because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a better way of thinking about it </v>

984
00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.210
<v Speaker 1>and it starts to build them around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modern psychologists would think more </v>

985
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:32.670
<v Speaker 1>thAt it starts to build them around </v>
<v Speaker 1>motIvational systems.</v>

986
00:54:32.671 --> 00:54:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Piaget would necessarily say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

987
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000
<v Speaker 1>and then at some point the child starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to enter the social world.</v>

988
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Now it's simple in some ways to think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child before three is not social and</v>

989
00:54:46.681 --> 00:54:51.420
<v Speaker 1>then the child after three is social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really accurate,</v>

990
00:54:51.421 --> 00:54:53.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you think about it,</v>

991
00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:59.120
<v Speaker 1>the child is being social right from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of its development because </v>

992
00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.210
<v Speaker 1>first of all it has to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

993
00:55:00.211 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 1>how to feed even if it's not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfed.</v>

994
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:07.640
<v Speaker 1>It Has to figure out how to participate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a playful and social manner around </v>

995
00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:13.041
<v Speaker 1>feeding and that's particularly the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the child has to breastfeed because </v>

996
00:55:13.041 --> 00:55:15.060
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding is very complex process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

997
00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:17.520
<v Speaker 1>you have to get the mother to cooperate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't fight her,</v>

998
00:55:17.521 --> 00:55:22.521
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's all sorts of rules about </v>

999
00:55:22.521 --> 00:55:25.071
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding that the baby has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow and so the babies actually </v>

1000
00:55:25.071 --> 00:55:28.221
<v Speaker 1>entering into fairly complex social </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships in games right from the </v>

1001
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:33.920
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's especially true if it also </v>

1002
00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.390
<v Speaker 1>has siblings because if you have a baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe have a two year old,</v>

1003
00:55:34.391 --> 00:55:39.391
<v Speaker 1>the two year old and the baby are </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing right off the bat and they're </v>

1004
00:55:39.391 --> 00:55:40.380
<v Speaker 1>two year olds are amazingly good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing with newborns.</v>

1005
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:45.890
<v Speaker 1>It's quite staggering to watch them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're thinking about having </v>

1006
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:46.200
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also recommend not just having one</v>

1007
00:55:46.201 --> 00:55:51.201
<v Speaker 1>because one child is way more work than </v>
<v Speaker 1>three because you have to amuse one </v>

1008
00:55:51.201 --> 00:55:52.680
<v Speaker 1>child all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you have three,</v>

1009
00:55:52.681 --> 00:55:54.910
<v Speaker 1>you can ignore them completely and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just raise each other.</v>

1010
00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:58.770
<v Speaker 1>It's actually much better for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

1011
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're there not to make sure</v>

1012
00:56:00.281 --> 00:56:02.430
<v Speaker 1>that they don't lie to each other on </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and that sort of thing,</v>

1013
00:56:02.431 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 1>which is your basically your jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay.</v>

1014
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:10.550
<v Speaker 1>But we'll ask for the time being as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the child isn't social till three </v>

1015
00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 1>because that's simplification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a useful one.</v>

1016
00:56:12.481 --> 00:56:17.481
<v Speaker 1>So piaget was also extremely interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in how the child became social and I </v>

1017
00:56:19.591 --> 00:56:23.330
<v Speaker 1>think apart from his ideas about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1018
00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:26.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self generation of the baby from the</v>

1019
00:56:26.171 --> 00:56:30.450
<v Speaker 1>bottom upwards using its own reflexes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its own capacity to be explored.</v>

1020
00:56:30.451 --> 00:56:33.670
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that piaget was </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily good at</v>

1021
00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:41.540
<v Speaker 1>laying out and andy and remarkable at </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovering what's the role of games.</v>

1022
00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:47.840
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologist,</v>

1023
00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who discovered just how important it is </v>

1024
00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.860
<v Speaker 1>to have kids play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1025
00:56:55.861 --> 00:56:59.730
<v Speaker 1>the problem with players that it's fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so utilitarian people,</v>

1026
00:56:59.731 --> 00:57:01.740
<v Speaker 1>especially ones that are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>

1027
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.980
<v Speaker 1>have this idea that if it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't really be good for you.</v>

1028
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And so because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role of play in children was not and</v>

1029
00:57:11.131 --> 00:57:15.450
<v Speaker 1>still isn't appreciated in the full </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of its importance.</v>

1030
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:17.270
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1031
00:57:17.271 --> 00:57:19.890
<v Speaker 1>we take the kids that are in grade one </v>
<v Speaker 1>there like six,</v>

1032
00:57:19.891 --> 00:57:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing for them?</v>

1033
00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.490
<v Speaker 1>We put them in chairs like the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in,</v>

1034
00:57:23.491 --> 00:57:26.190
<v Speaker 1>you've been in that damn chair for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>16 years,</v>

1035
00:57:26.191 --> 00:57:31.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like we take those little </v>

1036
00:57:31.191 --> 00:57:33.560
<v Speaker 1>characters and we put them in chairs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we expect them to sit there and listen </v>

1037
00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.360
<v Speaker 1>to adults for six hours a day while </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1038
00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.160
<v Speaker 1>it's so idiotic that it's beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehension.</v>

1039
00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:40.500
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder tHe little gliders are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperactive,</v>

1040
00:57:40.501 --> 00:57:42.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just means they're alive.</v>

1041
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:47.870
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be taken out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>school yard and supervised well playing </v>

1042
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:50.430
<v Speaker 1>until they're completely exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they should have a little nap.</v>

1043
00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe you could teach them </v>
<v Speaker 1>something for awhile,</v>

1044
00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:54.210
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1045
00:57:55.910 --> 00:58:00.910
<v Speaker 1>stopping them from playing on an or or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not facilitating play among them is </v>

1046
00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:06.580
<v Speaker 1>absolutely crazy because that's exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>how children come to become social in </v>

1047
00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:11.381
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that the </v>

1048
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:14.711
<v Speaker 1>games children play are analogs of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities that adults engage in.</v>

1049
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that hard to figure it out.</v>

1050
00:58:16.971 --> 00:58:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it,</v>

1051
00:58:18.531 --> 00:58:21.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about playing monopoly or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a teenager,</v>

1052
00:58:21.471 --> 00:58:24.200
<v Speaker 1>you play monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people have played monopoly?</v>

1053
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's played monopoly.</v>

1054
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

1055
00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.830
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like evil capitalist pig gain,</v>

1056
00:58:30.831 --> 00:58:32.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1057
00:58:32.051 --> 00:58:34.490
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to grow up to be an evil</v>

1058
00:58:34.491 --> 00:58:36.950
<v Speaker 1>capitalist pig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can get a good practice,</v>

1059
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:40.040
<v Speaker 1>good practice going by playing monopoly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>

1060
00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:43.970
<v Speaker 1>you can become part of the one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you have to do to win,</v>

1061
00:58:43.971 --> 00:58:48.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to have all the hotels and so </v>

1062
00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:51.560
<v Speaker 1>no one else has any hotels and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play that and it's fun.</v>

1063
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:56.630
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an analog of real life now.</v>

1064
00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:02.230
<v Speaker 1>It's an analog of real life in many ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the things that you do </v>

1065
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:05.900
<v Speaker 1>with other people involve adhering to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>set of shared rules.</v>

1066
00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And most of the things that you do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people involve cooperating and </v>

1067
00:59:12.141 --> 00:59:15.430
<v Speaker 1>competing with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're playing monopoly,</v>

1068
00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.030
<v Speaker 1>are you cooperating or competing?</v>

1069
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 1>How many people think competing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1070
00:59:22.341 --> 00:59:25.160
<v Speaker 1>How many people think cooperating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1071
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 1>you're cooperating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you playing the same rules?</v>

1072
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Are you playing by the same rules?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1073
00:59:33.201 --> 00:59:34.550
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're cheating.</v>

1074
00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:36.770
<v Speaker 1>If you're cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not playing monopoly,</v>

1075
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:37.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're cheating.</v>

1076
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:43.030
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's a different game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to play monopoly you have to </v>

1077
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:44.270
<v Speaker 1>cooperate because you have to all agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sit in the same place.</v>

1078
00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 1>You have to agree not to steal the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1079
00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:50.330
<v Speaker 1>You have to agree that the stupid rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are completely arbitrary,</v>

1080
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:52.790
<v Speaker 1>are the ones that are going to govern </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life for the next,</v>

1081
00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours.</v>

1082
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:58.490
<v Speaker 1>You have to agree to try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to agree to try to have fun.</v>

1083
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.670
<v Speaker 1>You have to agree to try to be like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good player,</v>

1084
01:00:01.671 --> 01:00:04.200
<v Speaker 1>which means you don't get all sniffly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whiny when someone,</v>

1085
01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.690
<v Speaker 1>when you land on someone's boardwalk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they completely bankrupt you,</v>

1086
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're cooperating like mad.</v>

1087
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.760
<v Speaker 1>And another thing piaget pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely lovely,</v>

1088
01:00:13.761 --> 01:00:18.761
<v Speaker 1>is that you can have a game without </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation and competition at the same </v>

1089
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:24.670
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no such thing as cooperative </v>

1090
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:26.630
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have for it to be a game,</v>

1091
01:00:26.631 --> 01:00:31.631
<v Speaker 1>it has to be competition within </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation or it can be cooperation </v>

1092
01:00:31.631 --> 01:00:33.200
<v Speaker 1>within competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within cooperation.</v>

1093
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are very complex and the </v>

1094
01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're playing hockey,</v>

1095
01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:39.050
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1096
01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.340
<v Speaker 1>is hockey and aggressive game or come or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cooperative game?</v>

1097
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to play by the rules.</v>

1098
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>So both teams agree to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on the ice at the same time.</v>

1099
01:00:49.131 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't bring a basket basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't bring a chess game.</v>

1100
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:56.710
<v Speaker 1>you're there to play hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you cooperating or competing with </v>

1101
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>your teammates?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1102
01:00:56.871 --> 01:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1103
01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>You're cooperating with them because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want everyone to win.</v>

1104
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want everybody to get better at </v>

1105
01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:07.631
<v Speaker 1>playing across time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're competing with them because </v>

1106
01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:08.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can be the star of the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's happy about that.</v>

1107
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:10.340
<v Speaker 1>And then with the other team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1108
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:12.290
<v Speaker 1>are you cooperating or competing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

1109
01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're playing by the rules,</v>

1110
01:01:14.631 --> 01:01:19.631
<v Speaker 1>you're cooperating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's obviously an element of </v>

1111
01:01:19.631 --> 01:01:19.631
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1112
01:01:19.631 --> 01:01:21.680
<v Speaker 1>almost every human activity has those </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>

1113
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a body of rules underneath it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're not rules,</v>

1114
01:01:24.711 --> 01:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>they're at least social conventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1115
01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>There are things that people understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>are allowed and not allowed,</v>

1116
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a competitive and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperative element.</v>

1117
01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what children's start to </v>

1118
01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:38.180
<v Speaker 1>become particularly exposed to when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're about three.</v>

1119
01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll piaget pointed out that there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense two classes of children's </v>

1120
01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:48.161
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was the games that have a really </v>

1121
01:01:48.161 --> 01:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>clearly defined aim and that'd be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal and that'd be like,</v>

1122
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:56.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the little circles that we were </v>

1123
01:01:56.291 --> 01:01:56.291
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you're trying to go.</v>

1124
01:01:56.291 --> 01:02:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about it being a game is that </v>

1125
01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:03.700
<v Speaker 1>all of you have to be trying to go there</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time and so what piaget </v>

1126
01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:08.620
<v Speaker 1>realized was that just as the child is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to integrate all their little </v>

1127
01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:11.420
<v Speaker 1>micro games inside them into some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of unified thing,</v>

1128
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>which would be the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stable personality across time and </v>

1129
01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.510
<v Speaker 1>capable of weathering the storms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1130
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:22.990
<v Speaker 1>When a group of children get together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they build another one of those </v>

1131
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:26.211
<v Speaker 1>routines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it includes all of them and so the </v>

1132
01:02:26.211 --> 01:02:26.211
<v Speaker 1>kids might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1133
01:02:26.211 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>let's play hide and go seek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one,</v>

1134
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>and everyone knows the rules to hide and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go seek and you can win or lose it </v>

1135
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>heightened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go seek.</v>

1136
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:38.301
<v Speaker 1>But what you're trying to do is you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring your subpersonalities all the </v>

1137
01:02:38.301 --> 01:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>way up to their integrated state </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath a metal structure,</v>

1138
01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>but that's organized by the collection </v>
<v Speaker 1>of children.</v>

1139
01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>So the child would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1140
01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>do you want to play hide and go seek?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're supposed to say you're either</v>

1141
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>supposed to say yes or perhaps positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>another game.</v>

1142
01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:59.840
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to freak out or get </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry or say that that's a stupid game </v>

1143
01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.171
<v Speaker 1>or run back to your mom because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be very popular and </v>

1144
01:03:03.171 --> 01:03:06.681
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't get to play well then </v>

1145
01:03:06.681 --> 01:03:06.681
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

1146
01:03:06.681 --> 01:03:09.990
<v Speaker 1>You're ruined because if you don't learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to play with others between two and </v>

1147
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:14.001
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never learn and then you're some </v>

1148
01:03:14.001 --> 01:03:16.131
<v Speaker 1>poor outcast and maybe you end up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail or at least you end up like </v>

1149
01:03:16.131 --> 01:03:20.090
<v Speaker 1>isolated and and awkward and and poorly </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially integrated.</v>

1150
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good because if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into the kids' games at three,</v>

1151
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:29.400
<v Speaker 1>all of them start moving ahead and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1152
01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:32.220
<v Speaker 1>And the farther they've moved ahead past</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1153
01:03:32.221 --> 01:03:34.290
<v Speaker 1>the less likely it is that they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play with you.</v>

1154
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.320
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that's really worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about if you're going to have </v>

1155
01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.071
<v Speaker 1>kids is you have a job as a parent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your job as a parent is to make your </v>

1156
01:03:43.071 --> 01:03:47.361
<v Speaker 1>child socially acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially to other children by the time</v>

1157
01:03:47.551 --> 01:03:50.640
<v Speaker 1>they're three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do that well,</v>

1158
01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:55.250
<v Speaker 1>that's not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll pay for it and so will your child</v>

1159
01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.080
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been lots of longterm followup.</v>

1160
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>So on this sort of thing and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty evident that if the kid isn't </v>

1161
01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>socialized by</v>

1162
01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.230
<v Speaker 2>for then good luck.</v>

1163
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>There is no evidence at all from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental literature,</v>

1164
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.290
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a dismal literature that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fix that.</v>

1165
01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.660
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1166
01:04:15.661 --> 01:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>so the children don't get together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

1167
01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:20.850
<v Speaker 1>well here's what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone says yes.</v>

1168
01:04:20.851 --> 01:04:25.650
<v Speaker 1>And so they orient their personalities </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards that goal and then they interact</v>

1169
01:04:25.651 --> 01:04:30.651
<v Speaker 1>in a cooperative and competitive way in </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing the goal and that's a game and </v>

1170
01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:35.871
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing is practicing being </v>
<v Speaker 1>social human beings and so and they do </v>

1171
01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>that with all sorts of different games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might say,</v>

1172
01:04:38.101 --> 01:04:40.860
<v Speaker 1>well here's something really worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about.</v>

1173
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:43.680
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to be a functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being?</v>

1174
01:04:46.070 --> 01:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>It to me it means to be the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being that can be a good player </v>

1175
01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:54.690
<v Speaker 1>across multiple games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>

1176
01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:57.240
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell your kid,</v>

1177
01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hockey game that I saw once hockey </v>

1178
01:05:05.691 --> 01:05:09.020
<v Speaker 1>parents say 10 percent of them should </v>
<v Speaker 1>just be jailed as soon as they enter the</v>

1179
01:05:09.021 --> 01:05:12.080
<v Speaker 1>arena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when my kid played,</v>

1180
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you'd call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a level</v>

1181
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>high level hockey for a while when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a kid anyways,</v>

1182
01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>he was a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a good hockey player,</v>

1183
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.720
<v Speaker 1>but it was really unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we didn't do it for very long for a </v>

1184
01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:27.720
<v Speaker 1>variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

1185
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.880
<v Speaker 1>on his way to learning how to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey,</v>

1186
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>he was in one of these uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local leagues.</v>

1187
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:40.380
<v Speaker 1>We had an arena just around the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunately enough and he wasn't the </v>

1188
01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.060
<v Speaker 1>best player on the team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

1189
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>another kid on the team who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is better,</v>

1190
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I would save.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1191
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in a championship game at one </v>

1192
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hadn't been in very many championship</v>

1193
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>games because there's teams often work </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>

1194
01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:00.360
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the local championship and we </v>

1195
01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.690
<v Speaker 1>went and watched and it was a really fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

1196
01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was really close,</v>

1197
01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I think if I think it was three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three till the final 15 or 20 seconds,</v>

1198
01:06:06.791 --> 01:06:10.120
<v Speaker 1>and then some kid from the other team </v>
<v Speaker 1>scored a really good goal,</v>

1199
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:10.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1200
01:06:10.571 --> 01:06:15.571
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't one of those things where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally kicked the pocket into the </v>

1201
01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:15.571
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] or something.</v>

1202
01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:16.660
<v Speaker 1>It was a really nice play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was a tight game.</v>

1203
01:06:16.661 --> 01:06:21.661
<v Speaker 1>The teams were well matched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the local league had made sure like </v>

1204
01:06:21.661 --> 01:06:24.400
<v Speaker 1>they'd set up teams together and then if</v>
<v Speaker 1>one team kept winning to consistently or</v>

1205
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:29.401
<v Speaker 1>one losing to consistently being sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>revamp the team so they were roughly </v>

1206
01:06:29.401 --> 01:06:30.070
<v Speaker 1>equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I really liked because,</v>

1207
01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the kids got a reasonably equal shot</v>

1208
01:06:32.591 --> 01:06:35.020
<v Speaker 1>at it and everybody got to develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

1209
01:06:35.021 --> 01:06:36.460
<v Speaker 1>we were watching that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty fun.</v>

1210
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.760
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1211
01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:43.790
<v Speaker 1>the star kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was skating around out there and the </v>

1212
01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:47.521
<v Speaker 1>game ended and he went off the ice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he smashed his hockey stick onto the </v>

1213
01:06:47.521 --> 01:06:48.360
<v Speaker 1>cement because he was all irritated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1214
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:53.370
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then his father came running up to </v>

1215
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:53.370
<v Speaker 1>him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1216
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:54.880
<v Speaker 1>you got robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really terrible,</v>

1217
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:58.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rafting was bad and you play it very</v>

1218
01:06:58.031 --> 01:07:00.190
<v Speaker 1>well and you should have won the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't say,</v>

1219
01:07:00.191 --> 01:07:05.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop being a little rat and smashing </v>

1220
01:07:05.191 --> 01:07:05.191
<v Speaker 1>your hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick onto the cement like your three,</v>

1221
01:07:05.191 --> 01:07:05.890
<v Speaker 1>which is what he should have said.</v>

1222
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:07.590
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he</v>

1223
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.190
<v Speaker 1>basically rewarded his child for </v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic,</v>

1224
01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.520
<v Speaker 1>a immature misbehavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was pretty pathetic.</v>

1225
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Was child abuse as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of up the second,</v>

1226
01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>

1227
01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:24.820
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to train your child to be a</v>

1228
01:07:24.821 --> 01:07:26.860
<v Speaker 1>narcissist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That course,</v>

1229
01:07:26.861 --> 01:07:28.960
<v Speaker 1>that's child abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's moronic.</v>

1230
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Of course it was due to his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>foolishness,</v>

1231
01:07:30.971 --> 01:07:33.070
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if that's criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1232
01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 1>But it was really pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1233
01:07:35.381 --> 01:07:37.270
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think about this now for a minute.</v>

1234
01:07:37.271 --> 01:07:39.370
<v Speaker 1>So you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what did that kid do wrong?</v>

1235
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1236
01:07:40.631 --> 01:07:42.690
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's okay.</v>

1237
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:44.890
<v Speaker 1>You should want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're playing a game.</v>

1238
01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:49.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're not any fun if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing a game and you're not trying to </v>

1239
01:07:49.891 --> 01:07:51.250
<v Speaker 1>win and there's nothing more miserable </v>
<v Speaker 1>than playing a game with someone.</v>

1240
01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:56.260
<v Speaker 1>At the end of they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you won because I wasn't really </v>

1241
01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:56.260
<v Speaker 1>trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1242
01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:56.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to play with them again</v>

1243
01:07:56.891 --> 01:08:01.891
<v Speaker 1>if they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of interesting because </v>

1244
01:08:01.891 --> 01:08:01.891
<v Speaker 1>it means they've done something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1245
01:08:01.891 --> 01:08:05.200
<v Speaker 1>when even a kid can figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might tell your kid,</v>

1246
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>be a good sport and it doesn't matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you win or not.</v>

1247
01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:15.791
<v Speaker 1>It matters how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what the hell kid doesn't know how </v>

1248
01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:15.791
<v Speaker 1>to what to make of that and you hardly </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>

1249
01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1250
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.650
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what this means,</v>

1251
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but you'll tell the child that and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might think,</v>

1252
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to be a good sport?</v>

1253
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:31.390
<v Speaker 1>And and that and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you played the game is more </v>

1254
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.390
<v Speaker 1>important than whether you win or lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1255
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>so think about it this way.</v>

1256
01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.140
<v Speaker 1>What's your goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1257
01:08:39.141 --> 01:08:44.141
<v Speaker 1>you might say to win the hockey game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that implies you're only going to </v>

1258
01:08:44.141 --> 01:08:47.260
<v Speaker 1>play one hockey game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to play 100 hockey games </v>

1259
01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:51.260
<v Speaker 1>and then forget about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you're going to play 100 hockey </v>

1260
01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.601
<v Speaker 1>games and 200 basketball games and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>chess games and you're going to have a </v>

1261
01:08:53.601 --> 01:08:58.311
<v Speaker 1>bunch of jobs and you're going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of friends and you can have a </v>

1262
01:08:58.311 --> 01:08:59.940
<v Speaker 1>bunch of relationships and all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a game like structure and let's say</v>

1263
01:08:59.941 --> 01:09:04.941
<v Speaker 1>that you're a real son of a bitch when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you play hockey and so no one ever </v>

1264
01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:04.941
<v Speaker 1>invites you to do any of those other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1265
01:09:04.941 --> 01:09:05.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1266
01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:08.100
<v Speaker 1>you win the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you lose the metagame.</v>

1267
01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.120
<v Speaker 1>The metagame is the game that's made up </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the games you're ever going to </v>

1268
01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.091
<v Speaker 1>play and what a parent means when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say it doesn't matter whether you win or</v>

1269
01:09:17.791 --> 01:09:20.460
<v Speaker 1>lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it matters how you play the game is that</v>

1270
01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:25.700
<v Speaker 1>the metagame is more important than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game and you should learn how to play </v>

1271
01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>games so that whether or not you win or </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose,</v>

1272
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>people really want to play with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they want to play with you,</v>

1273
01:09:31.561 --> 01:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're set.</v>

1274
01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>

1275
01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>here's a cool game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1276
01:09:35.791 --> 01:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you two are going to play this game.</v>

1277
01:09:37.831 --> 01:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1278
01:09:39.001 --> 01:09:42.630
<v Speaker 1>So here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you $20.</v>

1279
01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:47.430
<v Speaker 1>You have to give some of that to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get to offer once.</v>

1280
01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:49.740
<v Speaker 1>If he rejects it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither of you get anything.</v>

1281
01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much are you going to give him?</v>

1282
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:53.820
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you take that?</v>

1283
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1284
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.120
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1285
01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean like these better than not </v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

1286
01:10:01.850 --> 01:10:03.540
<v Speaker 1>clara maass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1287
01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1288
01:10:04.681 --> 01:10:09.681
<v Speaker 1>So here's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This experiment is being done all over </v>

1289
01:10:09.681 --> 01:10:11.721
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so basically what they find is that </v>

1290
01:10:11.721 --> 01:10:13.890
<v Speaker 1>people pretty much offer 50 slash 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's something cool.</v>

1291
01:10:13.891 --> 01:10:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you go play this game and use </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 bucks in your planet with really poor</v>

1292
01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:19.890
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>

1293
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:22.650
<v Speaker 1>you set the game up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

1294
01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.060
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offer him two bucks,</v>

1295
01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:27.090
<v Speaker 1>he's poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll take it.</v>

1296
01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.190
<v Speaker 1>So you offered to box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does he do?</v>

1297
01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:32.720
<v Speaker 1>He tells you to screw off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1298
01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:35.040
<v Speaker 1>And he's more likely to do that if he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor.</v>

1299
01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:37.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

1300
01:10:37.591 --> 01:10:39.390
<v Speaker 1>like a classical economists would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1301
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.820
<v Speaker 1>what you should've done was offered them</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dollar.</v>

1302
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:45.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get 19,</v>

1303
01:10:45.150 --> 01:10:50.150
<v Speaker 1>he gets a dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to take the damn dollar </v>

1304
01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:50.280
<v Speaker 1>because it's better than nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But thAt is more people are like,</v>

1305
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:53.340
<v Speaker 1>it's like you give them a dollar and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get 19,</v>

1306
01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.440
<v Speaker 1>they want to punch you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1307
01:10:55.441 --> 01:11:00.441
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to take that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because they don't want to </v>

1308
01:11:00.441 --> 01:11:00.441
<v Speaker 1>play the game that way.</v>

1309
01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.990
<v Speaker 1>They want to play the game so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair across multiple games.</v>

1310
01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're playing out in front of</v>

1311
01:11:08.171 --> 01:11:11.700
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of people like we were now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's say a whole,</v>

1312
01:11:11.701 --> 01:11:16.701
<v Speaker 1>all these people are going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>invite you to play the same game and so </v>

1313
01:11:16.701 --> 01:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're going to be able to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>$400 in the next hour or so.</v>

1314
01:11:18.721 --> 01:11:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1315
01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:24.441
<v Speaker 1>what should I do if I wanted everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>to invite me to play this game as much </v>

1316
01:11:24.441 --> 01:11:24.441
<v Speaker 1>as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then how much would you offer?</v>

1317
01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

1318
01:11:27.151 --> 01:11:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1319
01:11:28.381 --> 01:11:30.270
<v Speaker 1>So that means actually you lost the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gate,</v>

1320
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>the one game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1321
01:11:31.231 --> 01:11:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Because you only get 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five and he gets 15,</v>

1322
01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:35.820
<v Speaker 1>but like everyone's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1323
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:38.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to play it escape with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

1324
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:42.510
<v Speaker 1>that's what it means when you tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone to play the game properly.</v>

1325
01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:48.290
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act as if while you're playing a </v>

1326
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:50.251
<v Speaker 1>specific game that there's a higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>order moral principle that has to do </v>

1327
01:11:50.251 --> 01:11:53.421
<v Speaker 1>with the total number of games that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to play across your entire </v>

1328
01:11:53.421 --> 01:11:54.900
<v Speaker 1>life and play that game properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1329
01:11:54.901 --> 01:11:59.901
<v Speaker 1>well that's the evolution of higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral thinking in part from a piagetian </v>

1330
01:11:59.901 --> 01:12:00.720
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bloody brilliant.</v>

1331
01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.680
<v Speaker 1>So right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see you tuesday.</v>
