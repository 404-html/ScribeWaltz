1
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.490
<v Speaker 1>So last time we talked a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the state of the world of belief,</v>

2
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I suppose by the end of the 19th century</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I talked to you a little bit about </v>

3
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>character guard.</v>

4
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very large number of the clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories that we're going to be </v>

5
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:33.921
<v Speaker 1>discussing for another two lectures </v>
<v Speaker 1>after this one have been influenced by </v>

6
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.350
<v Speaker 1>philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why I'm also talking </v>

7
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.081
<v Speaker 1>to you about the philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if in some sense the </v>

8
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:48.021
<v Speaker 1>great philosophers have our tap directly</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the lower strata of our,</v>

9
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.790
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our cultural systems of meaning as they </v>

10
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.441
<v Speaker 1>move forward in time and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>outline what those structures are and </v>

11
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:05.661
<v Speaker 1>also describe their weaknesses and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>strengths and their likely </v>

12
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>transformation moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously people can be behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the times and just as it's just as </v>

14
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>probable that some people are ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the times and we would assume,</v>

15
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking about it to say from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a big five traits perspective,</v>

16
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>that the people who are ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>times often are very,</v>

17
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent and very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very open.</v>

18
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of a philosopher,</v>

19
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 1>so Nietzsche and Dostoevsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think more than any other two thinkers</v>

20
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>had their finger on the pulse of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmutation of cultural systems,</v>

21
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>of meaning in the at the end of the 19th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

22
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>and they were both very concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the systems of meaning </v>

23
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>within which Western civilization at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least had taken shape,</v>

24
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>had been fragmented for a variety of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

25
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>The most important of which was likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise of the scientific world view.</v>

26
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>And as I detailed to you in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture,</v>

27
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>both Dostoevsky and Nisha believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had left modern people.</v>

28
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Because I think in the early 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century it was Western people,</v>

29
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:34.761
<v Speaker 1>but now I think it's reasonable to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's modern people in a state of </v>

30
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their,</v>

31
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>their cultural discontinuity things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief systems,</v>

32
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:49.221
<v Speaker 1>but also technological systems now have </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed the world so radically that </v>

33
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.160
<v Speaker 1>the conflict between modernism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional forms of belief is acutely </v>

34
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>felt everywhere.</v>

35
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the forces that have </v>

36
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.341
<v Speaker 1>given rise to the battle between Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism and modernism because </v>

37
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:16.231
<v Speaker 1>it's more of that than a battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic fundamentalism against the </v>

38
00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:19.591
<v Speaker 1>Western world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the problem fundamentally is that </v>

39
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>people typically exist within cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructs that are very,</v>

40
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:28.501
<v Speaker 1>very ancient and that have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are grounded in in evolved systems </v>

41
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:35.371
<v Speaker 1>of meaning that it are even deeper than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are articulated and </v>

42
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>explicit and when there's a period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

43
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:44.101
<v Speaker 1>very rapid cognitive and technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>change than the integrity of those </v>

44
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:49.381
<v Speaker 1>systems starts to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts to become questionable from an</v>

45
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.030
<v Speaker 1>explicit perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also starts to become </v>

46
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>insufficient from a practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

47
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:02.671
<v Speaker 1>So one example that you might give some </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration to is the fact of the </v>

48
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 1>introduction of the birth control pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

49
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>if you listen to politically minded </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

50
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>they make the case that the emancipation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of women was essentially a political </v>

51
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:24.091
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that that's a very </v>

52
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:24.091
<v Speaker 1>reasonable way of looking at it at all.</v>

53
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things,</v>

54
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.460
<v Speaker 1>everything feeds back onto itself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are multiple causal pathways to </v>

55
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:35.521
<v Speaker 1>any and the radical element in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emancipation of women was of course the </v>

56
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>development of efficient forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>contraception,</v>

57
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>most particularly the birth control </v>
<v Speaker 1>pill,</v>

58
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's the case that as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>educate women anywhere in the world,</v>

59
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>not only does economic productivity rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically,</v>

60
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:57.031
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually the best predictor of </v>

61
00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.981
<v Speaker 1>increase in economic predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity in a modernizing state is </v>

62
00:04:58.981 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the granting of rights to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

63
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:04.981
<v Speaker 1>whether it's directly because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>granting of rights to women or because </v>

64
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:10.531
<v Speaker 1>of the existence of an underlying belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that allows the concept of </v>

65
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:14.450
<v Speaker 1>right to expand quite rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to be sure of,</v>

66
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.470
<v Speaker 1>but in any case that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course the other thing that </v>

67
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.371
<v Speaker 1>happens is that women stop having </v>
<v Speaker 1>children unbelievably rapidly.</v>

68
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

69
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's Iran where this has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>most market over the last two </v>

70
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:37.411
<v Speaker 1>generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so from family size is far greater than </v>

71
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:40.861
<v Speaker 1>replacement two family sizes well below </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement in basically one or two </v>

72
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:45.481
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive transformation and it's </v>

73
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:45.481
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily something that anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected.</v>

74
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.490
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the sequence of forces that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are rapidly allowing our population to </v>

75
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>reach a peak and then either stabilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>or decline.</v>

76
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the projections are that there'll be</v>

77
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.140
<v Speaker 1>9 billion people on the earth within 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 50 years and that'll be our peak </v>

78
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>population after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will fall rapidly and you know,</v>

79
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>you can see that sort of thing happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now all over the western world and</v>

80
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.500
<v Speaker 1>it's happening a lot in China and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in Japan where there are more </v>

81
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>older people than there are younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because the younger people aren't</v>

82
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>having enough children to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>replace the population.</v>

83
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>So the probability that will peak at </v>
<v Speaker 1>about $9 million and then start to fall.</v>

84
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what the best projections </v>

85
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.890
<v Speaker 1>seemed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indicate now.</v>

86
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens anyways with in periods </v>

87
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.890
<v Speaker 1>of very rapid technological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive transformation,</v>

88
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:44.891
<v Speaker 1>because those things go together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the certainties upon which people </v>

89
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:49.330
<v Speaker 1>base their interpretation of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even more importantly base their </v>

90
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.300
<v Speaker 1>judgments about how to act start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become uncertain.</v>

91
00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.210
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you introduce the birth control pill </v>

92
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.481
<v Speaker 1>into a population and you put women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive faculties under their own </v>

93
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>voluntary choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you radically transformed virtually</v>

94
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>all of society's fundamental social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>

95
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>not least marriage and marriage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

96
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:20.831
<v Speaker 1>is being regarded plastically as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation of civilization and of course</v>

97
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>increasingly there are more people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't married.</v>

98
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Then there are people who are married </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

99
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.680
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to know what to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that because of course there's no </v>

100
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.221
<v Speaker 1>setting the clock back and it's not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear that you would want to set back </v>

101
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>the clock if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but expecting cultural constructs,</v>

102
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.860
<v Speaker 1>which takes centuries or maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands or maybe even tens of </v>

103
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years to develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep up with change of that magnitude</v>

104
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

105
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

106
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys face technological </v>

107
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>transformations that are earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>shattering on an almost yearly basis and</v>

108
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:06.550
<v Speaker 1>you hardly even notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

109
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>tinder is a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

110
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:13.901
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tinder is produced quite a spike in </v>

111
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:14.110
<v Speaker 1>sexually transmitted diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

112
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:19.180
<v Speaker 1>it's a radical technology because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first technology that's ever been </v>

113
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.751
<v Speaker 1>invented that enables men to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners with no fear,</v>

114
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:28.570
<v Speaker 1>with virtually no fear of rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's been a limiting </v>

115
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.471
<v Speaker 1>factor for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been a defining feature of the </v>

116
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>interactions between men and women ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>since history began.</v>

117
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.580
<v Speaker 1>And so these things are occurring at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at an extraordinary rate and of course </v>

118
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not reasonable to expect are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>slower moving cultural constructs to </v>

119
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:52.451
<v Speaker 1>keep up with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because as well that </v>

120
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:52.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk for example,</v>

121
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 1>about the divisive nature of religion.</v>

122
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 1>You often hear people who are critics of</v>
<v Speaker 1>formal religion in particular talk about</v>

123
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:03.771
<v Speaker 1>the fact that religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>underwire underlies a tremendous amount </v>

124
00:09:03.771 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>of destruction and warfare and conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

125
00:09:05.221 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't religion that does that.</v>

126
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:12.771
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tribalism and tribalism </v>

127
00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:15.040
<v Speaker 1>characterizes even chimpanzees and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think chimpanzees go to war with </v>

128
00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.690
<v Speaker 1>each other for religious reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

129
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.700
<v Speaker 1>the religious groupings of mankind are </v>
<v Speaker 1>our large scale manifestations of the </v>

130
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:27.831
<v Speaker 1>same phenomena that produce dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies in the wild and of course </v>

131
00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 1>large scale religions unite people </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the religion just as much as they</v>

132
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>divide people on the outside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the accumulation of religious</v>

133
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 1>tradition across time is a process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows thousands and 10,</v>

134
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:46.101
<v Speaker 1>thousands and even millions of people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist within the same hierarchy of </v>

135
00:09:46.101 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 1>values and exist relatively peacefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence.</v>

136
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm saying relatively peacefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

137
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years ago it was thought that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pre,</v>

138
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say archaic people.</v>

139
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:05.031
<v Speaker 1>So those would be people who are still </v>
<v Speaker 1>living a fairly isolated tribal life in </v>

140
00:10:05.031 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>small groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pre,</v>

141
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically operating at the level of </v>

142
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.501
<v Speaker 1>stone age technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the idea was there was a very </v>

143
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:14.250
<v Speaker 1>popular idea for a long time that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures were,</v>

144
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communistic and violence free.</v>

145
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not violence for you at all.</v>

146
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:23.250
<v Speaker 1>If you track the homicide rates in stone</v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

147
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:28.251
<v Speaker 1>culture is there way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way higher than they are in civilized </v>

148
00:10:28.251 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 1>cultures like orders of magnitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>

149
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>And there's a variety of reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

150
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:36.351
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just telling you that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to dispense with the idea that </v>

151
00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:41.060
<v Speaker 1>along with complex civilizations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this friend say of unifying religious </v>

152
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.140
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an increase,</v>

153
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:47.290
<v Speaker 1>an increase in baseline violence because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no evidence for that at </v>

154
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:47.290
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

155
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with these large scale </v>

156
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.260
<v Speaker 1>belief systems is they're not very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that is that </v>

157
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.370
<v Speaker 1>in order for a large scale belief system</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>

158
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.790
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

159
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest itself in any reasonable forum,</v>

160
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:07.491
<v Speaker 1>it has to be predicated on the mutual </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement of the people within whom </v>

161
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who operate within its embrace.</v>

162
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.700
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for,</v>

163
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.810
<v Speaker 1>for Toronto to exist as a city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a peaceful city,</v>

164
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:23.811
<v Speaker 1>basically what has to happen is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vast majority of us have to agree that </v>

165
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:29.151
<v Speaker 1>the rules that govern the city and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social interactions within the city are </v>

166
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.290
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just.</v>

167
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 1>And because if you don't agree with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

168
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:39.441
<v Speaker 1>then splinter movements of all starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to occur and people become more </v>

169
00:11:39.441 --> 00:11:44.031
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary in their modes of action </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they become more violent and </v>

170
00:11:44.031 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>the whole system starts to break down.</v>

171
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:49.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's not easy to establish a </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective norm because people have to </v>

172
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:55.851
<v Speaker 1>agree to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine that hammering out </v>

173
00:11:55.851 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>agreement with anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with even a small agreement that affects</v>

174
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:02.941
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people is a process that takes a </v>

175
00:12:02.941 --> 00:12:05.461
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can argue forever about the </v>

176
00:12:05.461 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 1>smallest alterations in the systems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate our behavior.</v>

177
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.240
<v Speaker 1>some of you might be familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terror management theories.</v>

179
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have heard of terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>management theory?</v>

180
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

181
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.440
<v Speaker 1>the terror management theories that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that our belief </v>

182
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.440
<v Speaker 1>systems protect us from our fear of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

183
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Now exactly how they do that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>specified particularly well in the </v>

184
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 1>terror management theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the originator of the theory,</v>

185
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:35.551
<v Speaker 1>whose name was Ernest Becker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a sociologist by the way and </v>

186
00:12:35.551 --> 00:12:35.551
<v Speaker 1>afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian,</v>

187
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:40.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that cultural systems enabled </v>

188
00:12:41.111 --> 00:12:46.111
<v Speaker 1>us to attribute beliefs to our actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finite and infinite,</v>

189
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 1>so that we could consider ourselves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to mortality.</v>

190
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hide from the truth of the attitude of </v>

191
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.870
<v Speaker 1>our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

192
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that terror management</v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists don't really give any credence</v>

193
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:04.741
<v Speaker 1>to is the fact that belief systems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only systems of belief systems of </v>

194
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 1>action regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

195
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:11.260
<v Speaker 1>So we've talked about the pig Eddie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of a game.</v>

196
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:17.070
<v Speaker 1>The game exists first as something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone can play and only later as </v>

197
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 1>something that people represent and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>social cultures the same way,</v>

198
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.640
<v Speaker 1>a cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a culture regulates the way that you </v>

199
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.671
<v Speaker 1>interact with each other and what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect from each other and how you can </v>

200
00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:33.691
<v Speaker 1>fulfill your mutual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your needs in relationship to one </v>

201
00:13:33.691 --> 00:13:36.931
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's represented and the </v>

202
00:13:36.931 --> 00:13:38.440
<v Speaker 1>representation might help you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning in your life.</v>

203
00:13:38.441 --> 00:13:41.320
<v Speaker 1>But the fact of the initial social </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>

204
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.710
<v Speaker 1>which is the phenomena that regulates </v>
<v Speaker 1>your interpersonal behavior,</v>

205
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.120
<v Speaker 1>doesn't protect you from the fear of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death that protects you from dying.</v>

206
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very important thing to </v>

207
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:54.830
<v Speaker 1>note.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

208
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:54.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of you know,</v>

209
00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.180
<v Speaker 1>of course it's very cold out today and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet here you are in this classroom where</v>

210
00:13:58.181 --> 00:14:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it's Renault ridiculously comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:06.810
<v Speaker 1>by classroom standards and of course by </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards around the world and you're </v>

212
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Speaker 1>not freezing to death in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not your belief.</v>

213
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.930
<v Speaker 1>It's protecting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that you're embedded in </v>

214
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.110
<v Speaker 1>this insanely complicated system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural interactions.</v>

215
00:14:17.111 --> 00:14:20.530
<v Speaker 1>And it just so happens that you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit here and listen to a lecture.</v>

216
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's thousands of people being </v>

217
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:25.800
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them outside in the cold,</v>

218
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 1>making sure that the power grid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

219
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that keeps this place warm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is property maintained and functional,</v>

220
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:34.910
<v Speaker 1>which takes a tremendous amount of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when in,</v>

221
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 1>during periods of rapid transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for the social contract to </v>

222
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.311
<v Speaker 1>adjust itself so that everyone knows how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to behave in relationship to one </v>

223
00:14:44.311 --> 00:14:44.311
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

224
00:14:44.311 --> 00:14:46.450
<v Speaker 1>But then it's also very difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the description of that.</v>

225
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:49.930
<v Speaker 1>So the articulated norms that constitute</v>
<v Speaker 1>a society,</v>

226
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:55.170
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transform rapidly enough so that they </v>

227
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:59.081
<v Speaker 1>can keep track of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the changes and and help people </v>

228
00:14:59.081 --> 00:15:03.041
<v Speaker 1>decide what they should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example.</v>

229
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:08.291
<v Speaker 1>So I had a client Hawaiian back who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been raised as the fundamentalist </v>

230
00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:13.181
<v Speaker 1>Christian and she was very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had been socialized and had come to </v>

231
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:18.740
<v Speaker 1>believe that sex before marriage was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

232
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:23.741
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that she was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get married before she was 27 or 28 </v>

233
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 1>was low for a whole variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then she faced this conundrum and</v>

234
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 1>it was an interesting conundrum from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective because you know,</v>

235
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I think that in a well regulated psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality is integrated into the </v>

236
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 1>personality so that it's so that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays its role in the,</v>

237
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.720
<v Speaker 1>what would you call in the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the self.</v>

238
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.330
<v Speaker 1>It's integrated properly inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's under moral control,</v>

239
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.200
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking because it serves its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own function,</v>

240
00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:59.201
<v Speaker 1>plus the function of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of keeping the person well situated in </v>

241
00:15:59.201 --> 00:16:03.581
<v Speaker 1>the present and developing property in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future and maintaining proper </v>

242
00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:07.481
<v Speaker 1>relationships with everyone around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was quite obvious to me that a </v>

243
00:16:07.481 --> 00:16:12.011
<v Speaker 1>lot of the constraints that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>placed on her behavior as a consequence </v>

244
00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:15.821
<v Speaker 1>of her relatively rigid belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're actually interfering with her </v>

245
00:16:15.821 --> 00:16:15.980
<v Speaker 1>development as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

246
00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:18.080
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things we had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>puzzle out was,</v>

247
00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:23.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what are the moral guidelines </v>

248
00:16:23.081 --> 00:16:26.390
<v Speaker 1>that you should use to regulate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual behavior outside of marriage?</v>

249
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:28.460
<v Speaker 1>If you're not planning to be married </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

250
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe until your late twenties.</v>

251
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

252
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.340
<v Speaker 1>good luck trying to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a really.</v>

253
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

254
00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:37.610
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really complicated question.</v>

255
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:42.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly not obvious that any </v>
<v Speaker 1>one person can figure out the answer to </v>

256
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Speaker 1>that in a single lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

257
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.150
<v Speaker 1>even if they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if nothing else,</v>

258
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.480
<v Speaker 1>especially because the landscape itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>is transforming as you're attempting to </v>

259
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.120
<v Speaker 1>adjust to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

260
00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:58.121
<v Speaker 1>when we eventually concluded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it was a very individual </v>

261
00:16:58.121 --> 00:17:02.471
<v Speaker 1>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we eventually concluded that there were </v>

262
00:17:02.471 --> 00:17:02.471
<v Speaker 1>things that she had forbidden herself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

263
00:17:02.471 --> 00:17:07.271
<v Speaker 1>that we're stopping her from </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing any kind of longterm </v>

264
00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:09.290
<v Speaker 1>relationship at all and that that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>interfering with her development,</v>

265
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a mature person and that the morality</v>

266
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:17.801
<v Speaker 1>that she had used to structured her </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior appeared to be </v>

267
00:17:17.801 --> 00:17:17.801
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least,</v>

268
00:17:17.801 --> 00:17:18.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some,</v>

269
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.710
<v Speaker 1>in some areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's one thing to,</v>

270
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:22.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

271
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.780
<v Speaker 1>to regulate sexuality in the hopes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage when you get married when </v>

272
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.591
<v Speaker 1>you're 19 or 20 or 21,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a completely different thing when </v>

273
00:17:32.591 --> 00:17:33.860
<v Speaker 1>it's perhaps not going to happen until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in your late twenties.</v>

274
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.700
<v Speaker 1>So now need shit talked a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky talked a lot about the </v>

275
00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:45.020
<v Speaker 1>collapse of meaning systems in the late </v>
<v Speaker 1>19th century.</v>

276
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was followed by a very,</v>

277
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:52.750
<v Speaker 1>very rapid period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technological transformation like that </v>

278
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 1>really kicked in in the late 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>

279
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:53.850
<v Speaker 1>which was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well was it the height of the industrial</v>

281
00:17:57.331 --> 00:17:59.070
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in England.</v>

282
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:04.071
<v Speaker 1>And there were modern technologies being</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrust out of the industrial revolution,</v>

283
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:06.750
<v Speaker 1>like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the automobile in the airplane,</v>

284
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:11.220
<v Speaker 1>in the electric light and recording </v>
<v Speaker 1>devices and all of the things that we're</v>

285
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 1>still elaborating on now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

286
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:22.070
<v Speaker 1>apart from the collapse of classic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say Christian belief and the </v>

287
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.940
<v Speaker 1>introduction of all these new </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies.</v>

288
00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:28.941
<v Speaker 1>When World War One hit the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>monarchical structure of the Western </v>

289
00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:33.111
<v Speaker 1>world collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that also occurred say with regards </v>

290
00:18:33.111 --> 00:18:35.841
<v Speaker 1>to the Ottoman Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was partly what led to the </v>

291
00:18:35.841 --> 00:18:37.230
<v Speaker 1>creation of the modern Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course we're still,</v>

292
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 1>that still hasn't been sorted out to any</v>
<v Speaker 1>great degree at all.</v>

293
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.150
<v Speaker 1>So the monarchical structures collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ancient civilizations,</v>

294
00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Russians underwent their revolution and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

295
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and were transformed into communists.</v>

296
00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:56.121
<v Speaker 1>And then after World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress between the potential </v>

297
00:18:57.781 --> 00:19:02.781
<v Speaker 1>different ways of structuring societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the monarchical societies had </v>

298
00:19:02.781 --> 00:19:04.560
<v Speaker 1>collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was almost unbearable.</v>

299
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 1>And people didn't really know what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

300
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

301
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

302
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.510
<v Speaker 1>What happened at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of niches,</v>

303
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:16.530
<v Speaker 1>period and Dostoyevsky's period?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that the question that both of those</v>

304
00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

305
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.730
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No</v>

306
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:26.170
<v Speaker 1>most important question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of those people asked became the </v>

307
00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.341
<v Speaker 1>central focus of the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical ideas of ethics in the </v>

308
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:30.850
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could think about those.</v>

309
00:19:30.851 --> 00:19:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Is that as a kind of a post religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethic?</v>

310
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Now the reason I'm telling you this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because among other things is because a </v>

311
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.801
<v Speaker 1>lot of what cycle analytic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic treatment is about is </v>

312
00:19:45.041 --> 00:19:49.840
<v Speaker 1>about ethics and that can't be stressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much because ethics is about how you</v>

313
00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:54.841
<v Speaker 1>see the world and how you behave and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>even behaviorists who are technically </v>

314
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.210
<v Speaker 1>embedded in the scientific world are </v>
<v Speaker 1>still pregnant,</v>

315
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:04.320
<v Speaker 1>practical emphasis because what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently doing with their clients is</v>

316
00:20:04.481 --> 00:20:08.290
<v Speaker 1>breaking down whatever the problems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are causing the misery,</v>

317
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.770
<v Speaker 1>breaking them down into sub problems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out solutions that </v>

318
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.620
<v Speaker 1>improve their quality of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like practical,</v>

319
00:20:14.621 --> 00:20:17.740
<v Speaker 1>implementable solutions that improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>their quality of life.</v>

320
00:20:17.741 --> 00:20:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Not only now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as they propagate into the future.</v>

321
00:20:20.771 --> 00:20:24.490
<v Speaker 1>And that is not a scientific issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a how to live issue.</v>

322
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.390
<v Speaker 1>So the entire history of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

323
00:20:28.391 --> 00:20:29.650
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

324
00:20:29.651 --> 00:20:34.651
<v Speaker 1>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and psychological was a sequence of </v>

325
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.900
<v Speaker 1>attempts to answer the question when </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fundamental systems of ethics </v>

326
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.610
<v Speaker 1>collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it that you should live</v>

327
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.540
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said very clearly that there would</v>

328
00:20:46.541 --> 00:20:50.440
<v Speaker 1>be two to the collapse of these systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one would be nihilism.</v>

329
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.920
<v Speaker 1>The belief that nothing at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he also regarded as a form of </v>

330
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.911
<v Speaker 1>escape from responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a logical consequence of the </v>

331
00:20:59.911 --> 00:21:03.841
<v Speaker 1>breakdown of classical belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a a cop out and it's the </v>

332
00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 1>kind of cop out the Dostoevsky explored </v>
<v Speaker 1>very deeply in his small,</v>

333
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 1>brilliant novel notes from underground </v>
<v Speaker 1>which describes a person who's basically</v>

334
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:18.270
<v Speaker 1>slipped an intelligent person and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible person who's basically </v>

335
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:22.501
<v Speaker 1>slipped into a pit of meaninglessness </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he experienced his hatred and </v>

336
00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:27.511
<v Speaker 1>resentment and the desire for revenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of the sorts of things that </v>

337
00:21:27.511 --> 00:21:31.291
<v Speaker 1>would afflict someone in the underworld </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's got nothing to hold them together.</v>

338
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:36.910
<v Speaker 1>And then of course you also talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the likelihood that people would turn to</v>

339
00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:38.950
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian belief systems such as.</v>

340
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.960
<v Speaker 1>And he particularly discussed communism </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a replacement for religious belief.</v>

341
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a Canadian example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

342
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:51.781
<v Speaker 1>So I heard a Gallup pollster one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a conference in Ottawa.</v>

343
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.810
<v Speaker 1>So the only time I've ever heard this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's an amazing.</v>

344
00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:01.410
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were looking at the probability </v>

345
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:05.521
<v Speaker 1>that people would be separatist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec and if you are a lapsed Catholic,</v>

346
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:10.540
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you will be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate as was increased 10 times.</v>

347
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

348
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism fell apart in Quebec in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late 19 fifties.</v>

349
00:22:16.421 --> 00:22:20.260
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the last places in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western world,</v>

350
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:22.510
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>

351
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.680
<v Speaker 1>the feudal in some sense structures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism had maintained themselves </v>

352
00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:31.210
<v Speaker 1>right up to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right up until the 19 fifties,</v>

353
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.850
<v Speaker 1>late 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that collapsed precipitously low,</v>

354
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 1>just like belief in Christianity had in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

355
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:38.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the late,</v>

356
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.180
<v Speaker 1>say 18 eighties.</v>

357
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And what happened in Quebec was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

358
00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:44.590
<v Speaker 1>the birth rate plummeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

359
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I did genetic research in Quebec and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 fifties and before that it was </v>

360
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.600
<v Speaker 1>very typical to see families of nine to </v>
<v Speaker 1>13 children.</v>

361
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.810
<v Speaker 1>And of course now rebecca has the lowest</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth rate.</v>

362
00:22:55.811 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the Western world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way below replacement.</v>

363
00:22:58.391 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Everybody bailed out of the church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gets married.</v>

364
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.390
<v Speaker 1>And if you were a separate as if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were a lapsed Catholic,</v>

365
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:06.640
<v Speaker 1>you are 10 times more likely to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>separatist.</v>

366
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.970
<v Speaker 1>All that meant was that with Catholicism</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell apart,</v>

367
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who still needed to have very </v>

368
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 1>structured belief systems just turned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism as a natural alternative,</v>

369
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of what,</v>

370
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that's part of what accounted for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rigidity and utopian,</v>

371
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the utopia and utopia nature of the </v>

372
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Quebec movement towards independence.</v>

373
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember talking to one of my </v>

374
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:37.480
<v Speaker 1>colleagues are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intelligent person and uh,</v>

375
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked him because at that point they </v>

376
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.240
<v Speaker 1>were predicting that if Quebec </v>
<v Speaker 1>separated,</v>

377
00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 1>the Canadian dollar would fall to forty </v>
<v Speaker 1>cents,</v>

378
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:50.771
<v Speaker 1>forty five cents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>US something like that and be complete </v>

379
00:23:50.771 --> 00:23:50.771
<v Speaker 1>economic catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

380
00:23:50.771 --> 00:23:50.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

381
00:23:50.771 --> 00:23:55.631
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the predictions are that if Canada </v>

382
00:23:55.631 --> 00:23:58.001
<v Speaker 1>separates and first of all or Quebec </v>
<v Speaker 1>separates and no one would know how to </v>

383
00:23:58.001 --> 00:23:59.120
<v Speaker 1>do that as the Canadian economy will </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse,</v>

384
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:01.670
<v Speaker 1>and of course that'll collapse the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Quebec economy too.</v>

385
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.190
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't deny that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

386
00:24:04.191 --> 00:24:05.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be worth it.</v>

387
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:07.100
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

388
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:12.101
<v Speaker 1>there's just no way of having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and under those </v>

389
00:24:12.101 --> 00:24:12.101
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because from my perspective,</v>

390
00:24:12.101 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 1>total,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

391
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.850
<v Speaker 1>severe economic collapse is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason not to do something,</v>

392
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:22.180
<v Speaker 1>but if you believe that the pope of </v>
<v Speaker 1>future potential is such that that's </v>

393
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.230
<v Speaker 1>justified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then well,</v>

394
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.340
<v Speaker 1>there's no arguing with you.</v>

395
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.280
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that you decided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the end of that.</v>

396
00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 1>And when I lived in Quebec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I did for a long time,</v>

397
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:35.981
<v Speaker 1>I learned very quickly never have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about politics with anyone </v>

398
00:24:35.981 --> 00:24:38.300
<v Speaker 1>who was a separatist because it was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely counterproductive.</v>

399
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had axioms of belief that were </v>

400
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.020
<v Speaker 1>movable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future will be good enough so that </v>

401
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:47.020
<v Speaker 1>no matter what price we pay in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

402
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.440
<v Speaker 1>that will be justified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

403
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not an idea,</v>

404
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:54.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a statement of faith and you saw </v>

405
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:56.420
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not with the same principles.</v>

406
00:24:56.421 --> 00:25:01.421
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you saw the same thing happening </v>

407
00:25:01.421 --> 00:25:02.600
<v Speaker 1>from a psychological perspective in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia when the Communists,</v>

408
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:07.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the communists really started to </v>

409
00:25:07.601 --> 00:25:09.101
<v Speaker 1>become active in the 19 twenties when </v>
<v Speaker 1>any matter of horror whatsoever was </v>

410
00:25:09.101 --> 00:25:13.721
<v Speaker 1>fully justifiable because it was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring about some future state that </v>

411
00:25:13.721 --> 00:25:15.170
<v Speaker 1>was basically equivalent to paradise.</v>

412
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and then you know,</v>

413
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:24.221
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky pursued the idea of nihilism </v>
<v Speaker 1>even farther because Dostoevsky was </v>

414
00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:29.591
<v Speaker 1>certainly someone who is willing to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ends of an argument and one of </v>

415
00:25:29.591 --> 00:25:33.221
<v Speaker 1>the things he proclaimed was that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no god than anything was </v>

416
00:25:33.221 --> 00:25:37.481
<v Speaker 1>permitted and his basic hypothesis was </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as if there is no all ultimate </v>

417
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.520
<v Speaker 1>arbiter of values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's no transcendent arbiter of </v>

418
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.990
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're radically free.</v>

419
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Now the existentialists would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

420
00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:50.420
<v Speaker 1>you could use that radical freedom to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find meaning in your life,</v>

421
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things Dostoevsky </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized was that you could use that </v>

422
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.480
<v Speaker 1>radical freedom for anything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>

423
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.640
<v Speaker 1>And so in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime and punishment,</v>

424
00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he explores the actions and beliefs of a</v>

425
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:08.111
<v Speaker 1>student named rascal in the cog and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescheduled the call is a starving </v>

426
00:26:08.111 --> 00:26:12.521
<v Speaker 1>student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a law student and he doesn't have </v>

427
00:26:12.521 --> 00:26:12.521
<v Speaker 1>enough to eat.</v>

428
00:26:12.521 --> 00:26:15.580
<v Speaker 1>So of course he's his cognition is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit on the adult side because </v>

429
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.450
<v Speaker 1>he's going through periods of starvation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drunkenness,</v>

430
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:21.080
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like he's thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly he wants to become a law student</v>

431
00:26:21.081 --> 00:26:25.790
<v Speaker 1>so that it can help society and he finds</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that his sister is basically willing</v>

432
00:26:25.791 --> 00:26:30.791
<v Speaker 1>to enter into a loveless marriage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less prostituted herself so that</v>

433
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:36.101
<v Speaker 1>she can generate enough money to share </v>
<v Speaker 1>with her mother so that they can fund </v>

434
00:26:36.101 --> 00:26:40.661
<v Speaker 1>his continuation through law school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks that wouldn't be a very good </v>

435
00:26:40.661 --> 00:26:41.780
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

436
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.990
<v Speaker 1>he's indebted a pawn broker who everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>hates,</v>

437
00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:49.650
<v Speaker 1>who is an absolutely miserable person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>every possible way.</v>

438
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky sets up the situation like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

439
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:55.440
<v Speaker 1>So the pawn broker has a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

440
00:26:55.441 --> 00:26:57.520
<v Speaker 1>who she basically enslaved and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistreated,</v>

441
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.910
<v Speaker 1>and she squirrels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrels away,</v>

442
00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:02.130
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never does anything with it,</v>

443
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:07.131
<v Speaker 1>lives in absolute poverty and anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he considers her the sort of person </v>

444
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 1>without whom the world would be a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

445
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.130
<v Speaker 1>So having all of these things co </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring in his imagination,</v>

446
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.160
<v Speaker 1>he decides that because there are no </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate arbiter of value,</v>

447
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:21.810
<v Speaker 1>that all morality is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice,</v>

448
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.700
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of the reverse of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature concluded.</v>

449
00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said most people were cowardly and </v>

450
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.301
<v Speaker 1>justified that with their morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but responding to calls took the other </v>

451
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:33.301
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

452
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:35.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do I have to obey any rules at all?</v>

453
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 1>If there's no ultimate source for any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these rules?</v>

454
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just convention and cowardice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

455
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.730
<v Speaker 1>and if I have enough strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can leave outside of that </v>

456
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.380
<v Speaker 1>framework and I can do whatever I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he decides to kill the,</v>

457
00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.140
<v Speaker 1>the pawnbroker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he does and quite successfully.</v>

458
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:57.141
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets away with it and that's about </v>

459
00:27:57.141 --> 00:28:00.141
<v Speaker 1>the first third of crime and punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rest of the book is the </v>

460
00:28:00.141 --> 00:28:04.050
<v Speaker 1>discussion of the manner in which he </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes unglued as a consequence of having</v>

461
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:05.190
<v Speaker 1>performed this act.</v>

462
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brilliant.</v>

463
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:12.170
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely brilliant study of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that a value system holds you </v>

464
00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:16.290
<v Speaker 1>together even in ways that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

465
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.920
<v Speaker 1>And then if you step outside of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

466
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:23.100
<v Speaker 1>and violate your relationship to it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some really intense way,</v>

467
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:28.370
<v Speaker 1>then there's going to be catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological consequences that will </v>

468
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:29.070
<v Speaker 1>echo through your whole being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

469
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 1>we know that this is more than theory </v>
<v Speaker 1>because many people,</v>

470
00:28:34.231 --> 00:28:37.740
<v Speaker 1>soldiers in particular who develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

471
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:43.070
<v Speaker 1>develop posttraumatic stress disorder </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they observe themselves doing </v>

472
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.211
<v Speaker 1>something that they regard as </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously cruel or vicious or </v>

473
00:28:47.211 --> 00:28:47.730
<v Speaker 1>immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

474
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.520
<v Speaker 1>when they're in the situation where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

475
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting that acting in that manner is </v>

476
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.611
<v Speaker 1>highly probable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a war situation usually very </v>

477
00:28:58.611 --> 00:28:58.611
<v Speaker 1>intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

478
00:28:58.611 --> 00:29:00.180
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a lot of time to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

479
00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:05.160
<v Speaker 1>And God only knows what the specifics </v>
<v Speaker 1>are of the particular event.</v>

480
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:10.490
<v Speaker 1>But many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people come to be so shattered by </v>

481
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:15.111
<v Speaker 1>observing themselves do things they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't believe that a human being would </v>

482
00:29:15.111 --> 00:29:16.260
<v Speaker 1>be capable of doing that they never </v>
<v Speaker 1>recovered,</v>

483
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because you know they </v>
<v Speaker 1>violate their,</v>

484
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:25.370
<v Speaker 1>their ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ethical structure that holds them </v>

485
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.941
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holds older ideas and their plans and </v>

486
00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:30.750
<v Speaker 1>their perceptions and their interactions</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people.</v>

487
00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:35.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a unified field in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you violate it and it fragments,</v>

488
00:29:35.341 --> 00:29:38.080
<v Speaker 1>then you're left absolutely fragmented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's,</v>

489
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:43.130
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not even a psychological </v>

490
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.810
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a psychophysiological observation.</v>

491
00:29:43.811 --> 00:29:48.811
<v Speaker 1>You can stress yourself so badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise your stress level so high that </v>

492
00:29:48.811 --> 00:29:52.600
<v Speaker 1>your brain starts to become damaged by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress hormones and you know,</v>

493
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:55.930
<v Speaker 1>so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a psychological state,</v>

494
00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:00.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's damaged to the core of your being </v>

495
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.811
<v Speaker 1>in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the collapse of these belief systems</v>

496
00:30:05.981 --> 00:30:10.450
<v Speaker 1>and their destabilization was well </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought through by these thinkers by the</v>

497
00:30:10.451 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 1>end of the 19th century.</v>

498
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.740
<v Speaker 1>And then we have the technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations and the and the </v>

499
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 1>sociological and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations of the early part of the</v>

500
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:25.111
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That leaves everyone in a state of </v>

501
00:30:25.111 --> 00:30:27.250
<v Speaker 1>confusion in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in Germany in the 19 twenties,</v>

502
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:32.251
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans had gone through this </v>

503
00:30:32.251 --> 00:30:33.220
<v Speaker 1>terrible period of trench warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're all there.</v>

504
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:38.221
<v Speaker 1>Men were brutalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them had been on the front for </v>

505
00:30:38.221 --> 00:30:38.290
<v Speaker 1>months and that was in the trenches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

506
00:30:38.291 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Speaker 1>their political system had collapsed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd put a week,</v>

507
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:46.020
<v Speaker 1>weekly rooted democracy in place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the economic system collapsed in </v>

508
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went through a period of hyperinflation.</v>

509
00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:51.961
<v Speaker 1>So that money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the value of their money basically </v>

510
00:30:51.961 --> 00:30:55.291
<v Speaker 1>dropped to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that meant that if he were 65 </v>

511
00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:59.281
<v Speaker 1>years old and had saved up your whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life to have enough money to retire and </v>

512
00:30:59.281 --> 00:30:59.650
<v Speaker 1>we're a good citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

513
00:30:59.651 --> 00:31:01.060
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and prudent and careful.</v>

514
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Every single thing you ever own </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

515
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.450
<v Speaker 1>And so at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

516
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:12.690
<v Speaker 1>the communist revolution had taken place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Soviet Russia and there was great </v>

517
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.250
<v Speaker 1>concern within Germany that the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing was likely to happen there.</v>

518
00:31:15.251 --> 00:31:20.251
<v Speaker 1>And certainly the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the communists were always pushing for </v>

519
00:31:20.251 --> 00:31:24.091
<v Speaker 1>that because they had the common term </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the international communist </v>

520
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:25.960
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was devoted towards destabilizing,</v>

521
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non communist governments and,</v>

522
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Speaker 1>and producing the preconditions for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

523
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:36.481
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't like it was just paranoia was a </v>

524
00:31:36.481 --> 00:31:36.850
<v Speaker 1>real threat and it was out of all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>mess that came,</v>

525
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.250
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of the fascists and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>

526
00:31:39.251 --> 00:31:40.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

527
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that surprising because chaos </v>

528
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.490
<v Speaker 1>breeds the desire for order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was what,</v>

529
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.410
<v Speaker 1>that was one direction that people could</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

530
00:31:50.411 --> 00:31:55.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of following an abstract </v>

531
00:31:55.411 --> 00:31:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say this sort of idea that was </v>

532
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.781
<v Speaker 1>embedded in classical Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized the new Messiah not was </v>

533
00:32:00.781 --> 00:32:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Hitler.</v>

534
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:06.270
<v Speaker 1>And that certainly didn't seem to be any</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement because Hitler was really a </v>

535
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 1>messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction and fire.</v>

536
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:13.470
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the World War Two killed about $120 </v>

537
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.591
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it left Germany in </v>

538
00:32:16.591 --> 00:32:18.631
<v Speaker 1>absolute ruins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Hitler killed himself in his bunker </v>

539
00:32:18.631 --> 00:32:21.841
<v Speaker 1>underneath Berlin while it was burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Russians were advancing into </v>

540
00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:21.841
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

541
00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:23.080
<v Speaker 1>into Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were not happy.</v>

542
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.560
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want to be a German national.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

543
00:32:26.561 --> 00:32:28.960
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets were advancing towards you </v>
<v Speaker 1>after your,</v>

544
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:34.290
<v Speaker 1>after your country to invaded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's pushed them back halfway across </v>

545
00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:34.600
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

546
00:32:34.601 --> 00:32:37.290
<v Speaker 1>and produced a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage and,</v>

547
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>and distress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an awful situation,</v>

548
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:41.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

549
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.200
<v Speaker 1>the Messiah is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Russians turned to Lenin and </v>

550
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Stalin were barbaric and brutal beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehension.</v>

551
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

552
00:32:51.991 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

553
00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 1>we're not very well educated in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in this,</v>

554
00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.510
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union in the 20th century.</v>

555
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:04.510
<v Speaker 1>We know far more about what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany say with the Holocaust and you </v>

556
00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:08.700
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important that people should </v>

557
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.391
<v Speaker 1>know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there were tens of millions of </v>

558
00:33:10.391 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 1>people brutally destroyed in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

559
00:33:10.851 --> 00:33:15.851
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because they were murdered by </v>

560
00:33:15.851 --> 00:33:17.780
<v Speaker 1>people who were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>

561
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 1>motivated by left wing Utopian visions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We seem to.</v>

562
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Our education system seems to regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as somehow more forgivable,</v>

563
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.550
<v Speaker 1>which it certainly isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

564
00:33:31.551 --> 00:33:36.551
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole generate secular alternatives </v>

565
00:33:36.551 --> 00:33:38.240
<v Speaker 1>to religious belief issue didn't seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out very well.</v>

566
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:43.180
<v Speaker 1>And then the nihilism alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that has its own problems.</v>

567
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.090
<v Speaker 1>One problem is the sort of Dostoevsky </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about,</v>

568
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:52.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see the kids who go up and </v>

569
00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.431
<v Speaker 1>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot up high schools and exploded in </v>

570
00:33:54.431 --> 00:33:54.460
<v Speaker 1>rage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

571
00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:57.470
<v Speaker 1>they're often people who feel that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no meaning in their life,</v>

572
00:33:57.471 --> 00:34:02.471
<v Speaker 1>that life itself is contemptible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that suffering is too extreme and that </v>

573
00:34:02.471 --> 00:34:02.471
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

574
00:34:02.471 --> 00:34:07.230
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bear the brunt of unfair reality </v>

575
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they develop unbelievably dark and,</v>

576
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:14.830
<v Speaker 1>and destructive theories of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of revenge and mayhem over sometimes </v>

577
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 1>over the period of years.</v>

578
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:21.250
<v Speaker 1>And then they go up in the world and lay</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things out and it's not like </v>

579
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:24.950
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking is irrational know it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coherent.</v>

580
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:30.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just predicated on principles that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not agree with such as the </v>

581
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:32.060
<v Speaker 1>principle that everyone that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like deserves to die.</v>

582
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.740
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of a really formal way of</v>

583
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:41.990
<v Speaker 1>demonstrating that such thoughts are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only immoral but wrong.</v>

584
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some absolute sense.</v>

585
00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:47.810
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to come up with ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>of defending ourselves against those two</v>

586
00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:51.110
<v Speaker 1>extremes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extremes of destructive vitalism and</v>

587
00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:55.310
<v Speaker 1>the extremes of ideological possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

588
00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:01.210
<v Speaker 1>nature started to work out some some </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions to this and I just started to </v>

589
00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:03.470
<v Speaker 1>touch on those at the end of the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture,</v>

590
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky solution was a return to </v>

591
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Christianity fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's revivification and that was the</v>

592
00:35:12.471 --> 00:35:17.471
<v Speaker 1>same tack that Alexander Soldier Nixon </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempted to lay out and also tolstoy in</v>

593
00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>

594
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll talk to you about that a little</v>

595
00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:26.561
<v Speaker 1>bit more in the next lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dusty or niches idea was that people </v>

596
00:35:26.561 --> 00:35:26.780
<v Speaker 1>would have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

597
00:35:26.781 --> 00:35:28.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when his quote about the death of God,</v>

598
00:35:28.611 --> 00:35:33.611
<v Speaker 1>that people would have to become light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's just to be able to tolerate the </v>

599
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:39.390
<v Speaker 1>consequences of this dismemberment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the previous civilization.</v>

600
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And he believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

601
00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.230
<v Speaker 1>his thinking on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is somewhat fragmentary.</v>

602
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:51.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature was a great critic of </v>

603
00:35:51.231 --> 00:35:54.081
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutionalized Christianity and a </v>

604
00:35:54.081 --> 00:35:55.830
<v Speaker 1>great diagnostician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could say what was rotten at the core</v>

605
00:35:55.831 --> 00:35:59.520
<v Speaker 1>of western civilization will say modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

606
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.960
<v Speaker 1>but when it came to actually describing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do about it,</v>

607
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't live that long.</v>

608
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:07.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he died a fairly young man.</v>

609
00:36:07.681 --> 00:36:11.520
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a video of meets you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mental hospital online.</v>

610
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I just found it the other night.</v>

611
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.540
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea that he was ever captured</v>
<v Speaker 1>on video,</v>

612
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:20.541
<v Speaker 1>but there's video from a movie from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>1899 showing him in the mental hospital </v>

613
00:36:20.821 --> 00:36:25.821
<v Speaker 1>where he ended up in his early forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he talked about the development of </v>

614
00:36:26.341 --> 00:36:28.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the being.</v>

615
00:36:28.261 --> 00:36:33.261
<v Speaker 1>He called the overmanned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is often translated as superman </v>

616
00:36:33.261 --> 00:36:37.581
<v Speaker 1>and his idea was that people would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take onto themselves the the burden </v>

617
00:36:39.061 --> 00:36:44.061
<v Speaker 1>of creating new systems of meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>new morality's that were suited to them </v>

618
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.950
<v Speaker 1>that they would have to create new </v>
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

619
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young took niches,</v>

620
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.470
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very seriously and you can.</v>

621
00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:01.640
<v Speaker 1>You can certainly say that young was as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much influenced by niche as he was by </v>

622
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.481
<v Speaker 1>Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say in some ways he was </v>

623
00:37:05.481 --> 00:37:07.620
<v Speaker 1>influenced more because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that yoga was trying to do was to</v>

624
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:10.980
<v Speaker 1>identify where the last values had gone.</v>

625
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>So the Nietzschean idea is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible for human beings to create </v>

626
00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:21.390
<v Speaker 1>their own values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a problem with that.</v>

627
00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a variety of problems with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one is that it's,</v>

628
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.790
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem exactly true in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

629
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:34.791
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the existentialists who </v>

630
00:37:34.791 --> 00:37:34.791
<v Speaker 1>followed each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like John Paul Sartre,</v>

631
00:37:34.791 --> 00:37:36.390
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed in the radical freedom of human</v>

632
00:37:36.391 --> 00:37:40.830
<v Speaker 1>beings that we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were doomed to be free in a sense.</v>

633
00:37:40.831 --> 00:37:45.831
<v Speaker 1>And that was absolutely necessary for us</v>
<v Speaker 1>to conjure up our own meanings and </v>

634
00:37:45.831 --> 00:37:49.180
<v Speaker 1>values because fundamentally we faced </v>
<v Speaker 1>the void and you know,</v>

635
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.220
<v Speaker 1>life was nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutish and short to use hobbs terms.</v>

636
00:37:53.221 --> 00:37:57.240
<v Speaker 1>And that we had to be able to confront </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and live despite it.</v>

637
00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.080
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variety of problems with that </v>

638
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:03.080
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one is,</v>

639
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you come up with your system of </v>

640
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.910
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason.</v>

641
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.780
<v Speaker 1>And I come up with mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to assume that they're</v>

642
00:38:09.781 --> 00:38:14.781
<v Speaker 1>going to be sufficiently integratable so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't have to fight each other </v>

643
00:38:14.781 --> 00:38:15.930
<v Speaker 1>to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>

644
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:20.931
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have every single person with </v>

645
00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:20.931
<v Speaker 1>their own system of beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

646
00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:22.710
<v Speaker 1>fine extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that?</v>

647
00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:26.010
<v Speaker 1>In a sense that's a structured kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophical anarchy.</v>

648
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

649
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's good if you have to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone on an island,</v>

650
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but if you're stuck with all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

651
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.920
<v Speaker 1>then that becomes a very difficult thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

652
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.790
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's partly for that reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Sartre famously said,</v>

653
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.420
<v Speaker 1>hell is other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

654
00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:47.430
<v Speaker 1>because he thought of the other in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that which was not him as an </v>

655
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:51.830
<v Speaker 1>oppressive forest that stopped him from </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting his destiny in the way that </v>

656
00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 1>would have been best for him.</v>

657
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

658
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.790
<v Speaker 1>hell might be other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that,</v>

659
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:03.870
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very one sided way of looking </v>

660
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:04.840
<v Speaker 1>at things because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is other people hell is you too.</v>

661
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:09.841
<v Speaker 1>When you know hell is nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of places you could find </v>

662
00:39:09.841 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 1>hail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>

663
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most meaningful elements of people's</v>

664
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:18.781
<v Speaker 1>lives are often their social </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and you can't lay </v>

665
00:39:18.781 --> 00:39:19.990
<v Speaker 1>everything at the door of pathological </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

666
00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:25.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we shouldn't forget as well that </v>

667
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Sartre didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

668
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:30.180
<v Speaker 1>what come up with any reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique of the communists until the </v>

669
00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 1>late 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

670
00:39:31.271 --> 00:39:32.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was a little late.</v>

671
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.800
<v Speaker 1>People with any sense like George Orwell</v>
<v Speaker 1>had figured out that the whole Soviet </v>

672
00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 1>experiment had become radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous by the early 19 forties.</v>

673
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:47.530
<v Speaker 1>And so starcher proposed radical freedom</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

674
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:52.830
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the existential response to the </v>

675
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:54.100
<v Speaker 1>unveiling of no meaning.</v>

676
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.180
<v Speaker 1>But when it came right down to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't resist identification with a</v>

677
00:39:58.181 --> 00:40:03.181
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't see any reason why we should </v>

678
00:40:03.181 --> 00:40:03.430
<v Speaker 1>really pay any attention to what he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say.</v>

679
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:08.980
<v Speaker 1>So now there's another problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that people should create their own</v>

680
00:40:08.981 --> 00:40:10.480
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is the,</v>

681
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not so simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

682
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.810
<v Speaker 1>and the problem seems to be is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't obey yourself very well.</v>

683
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

684
00:40:18.311 --> 00:40:19.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's my code.</v>

685
00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:24.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we let's do that simply to begin </v>

686
00:40:24.931 --> 00:40:24.931
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

687
00:40:24.931 --> 00:40:27.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to study very hard and do well</v>

688
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:29.980
<v Speaker 1>at my classes just for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>

689
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know.</v>

690
00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:37.290
<v Speaker 1>You procrastinate and you have a paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to read and you know </v>

691
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:40.621
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to read it and you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to read it for reasons that are even </v>

692
00:40:40.621 --> 00:40:44.131
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically important to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no damn way you can get </v>

693
00:40:44.131 --> 00:40:44.131
<v Speaker 1>yourself to sit down and read it.</v>

694
00:40:44.131 --> 00:40:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Your attention wanders and you go to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>three or four stupid things and you feel</v>

695
00:40:48.401 --> 00:40:53.401
<v Speaker 1>terrible about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you feel like you're betraying </v>

696
00:40:53.401 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>yourself and maybe this is a continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern in your life,</v>

697
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:59.100
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things you find out is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't get to create your own </v>

698
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.570
<v Speaker 1>damn values because for some reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in charge of yourself.</v>

699
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:05.140
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic ideas start to come from.</v>

700
00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:06.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freud notices.</v>

701
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.520
<v Speaker 1>This is in the aftermath of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not the master of your own </v>

702
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.460
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that there's,</v>

703
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:17.640
<v Speaker 1>there's many sub use inside of you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't all want the same thing and </v>

704
00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:22.270
<v Speaker 1>so the idea that you can generate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own meaning is very,</v>

705
00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:27.580
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insufficiently developed idea </v>

706
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.840
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of meaning making </v>
<v Speaker 1>generators residing within you and not </v>

707
00:41:33.201 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 1>only do they not all point in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

708
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't even necessarily.</v>

709
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.320
<v Speaker 1>They don't necessarily lay themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in some integrated fashion across </v>

710
00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.440
<v Speaker 1>time and they don't necessarily operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in a way that's going to enable</v>

711
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you to find your place with other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in society.</v>

712
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.370
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make your own meaning well,</v>

713
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:56.720
<v Speaker 1>which part of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

714
00:41:56.721 --> 00:42:00.020
<v Speaker 1>you're not a unified thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a big problem.</v>

715
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.950
<v Speaker 1>And then all these other problems just </v>
<v Speaker 1>remain unaddressed completely.</v>

716
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one answer to that,</v>

717
00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 1>and this is the answer that the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical existentialists took as well.</v>

718
00:42:10.641 --> 00:42:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Society has to be reconfigured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

719
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:18.510
<v Speaker 1>we kind of know where that leads to when</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are doing radical societal </v>

720
00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:22.841
<v Speaker 1>reconfiguration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least as far as we've been able to </v>

721
00:42:22.841 --> 00:42:25.541
<v Speaker 1>tell most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an absolute murderous </v>

722
00:42:25.541 --> 00:42:27.230
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

723
00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:32.231
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems reasonable to me to presume </v>

724
00:42:32.231 --> 00:42:32.330
<v Speaker 1>that that those experiments have already</v>
<v Speaker 1>been run.</v>

725
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:38.560
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you like Dostoevsky was very </v>

726
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:44.351
<v Speaker 1>interested in returning to sources of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning from which he believed that our </v>

727
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:47.720
<v Speaker 1>original religious ideas had emerged.</v>

728
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.450
<v Speaker 1>And this is partly his notion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective unconscious.</v>

729
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:55.870
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the radical critique of </v>

730
00:42:55.870 --> 00:43:00.191
<v Speaker 1>religious systems is predicated on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that there's something like </v>

731
00:43:00.191 --> 00:43:03.911
<v Speaker 1>conscious beliefs are articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs that you could lay out in a </v>

732
00:43:03.911 --> 00:43:05.600
<v Speaker 1>credo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

733
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be correct at all.</v>

734
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:13.271
<v Speaker 1>And Nietzsche actually knew this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew that a lot of our social </v>

735
00:43:13.271 --> 00:43:16.481
<v Speaker 1>institutions had emerged from the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and it only become articulated after </v>

736
00:43:16.791 --> 00:43:19.250
<v Speaker 1>they'd been embodied and danced out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>

737
00:43:19.251 --> 00:43:24.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a tribal group learns how to </v>

738
00:43:24.251 --> 00:43:28.331
<v Speaker 1>organize itself over thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years of trial and error </v>

739
00:43:28.331 --> 00:43:29.180
<v Speaker 1>and pushing against each other and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

740
00:43:29.181 --> 00:43:34.181
<v Speaker 1>And they come into that tribal grouping </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a biological substrate and there </v>

741
00:43:34.181 --> 00:43:38.861
<v Speaker 1>are sociological and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions are constrained by all of </v>

742
00:43:38.861 --> 00:43:43.811
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe they come up with a </v>

743
00:43:43.811 --> 00:43:45.821
<v Speaker 1>description of that over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the self description and an articulated </v>

744
00:43:45.821 --> 00:43:45.821
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

745
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's the religious system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that the religious system is </v>

746
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:54.560
<v Speaker 1>thought up first as a system of </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical presuppositions,</v>

747
00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:59.590
<v Speaker 1>images and dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then turn it into rules then imposed on </v>

748
00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.120
<v Speaker 1>the population who then obeys it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generally speaking,</v>

749
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:04.530
<v Speaker 1>when people criticized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

750
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.370
<v Speaker 1>formal religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they criticized it,</v>

751
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.650
<v Speaker 1>assuming that that's how it had </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>

752
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:11.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of a Marxist idea,</v>

753
00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:16.541
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that religion is the opiate of the </v>

754
00:44:16.541 --> 00:44:16.541
<v Speaker 1>masses and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

755
00:44:16.541 --> 00:44:20.201
<v Speaker 1>the religious structures were laid out </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that a small elite could control the </v>

756
00:44:20.201 --> 00:44:21.200
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

757
00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:23.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in virtually every domain,</v>

758
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.370
<v Speaker 1>a small elite emerges that dominates the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

759
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what domain you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mark's is accurate in that way,</v>

760
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.460
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.520
<v Speaker 1>there's always a power imbalance between</v>
<v Speaker 1>elite minority and majority.</v>

762
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:46.700
<v Speaker 1>But to say that that's the cause of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the systems that people interact within </v>

763
00:44:48.951 --> 00:44:49.990
<v Speaker 1>is wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

764
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:51.260
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

765
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm sophisticated beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it does is it takes phenomena.</v>

766
00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:58.700
<v Speaker 1>There are complex beyond comprehension </v>
<v Speaker 1>and reduce them to one thing.</v>

767
00:44:58.701 --> 00:45:00.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

768
00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:01.610
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>

769
00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

770
00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sampled popular songs on the,</v>

771
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:14.840
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you made a graph of how </v>

772
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.001
<v Speaker 1>popular songs were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you find is that about 10 songs at </v>

773
00:45:17.001 --> 00:45:19.560
<v Speaker 1>any given time are played,</v>

774
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:26.290
<v Speaker 1>half of all the songs played at any </v>
<v Speaker 1>given time are going to be one of 10 </v>

775
00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.160
<v Speaker 1>songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

776
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.200
<v Speaker 1>and then what the other thing you'd find</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that half of all songs played are </v>

777
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:35.450
<v Speaker 1>played by one or more of 10 musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's true,</v>

778
00:45:35.451 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 1>no matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

779
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.870
<v Speaker 1>if you look all the way from the 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>32 now,</v>

780
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.180
<v Speaker 1>if you look at popular music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the same thing.</v>

781
00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything that almost everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>listens to is created by very few </v>

782
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.030
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's millions of musicians,</v>

783
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.030
<v Speaker 1>but you've never heard of most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll never hear a song.</v>

784
00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.250
<v Speaker 1>For most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a small minority.</v>

785
00:45:55.251 --> 00:45:58.190
<v Speaker 1>And what you see as in any field of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative production,</v>

786
00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:03.490
<v Speaker 1>this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A small elite emerges and dominates the </v>

787
00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:05.270
<v Speaker 1>entire landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

788
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

789
00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:12.070
<v Speaker 1>it would be kind of ridiculous to assume</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the 10 most popular singers and </v>

790
00:46:12.141 --> 00:46:14.350
<v Speaker 1>musicians that are currently operative </v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

791
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.050
<v Speaker 1>those who gave rise to the system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed them to thrive.</v>

792
00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:21.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously that's a dopey idea and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

793
00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:22.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

794
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:27.370
<v Speaker 1>it's no more an intelligent idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at any other domain where </v>

795
00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:30.020
<v Speaker 1>there's tremendous variation and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergence of an elite,</v>

796
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:32.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a very common phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens,</v>

797
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:34.190
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens anywhere.</v>

798
00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:37.580
<v Speaker 1>There's creative production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's why one percent of the people,</v>

799
00:46:37.581 --> 00:46:38.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly half,</v>

800
00:46:38.451 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no different in,</v>

801
00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:45.770
<v Speaker 1>in other creative domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we'll talk later in the course about</v>

802
00:46:45.771 --> 00:46:50.771
<v Speaker 1>why that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to think it's because those people </v>

803
00:46:50.771 --> 00:46:51.860
<v Speaker 1>set up the system so that they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrive this.</v>

804
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an element of that obviously </v>

805
00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.611
<v Speaker 1>because once you're rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to prefer political </v>

806
00:47:00.611 --> 00:47:04.481
<v Speaker 1>policies that helped you stay rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that you set up </v>

807
00:47:04.481 --> 00:47:05.720
<v Speaker 1>the whole damn system that made you rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>

808
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same people over any </v>

809
00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:10.840
<v Speaker 1>reasonable span of time.</v>

810
00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.070
<v Speaker 1>So the one percent of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the money,</v>

811
00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:18.220
<v Speaker 1>it's always one percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same people each in </v>

812
00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.830
<v Speaker 1>individuals tend to hold onto money for </v>
<v Speaker 1>very short periods of time and big </v>

813
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:23.790
<v Speaker 1>companies don't last very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

814
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.270
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they last on average about 30,</v>

815
00:47:26.271 --> 00:47:28.190
<v Speaker 1>35,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years and that's it.</v>

816
00:47:28.191 --> 00:47:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Then they disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does,</v>

817
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:35.230
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economic landscape is just churning </v>

818
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.790
<v Speaker 1>like Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for a company to,</v>

819
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:42.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not that many big steam coach </v>

820
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:42.180
<v Speaker 1>companies anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

821
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:42.180
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

822
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:46.951
<v Speaker 1>and nobody makes zepplins and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes typewriters and you know what I </v>

823
00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:51.721
<v Speaker 1>mean is things move quick and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you dominated the landscape at </v>

824
00:47:51.721 --> 00:47:55.261
<v Speaker 1>one particular moment doesn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be able to do it that </v>

825
00:47:55.261 --> 00:47:55.261
<v Speaker 1>the next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

826
00:47:55.261 --> 00:48:00.130
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the create your own meaning thing is </v>

827
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:00.130
<v Speaker 1>a rough one.</v>

828
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:03.660
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what makes you think you have </v>

829
00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.690
<v Speaker 1>enough time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

830
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:10.740
<v Speaker 1>lots of times people come to me and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have relationship problems and part of </v>

831
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the problem is is that they've set their</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships up outside of social norms</v>

832
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:16.330
<v Speaker 1>and they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

833
00:48:16.331 --> 00:48:18.190
<v Speaker 1>so they'll say something to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

834
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:23.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to get married because </v>

835
00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.081
<v Speaker 1>marriage is just a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really a stupid thing to say </v>

836
00:48:25.081 --> 00:48:25.960
<v Speaker 1>like it's an incredibly stupid thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

837
00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:31.140
<v Speaker 1>but underneath that there's this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they want to remain free of social </v>

838
00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.400
<v Speaker 1>constraints so that they can negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own way.</v>

839
00:48:33.401 --> 00:48:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're giving them credit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting freedom instead of just escaping</v>

840
00:48:37.061 --> 00:48:39.700
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is it's like,</v>

841
00:48:39.701 --> 00:48:41.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

842
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why you would assume that </v>

843
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:50.131
<v Speaker 1>you have enough time in the 30 or 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years that you're going to be pursuing </v>

844
00:48:50.131 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 1>relationships to actually figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should run.</v>

845
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a hope of that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse too because very,</v>

846
00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:59.880
<v Speaker 1>very few people can negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

847
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.980
<v Speaker 1>because here's the way it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either adhere to the social order or</v>

848
00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:09.940
<v Speaker 1>you stand outside as soon as you stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of it,</v>

849
00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:14.941
<v Speaker 1>you're in a chaotic place because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no guidelines and then you </v>

850
00:49:14.941 --> 00:49:18.691
<v Speaker 1>either live chaotically because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no guidelines or you start to formulate </v>

851
00:49:19.031 --> 00:49:22.990
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to do that you have to know what you</v>

852
00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:27.991
<v Speaker 1>want and you have to know how to express</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then you have to figure out what </v>

853
00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:31.810
<v Speaker 1>your partner wants and help them express</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

854
00:49:31.811 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to negotiate a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

855
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say one in 20 people know how to</v>

856
00:49:38.471 --> 00:49:40.660
<v Speaker 1>negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

857
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:43.000
<v Speaker 1>really difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you mean just think of the steps.</v>

858
00:49:43.001 --> 00:49:48.001
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to know what you want and then </v>

859
00:49:48.001 --> 00:49:48.001
<v Speaker 1>you have to admit it to yourself.</v>

860
00:49:48.001 --> 00:49:48.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

861
00:49:48.001 --> 00:49:48.880
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

862
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:50.950
<v Speaker 1>you're not even going to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first one.</v>

863
00:49:50.951 --> 00:49:52.930
<v Speaker 1>In all likelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

864
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.350
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what you want can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulated even,</v>

865
00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>

866
00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:03.870
<v Speaker 1>So there's a great study done awhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>back on the prediction of mayor of,</v>

867
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.570
<v Speaker 1>of a relationship longevity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

868
00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:10.490
<v Speaker 1>So here was the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

869
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.820
<v Speaker 1>how many negative interactions do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have per set of positive?</v>

870
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Sorry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many positive interactions per </v>

871
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.911
<v Speaker 1>negative interaction do you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your partner in order for the </v>

872
00:50:23.911 --> 00:50:25.870
<v Speaker 1>relationship to remain stable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

873
00:50:25.871 --> 00:50:30.871
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you have one negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction to every one positive </v>

874
00:50:30.871 --> 00:50:31.400
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

875
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe have 10 negatives to every </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

876
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Then you could imagine a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where you have 100 positive to</v>

877
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:39.830
<v Speaker 1>one negative spanning the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

878
00:50:39.831 --> 00:50:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Continue and you use that to predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship satisfaction and longevity.</v>

879
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:49.840
<v Speaker 1>While you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well God obviously 100 positive to one </v>

880
00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.220
<v Speaker 1>negative is where is the preferable </v>
<v Speaker 1>ratio?</v>

881
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:54.500
<v Speaker 1>And so it's those people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

882
00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:58.670
<v Speaker 1>their relationship is nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant compliments and bliss.</v>

883
00:50:58.671 --> 00:51:00.710
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones who last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>

884
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:03.700
<v Speaker 1>What you see is that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

885
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:07.880
<v Speaker 1>an optimal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an optimal ratio domain.</v>

886
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:12.170
<v Speaker 1>If it falls below five to one positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to negative,</v>

887
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 1>then your relationship falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too negative.</v>

888
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because people feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion more than they feel </v>

889
00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.000
<v Speaker 1>positive emotions because you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt more than you can be.</v>

890
00:51:23.001 --> 00:51:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Pleased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one that's only five to one is to</v>

891
00:51:26.781 --> 00:51:29.330
<v Speaker 1>punishing and people won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't stay in.</v>

892
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:34.460
<v Speaker 1>But if you get above 11 to one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets not punishing enough.</v>

893
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.380
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

894
00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:38.300
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

895
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.460
<v Speaker 1>what do you want in a relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

896
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:42.470
<v Speaker 1>you think bliss.</v>

897
00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like that isn't what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

898
00:51:44.691 --> 00:51:46.880
<v Speaker 1>it's more like you want someone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contend with,</v>

899
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to push over.</v>

900
00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:51.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't want everything to be easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

901
00:51:51.471 --> 00:51:56.471
<v Speaker 1>and this is the sort of the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that kierkegaard was talking </v>

902
00:51:56.751 --> 00:52:01.751
<v Speaker 1>about when he talked about deciding to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things more difficult for people </v>

903
00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:02.000
<v Speaker 1>because that's what they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

904
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:06.080
<v Speaker 1>you know this perfectly well because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go out with someone and they worship</v>

905
00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:11.081
<v Speaker 1>you and they don't on your every word </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing but positive </v>

906
00:52:11.081 --> 00:52:14.650
<v Speaker 1>feedback coming from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose respect for them almost an </v>

907
00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:17.531
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you go wander off and find someone </v>

908
00:52:17.531 --> 00:52:19.751
<v Speaker 1>who's more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason for that I think </v>

909
00:52:19.751 --> 00:52:23.411
<v Speaker 1>is that you want the person that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>with to challenge you so that not only </v>

910
00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:27.260
<v Speaker 1>do you do reasonably well data gate day </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

911
00:52:27.261 --> 00:52:32.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can coexist in the same space </v>

912
00:52:32.261 --> 00:52:35.501
<v Speaker 1>with a reasonable amount of pace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also want there to be enough </v>

913
00:52:35.501 --> 00:52:38.891
<v Speaker 1>tension in the relationship so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're both involved in a process of </v>

914
00:52:38.891 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 1>mutual transformation while try </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifying that in an articulated way,</v>

915
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:44.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck,</v>

916
00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:49.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also explains strange things </v>

917
00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:50.900
<v Speaker 1>about people like the fact that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in pretty negative relationships.</v>

918
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what the hell are you doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had articulated it two years ago </v>

919
00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:56.150
<v Speaker 1>and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

920
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:59.390
<v Speaker 1>I want to be with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm miserable with half the time,</v>

921
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:01.760
<v Speaker 1>of course you're never going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

922
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:04.040
<v Speaker 1>but it could easily be that that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're after.</v>

923
00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.410
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

924
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:12.250
<v Speaker 1>so alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now heidegger is another philosopher who</v>

925
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
<v Speaker 1>was attempting in some sense to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problems that were laid out by </v>

926
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.651
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche and Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that heidegger heidegger </v>

927
00:53:23.651 --> 00:53:28.230
<v Speaker 1>began to resolve them was by a radically</v>
<v Speaker 1>new lookout philosophy itself,</v>

928
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:32.310
<v Speaker 1>and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

929
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:37.640
<v Speaker 1>he was one of the prime phenomenologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I told you a while back that the </v>

930
00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.051
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists decided to reconstitute</v>
<v Speaker 1>western philosophy.</v>

931
00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:45.630
<v Speaker 1>So that was focusing on being instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

932
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:51.080
<v Speaker 1>And so the hardest thing to grasp about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists is what exactly </v>

933
00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.120
<v Speaker 1>they meant by being an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you a,</v>

934
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a overview of that.</v>

935
00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:01.520
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the term Dad's side </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from and that's a German term and </v>

936
00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.941
<v Speaker 1>it means being there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so right now you're encapsulated in </v>

937
00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:08.421
<v Speaker 1>a data site and the design is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>totality of your experience and that </v>

938
00:54:09.331 --> 00:54:12.870
<v Speaker 1>experience would be an experience of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>extended world,</v>

939
00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 1>the natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the social world.</v>

940
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:23.810
<v Speaker 1>And then inside that the world of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective experience and that </v>

941
00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:27.810
<v Speaker 1>constitutes being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the phenomenologists make the case.</v>

942
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.590
<v Speaker 1>They're not playing this subject object </v>
<v Speaker 1>gate and they're standing outside of the</v>

943
00:54:31.591 --> 00:54:36.591
<v Speaker 1>division between subject and object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the scientific world </v>

944
00:54:36.591 --> 00:54:39.661
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a real paradigm shift in that </v>

945
00:54:39.661 --> 00:54:43.761
<v Speaker 1>you can't use the rules from the old way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of looking at things inside the new way </v>

946
00:54:43.761 --> 00:54:48.291
<v Speaker 1>of looking at things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to start with new </v>

947
00:54:48.291 --> 00:54:48.291
<v Speaker 1>presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we might say,</v>

948
00:54:48.291 --> 00:54:52.161
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you're going to </v>

949
00:54:52.161 --> 00:54:52.230
<v Speaker 1>do if you look at things </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologically,</v>

950
00:54:52.231 --> 00:54:55.290
<v Speaker 1>is to assume that everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced is real.</v>

951
00:54:56.490 --> 00:55:01.490
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then we would say that there's no </v>

952
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:05.130
<v Speaker 1>attempt in that phenomenal logical world</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reduce pain to something material.</v>

953
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Pain stands as stands itself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena,</v>

954
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:11.670
<v Speaker 1>so does anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so does joy.</v>

955
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:16.430
<v Speaker 1>All the things that the scientists of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness called Kaleo,</v>

956
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:20.850
<v Speaker 1>which are viewed by them as qualities of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objective world,</v>

957
00:55:20.851 --> 00:55:23.010
<v Speaker 1>aren't viewed that way by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists.</v>

958
00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 1>They just say those are primary elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>

959
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:32.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very interesting way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things because it kind of </v>

960
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:33.960
<v Speaker 1>allows you to reclaim the validity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own experience.</v>

961
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:35.490
<v Speaker 1>You can no longer say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

962
00:55:35.491 --> 00:55:40.491
<v Speaker 1>that's only subjective and that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that everything you played </v>

963
00:55:40.491 --> 00:55:45.350
<v Speaker 1>subjectively is true objectively or for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

964
00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:50.960
<v Speaker 1>What it does mean is that everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you experience subjectively is </v>

965
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.780
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

966
00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:56.781
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to not think about it or take </v>

967
00:55:56.781 --> 00:55:56.781
<v Speaker 1>it apart or categorize it properly.</v>

968
00:55:56.781 --> 00:55:57.870
<v Speaker 1>You still have to do all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

969
00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.440
<v Speaker 1>but you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're put into a place where there is </v>

970
00:56:03.601 --> 00:56:08.601
<v Speaker 1>no need to deny the reality of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience or to subordinate it to </v>

971
00:56:08.601 --> 00:56:11.220
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

972
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:13.740
<v Speaker 1>if I'm doing dream analysis with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

973
00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:16.530
<v Speaker 1>which I do often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people dream,</v>

974
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:21.100
<v Speaker 1>because dreams as you pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there they are.</v>

975
00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:24.610
<v Speaker 1>They're manifestations of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't come up with them.</v>

976
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:29.910
<v Speaker 1>They appear to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sort of appear out of nowhere in </v>

977
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:30.550
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They manifest themselves.</v>

978
00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It strangely began and I think the </v>

979
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.630
<v Speaker 1>reason for that is that they contain </v>
<v Speaker 1>unarticulated thought,</v>

980
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 1>but if you can get a handle on them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>assess them,</v>

981
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:45.130
<v Speaker 1>then sometimes they can tell you things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no other way you can figure</v>

982
00:56:45.131 --> 00:56:50.131
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's really cool about them is </v>

983
00:56:50.131 --> 00:56:52.021
<v Speaker 1>that they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the same impersonality as </v>

984
00:56:52.571 --> 00:56:57.571
<v Speaker 1>phenomena in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the broader world of experience.</v>

985
00:56:58.061 --> 00:57:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Have you know you don't ever think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth of a chair,</v>

986
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 1>it's just there and dreams are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

987
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:09.481
<v Speaker 1>They're just there and if you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>untangle what they have to what they </v>

988
00:57:09.481 --> 00:57:14.041
<v Speaker 1>indicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can get a take on your own </v>

989
00:57:14.041 --> 00:57:14.470
<v Speaker 1>experience that's not</v>

990
00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:23.120
<v Speaker 1>altered by any of your local subjective </v>
<v Speaker 1>wishes and desires.</v>

991
00:57:23.121 --> 00:57:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I hate to use the word subjective in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of context.</v>

992
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:31.490
<v Speaker 1>So phenomenology is the study of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

993
00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:36.550
<v Speaker 1>now and in being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are variety of aspects and so one </v>

994
00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:38.300
<v Speaker 1>aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never remember the names of these,</v>

995
00:57:38.301 --> 00:57:41.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get it here right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

996
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger broke the world of experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>being into three basic categories.</v>

997
00:57:47.601 --> 00:57:52.601
<v Speaker 1>There was the [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is basically the world </v>

998
00:57:52.601 --> 00:57:56.321
<v Speaker 1>beyond culture and the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the midwest and that's the world</v>

999
00:57:57.351 --> 00:58:02.351
<v Speaker 1>that we share with everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's roughly the social world and </v>

1000
00:58:02.351 --> 00:58:03.230
<v Speaker 1>the social structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the eigenvalue which is</v>

1001
00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:08.590
<v Speaker 1>that domain of experience that's unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you that other people can't partake </v>

1002
00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:12.881
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the elements of being as </v>

1003
00:58:12.881 --> 00:58:15.581
<v Speaker 1>far as the phenomenologists were </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned and in those domains of being </v>

1004
00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:21.080
<v Speaker 1>different experiences manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1005
00:58:21.081 --> 00:58:25.220
<v Speaker 1>We talked about some of the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be manifestations of the</v>

1006
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.110
<v Speaker 2>I can belt.</v>

1007
00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Scientists would call those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional or motivational states.</v>

1008
00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Normally people think of them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>

1009
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I would say I feel that's I feel such </v>
<v Speaker 1>and such,</v>

1010
00:58:40.221 --> 00:58:45.221
<v Speaker 1>and those are experiences that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that manifest themselves to you or that </v>

1011
00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:49.190
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you look at it that are</v>

1012
00:58:49.191 --> 00:58:53.930
<v Speaker 1>indicative of the manner in which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should act in relationship to being.</v>

1013
00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of,</v>

1014
00:58:57.590 --> 00:59:02.590
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason that this is relevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>to psychotherapy in particular was </v>

1015
00:59:02.590 --> 00:59:03.050
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1016
00:59:03.051 --> 00:59:08.051
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists were very </v>

1017
00:59:08.051 --> 00:59:08.051
<v Speaker 1>interested in the manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

1018
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:10.520
<v Speaker 1>So you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1019
00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:16.330
<v Speaker 1>nihilism is the absence of meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism is the fixed edness of </v>

1020
00:59:16.521 --> 00:59:17.270
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1021
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:22.630
<v Speaker 1>If you're a totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is say all exist in </v>

1022
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:26.861
<v Speaker 1>relationship to this structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if from the </v>

1023
00:59:26.861 --> 00:59:27.890
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists would say you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reduce the,</v>

1024
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.340
<v Speaker 1>the weld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the natural world,</v>

1025
00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.340
<v Speaker 1>the Mip dwelled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the social world.</v>

1026
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:36.410
<v Speaker 1>And the Eigen belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is your own world,</v>

1027
00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:41.411
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to reduce all of that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the well so that everything falls under </v>

1028
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.140
<v Speaker 1>an explanation that's granted to you by </v>
<v Speaker 1>some higher authority.</v>

1029
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the nihilists art are</v>
<v Speaker 1>having none of that.</v>

1030
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.140
<v Speaker 1>They see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1031
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.190
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use their eigen felt,</v>

1032
00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I would say their own world to </v>
<v Speaker 1>invalidate meaning in any domain.</v>

1033
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Now the phenomenologists would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1034
01:00:02.691 --> 01:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a mistake to use your rationality </v>
<v Speaker 1>to undermine the,</v>

1035
01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manifestation of meaning.</v>

1036
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:15.430
<v Speaker 1>And I can give you an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're a good nihilist and </v>

1037
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you think that maybe you're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>do something difficult,</v>

1038
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:23.530
<v Speaker 1>like put yourself through university and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you think in a relatively depressed</v>

1039
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>state of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you encountered some obstacles of </v>

1040
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>one form or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

1041
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:29.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hell with this.</v>

1042
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what difference does it make anyways?</v>

1043
01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Who cares if I go and get my degree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1044
01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>none of this knowledge is particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant or meaningful,</v>

1045
01:00:37.431 --> 01:00:40.070
<v Speaker 1>and who the hell is going to know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in a million years?</v>

1046
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:41.840
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1047
01:00:41.841 --> 01:00:44.420
<v Speaker 1>that's a perfectly rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1048
01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:49.190
<v Speaker 1>dismissal because who is going to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a million years or let's say,</v>

1049
01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:54.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you could make a case that </v>

1050
01:00:54.191 --> 01:00:54.890
<v Speaker 1>someone might know there might be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects left of you in a million years,</v>

1051
01:00:54.891 --> 01:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>then we'll just multiply it by 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go to a trillion years.</v>

1052
01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:04.271
<v Speaker 1>So here you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're this little tiny speck on a </v>

1053
01:01:04.271 --> 01:01:06.791
<v Speaker 1>slightly bigger speck in the middle of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy that has god only knows how many </v>

1054
01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:12.221
<v Speaker 1>billion stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a billion of those </v>

1055
01:01:12.221 --> 01:01:14.651
<v Speaker 1>galaxies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although there's way more than that and </v>

1056
01:01:14.651 --> 01:01:15.080
<v Speaker 1>they're spread across this tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanse of time.</v>

1057
01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>And in the face of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares what you do?</v>

1058
01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a phenomenologist would say is,</v>

1059
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:27.041
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at how meaning manifests </v>

1060
01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:32.260
<v Speaker 1>itself when you alter your own</v>

1061
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>private world in a variety of manners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're trying to do </v>

1062
01:01:41.051 --> 01:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're working in a,</v>

1063
01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're working as a volunteer in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital helping sick kids.</v>

1064
01:01:46.721 --> 01:01:51.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're reading to them so that they're </v>

1065
01:01:51.721 --> 01:01:51.721
<v Speaker 1>distracted from their pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

1066
01:01:51.721 --> 01:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when their trillion years,</v>

1067
01:01:52.571 --> 01:01:54.460
<v Speaker 1>who's going to know the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>

1068
01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's meaningless to do this.</v>

1069
01:01:56.770 --> 01:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>The phenomenologists would say if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame of reference that you're using,</v>

1070
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.580
<v Speaker 1>like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're imposing,</v>

1071
01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>if you're transforming the way you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>being manifests itself so that it </v>

1072
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>becomes meaningless and observed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should try experiencing it in a</v>

1073
01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:19.330
<v Speaker 1>different manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's d,</v>

1074
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:24.380
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a rationalist in some sense the </v>

1075
01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>phenomenology say a rationalist can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with the argument.</v>

1076
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>What difference is it going to make an a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion years and here you are,</v>

1077
01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:30.500
<v Speaker 1>a little dust speck among all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other despots.</v>

1078
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:35.630
<v Speaker 1>It's ultimately meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A phenomenologist would say maximize the</v>

1079
01:02:37.511 --> 01:02:39.820
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

1080
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the marker of truth and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a completely different way of </v>

1081
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.880
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he would say,</v>

1082
01:02:45.881 --> 01:02:50.881
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you're going to a hospital and </v>

1083
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:54.091
<v Speaker 1>you're reading to sick children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the frame of reference that you </v>

1084
01:02:54.091 --> 01:02:58.201
<v Speaker 1>should use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that you allow that experience </v>

1085
01:02:58.201 --> 01:03:01.501
<v Speaker 1>to manifest itself should be such that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience manifests itself so that </v>

1086
01:03:02.471 --> 01:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>it's as meaningful as possible rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than is meaning less.</v>

1087
01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>The idea being that just because you can</v>

1088
01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:17.400
<v Speaker 1>twist your own experience so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain elements of your being become </v>

1089
01:03:19.211 --> 01:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>meaningless does not mean that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1090
01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:27.930
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it becomes meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually means that it's wrong because </v>

1091
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:32.611
<v Speaker 1>you think you see it all depends on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you allow to be primary,</v>

1092
01:03:33.371 --> 01:03:38.371
<v Speaker 1>and this is the phenomenologists point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you allow your strict rationality to </v>

1093
01:03:38.371 --> 01:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>be primary than if it can attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and destroy it,</v>

1094
01:03:41.681 --> 01:03:45.080
<v Speaker 1>then that thing is worthy of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked and destroyed.</v>

1095
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>But if you flip it around and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1096
01:03:47.381 --> 01:03:52.381
<v Speaker 1>what you should be doing is allowing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacting with your experience or </v>

1097
01:03:53.261 --> 01:03:58.261
<v Speaker 1>allowing your experience to manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in a manner that situates you </v>

1098
01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:03.510
<v Speaker 1>most meaningfully in the here and now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever framework you're using to do </v>

1099
01:04:04.721 --> 01:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works is right.</v>

1100
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>That's a completely different way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things and it's a real.</v>

1101
01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a real escape from the pathology of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalism.</v>

1102
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:19.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't obvious that what you </v>

1103
01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.311
<v Speaker 1>think should take priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the phenomenologists would go </v>

1104
01:04:23.311 --> 01:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>farther than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would say that,</v>

1105
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>and this is something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's a way of thinking about it.</v>

1106
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So bins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wanger Sad.</v>

1107
01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.840
<v Speaker 1>What we perceive our first and foremost </v>
<v Speaker 1>bins.</v>

1108
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Wanger was a psychiatrist who is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much influenced in sweating your boss,</v>

1109
01:04:45.731 --> 01:04:50.731
<v Speaker 1>where the people going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly were very much influenced by </v>

1110
01:04:50.731 --> 01:04:53.471
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger area and ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say what we perceive our first and </v>

1111
01:04:53.471 --> 01:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not impressions of taste,</v>

1112
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:58.420
<v Speaker 1>smell or touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even things or objects,</v>

1113
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.330
<v Speaker 1>but meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1114
01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:06.331
<v Speaker 1>so the idea for the phenomenologists is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what being is made out of is </v>

1115
01:05:06.331 --> 01:05:10.441
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that the objective world is </v>

1116
01:05:10.441 --> 01:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>made out of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that being is made out of meaning.</v>

1117
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those meetings can be positive </v>

1118
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>and some of them can be negative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them can be neutral,</v>

1119
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:21.480
<v Speaker 1>but the constituent elements of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental constituent element of </v>

1120
01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:26.041
<v Speaker 1>being his meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there is an argument between </v>

1121
01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:28.450
<v Speaker 1>been swagger in Boston about how that </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning manifest itself,</v>

1122
01:05:28.451 --> 01:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>so been swaying or would say that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>endow meaning on the world,</v>

1123
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:37.710
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of a Nietzschean idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you create your own values so that </v>

1124
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:41.671
<v Speaker 1>you have within you something he called </v>
<v Speaker 1>an a priori ontological structure,</v>

1125
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:47.100
<v Speaker 1>so world designed or a matrix of meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>that determines how the world manifests </v>

1126
01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>itself to you.</v>

1127
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Now the easiest way to think about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you know you're thrown into a </v>

1128
01:05:52.331 --> 01:05:55.390
<v Speaker 1>particular time and place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another existentialist idea,</v>

1129
01:05:55.391 --> 01:05:57.760
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the absurdity of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1130
01:05:57.761 --> 01:06:02.761
<v Speaker 1>is that you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in this particular context and </v>

1131
01:06:02.761 --> 01:06:06.511
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something you have to contend with </v>

1132
01:06:06.511 --> 01:06:09.210
<v Speaker 1>and that's true for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're arbitrary preconditions to </v>

1133
01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.200
<v Speaker 1>everyone's being and one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary preconditions is the structure</v>

1134
01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:16.120
<v Speaker 1>through which you look at the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that structure enables some things to be</v>

1135
01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:18.280
<v Speaker 1>highlighted in some things to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored,</v>

1136
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.110
<v Speaker 1>and so the way that meaning manifests </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself is a reflection of this,</v>

1137
01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:28.330
<v Speaker 1>a priori ontological structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mode of being so there can't be </v>

1138
01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:33.370
<v Speaker 1>being which is say your experience for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sake of our argument,</v>

1139
01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.900
<v Speaker 1>without the structure that consists of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1140
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:41.560
<v Speaker 1>that that you consist up and so that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>given and it's.</v>

1141
01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:45.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the action of that structure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>determines the meaning of things.</v>

1142
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Now boss would say exactly the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would say that's the wrong way of </v>

1143
01:06:51.131 --> 01:06:56.131
<v Speaker 1>looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should look at the totality of your </v>

1144
01:06:56.131 --> 01:06:58.900
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is partly the broad natural world,</v>

1145
01:06:58.901 --> 01:07:00.820
<v Speaker 1>the cultural world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your own world,</v>

1146
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:05.950
<v Speaker 1>and you should note that meaning arises </v>
<v Speaker 1>in different places of its own accord.</v>

1147
01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:09.810
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't reduce it to the action,</v>

1148
01:07:09.811 --> 01:07:13.150
<v Speaker 1>say of this ontological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a priority ontological structure,</v>

1149
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:17.020
<v Speaker 1>and so one example would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1150
01:07:17.021 --> 01:07:19.630
<v Speaker 1>what about the meaning of things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand?</v>

1151
01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to understand how the meaning </v>

1152
01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.800
<v Speaker 1>of things you don't understand can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>attributed to what you understand.</v>

1153
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:29.560
<v Speaker 1>The meaning seems to be there to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

1154
01:07:29.561 --> 01:07:31.750
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

1155
01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:34.570
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a relationship with someone and</v>

1156
01:07:34.571 --> 01:07:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you discover that they have an affair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1157
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:41.110
<v Speaker 1>the discovery of the affair is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be something that's meaningful.</v>

1158
01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't know what the meaning is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to interpret it to begin </v>

1159
01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:49.321
<v Speaker 1>with likely very negatively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except to the degree that part of you </v>

1160
01:07:49.321 --> 01:07:50.440
<v Speaker 1>would like to escape out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

1161
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes if you're betrayed,</v>

1162
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:55.990
<v Speaker 1>you're happy about it because it's time </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that to be overweight,</v>

1163
01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:01.020
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are things that you can encounter </v>

1164
01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:04.711
<v Speaker 1>that you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are meaningful in and of </v>

1165
01:08:04.711 --> 01:08:07.050
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that you actually can't </v>

1166
01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:11.281
<v Speaker 1>separate your structure from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of everything.</v>

1167
01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 1>They're always interacting and meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges out of the interplay of those.</v>

1168
01:08:16.191 --> 01:08:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So here's another way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1169
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:22.220
<v Speaker 1>You're reading a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book is meaningful.</v>

1170
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Where is the meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it in your head?</v>

1171
01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Is it in the book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it's very difficult to say,</v>

1172
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:35.801
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously there's a subjective </v>

1173
01:08:35.801 --> 01:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an element that's unique to you,</v>

1174
01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:41.290
<v Speaker 1>but just as obviously that meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't manifest itself if it wasn't </v>

1175
01:08:42.021 --> 01:08:47.021
<v Speaker 1>for the book and of course the book </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be meaningful if you end the </v>

1176
01:08:47.021 --> 01:08:50.471
<v Speaker 1>book weren't embedded in this complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and so the meaning is an </v>

1177
01:08:50.471 --> 01:08:50.870
<v Speaker 1>emergent property.</v>

1178
01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 1>The meeting is an emergent property of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the interplay of all of the elements of </v>

1179
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:59.420
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting way of looking</v>

1180
01:08:59.421 --> 01:09:02.450
<v Speaker 1>at things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have all these elements of PA and</v>

1181
01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.420
<v Speaker 1>their dance produces meaning of one form</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>

1182
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say if you were a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologist that some of that </v>

1183
01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.781
<v Speaker 1>meaning is going to be life sustaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of it is going to be life </v>

1184
01:09:13.781 --> 01:09:17.771
<v Speaker 1>destroying and the phenomenologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say from a clinical perspective </v>

1185
01:09:17.771 --> 01:09:19.880
<v Speaker 1>that your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your.</v>

1186
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 1>If you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you exist in a system of meaning,</v>

1187
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:27.770
<v Speaker 1>revelations that are life destroying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should turn your attention away</v>

1188
01:09:27.771 --> 01:09:30.770
<v Speaker 1>from them towards meetings that are life</v>
<v Speaker 1>affirming.</v>

1189
01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's quite </v>

1190
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.891
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the phenomenal logical</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is that you can experiment </v>

1191
01:09:38.891 --> 01:09:39.740
<v Speaker 1>with it quite easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could say to you,</v>

1192
01:09:39.741 --> 01:09:44.741
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of phenomenological </v>

1193
01:09:44.741 --> 01:09:46.310
<v Speaker 1>experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one would be for the next two weeks,</v>

1194
01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:52.310
<v Speaker 1>you want to detach yourself in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense so that you're a curious observer </v>

1195
01:09:53.151 --> 01:09:54.110
<v Speaker 1>of your being.</v>

1196
01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.990
<v Speaker 1>You're not necessarily trying to direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1197
01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.540
<v Speaker 1>you know you're just trying to let it </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfold.</v>

1198
01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:04.900
<v Speaker 1>And then what you might want to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>for is when the meaning that manifests </v>

1199
01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:10.451
<v Speaker 1>itself as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as things flow around you is clearly </v>

1200
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.580
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the life affirming type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you'll see that,</v>

1201
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:21.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how well situated you are </v>

1202
01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 1>in some sense because if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're surrounded by,</v>

1203
01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.920
<v Speaker 1>if your experiential field is primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative,</v>

1204
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:30.200
<v Speaker 1>these are going to be relatively rare </v>
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>

1205
01:10:30.201 --> 01:10:34.250
<v Speaker 1>but they will still not be nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might only happen for a few seconds</v>

1206
01:10:34.251 --> 01:10:36.440
<v Speaker 1>or a few minutes every day or every few </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1207
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 1>But so say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1208
01:10:37.761 --> 01:10:42.761
<v Speaker 1>you notice that all of a sudden you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a place where things are the way you </v>

1209
01:10:42.761 --> 01:10:44.300
<v Speaker 1>would like them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could say you're in a place where</v>

1210
01:10:44.301 --> 01:10:47.660
<v Speaker 1>being is manifesting itself as </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>

1211
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a place where nihilism is not </v>

1212
01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:53.530
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>

1213
01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:56.210
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't apply because of the quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the experience is such that it's life</v>

1214
01:10:56.211 --> 01:11:01.211
<v Speaker 1>affirming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to notice that it's something </v>

1215
01:11:01.211 --> 01:11:01.370
<v Speaker 1>that happens and then you might ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

1216
01:11:01.371 --> 01:11:02.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1217
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>what are the preconditions that enabled </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1218
01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:12.340
<v Speaker 1>What are the preconditions that enabled </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the different sub elements of </v>

1219
01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:15.971
<v Speaker 1>being to work harmoniously together at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that time in place so that that was the </v>

1220
01:11:16.561 --> 01:11:21.561
<v Speaker 1>meaning that emerged and then the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>question might be how would it be </v>

1221
01:11:21.561 --> 01:11:25.500
<v Speaker 1>possible for me to allow that to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>more frequently?</v>

1222
01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:30.750
<v Speaker 1>And so you can tilt yourself towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>life affirming meetings in a way from,</v>

1223
01:11:31.710 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 1>from say meanings that are associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with disparate nihilism,</v>

1224
01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:40.551
<v Speaker 1>but you do that partly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you're navigating in a </v>

1225
01:11:40.551 --> 01:11:40.551
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1226
01:11:40.551 --> 01:11:44.691
<v Speaker 1>I think you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're navigating to find the </v>

1227
01:11:44.691 --> 01:11:46.110
<v Speaker 1>line between order and chaos because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the meaning is.</v>

1228
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:51.140
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly where the meaning is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can feel it like it's a place </v>

1229
01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.801
<v Speaker 1>and that's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phenomenologists are trying to get </v>

1230
01:11:54.801 --> 01:11:57.051
<v Speaker 1>across these things are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not secondary manifestations of </v>

1231
01:11:57.841 --> 01:12:00.870
<v Speaker 1>some deeper reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are reality itself.</v>

1232
01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll talk about this more when we </v>

1233
01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:06.230
<v Speaker 1>get to the neuropsychological portion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the course,</v>

1234
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:10.680
<v Speaker 1>that your brain is actually set up first</v>
<v Speaker 1>and foremost to detect meaning.</v>

1235
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:15.920
<v Speaker 1>You detect meaning before you detect </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects and it's partly because you.</v>

1236
01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:22.130
<v Speaker 1>You have to detect meetings so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to do when something happens </v>

1237
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:24.930
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly and there are times when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out what to do before</v>

1238
01:12:24.931 --> 01:12:27.000
<v Speaker 1>you have enough time to even see what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1239
01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:30.180
<v Speaker 1>You just don't have the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1240
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:31.260
<v Speaker 1>part of the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1241
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:34.150
<v Speaker 1>what exactly do you mean by meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1242
01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I think meaning is significance for </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior or significance for this </v>

1243
01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.160
<v Speaker 1>structure that governs behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are very,</v>

1244
01:12:41.161 --> 01:12:44.260
<v Speaker 1>very basic fundamental perceptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1245
01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:49.440
<v Speaker 1>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the object and then you derive </v>

1246
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:49.440
<v Speaker 1>the meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the opposite.</v>

1247
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.111
<v Speaker 1>Many cases you perceive the meaning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>derive the object and there's plenty of </v>

1248
01:12:54.211 --> 01:12:57.090
<v Speaker 1>neurophysiological evidence for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1249
01:12:57.091 --> 01:13:02.091
<v Speaker 1>you have lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your retina is a pattern </v>

1250
01:13:02.091 --> 01:13:05.481
<v Speaker 1>detector and the retinal information is </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted to your brain alone,</v>

1251
01:13:05.641 --> 01:13:07.350
<v Speaker 1>the optic nerve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the optic nerve,</v>

1252
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.350
<v Speaker 1>branches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it goes lots of places in your body.</v>

1253
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Some of it maps right onto your spinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cord so that your eyes can make your </v>

1254
01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:19.341
<v Speaker 1>body move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it maps onto your Amygdala so </v>

1255
01:13:19.341 --> 01:13:22.761
<v Speaker 1>that what you perceive are the meanings </v>
<v Speaker 1>of facial expressions without even </v>

1256
01:13:22.761 --> 01:13:26.271
<v Speaker 1>perceiving the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can have people who have </v>

1257
01:13:26.271 --> 01:13:26.271
<v Speaker 1>blindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a damaged visual cortex.</v>

1258
01:13:26.271 --> 01:13:30.030
<v Speaker 1>You can show them angry faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they say they can't see,</v>

1259
01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:35.210
<v Speaker 1>but they'll respond to them electro </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiologically it as if they're being </v>

1260
01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:39.141
<v Speaker 1>exposed to something negative and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the retinal pattern is </v>

1261
01:13:39.141 --> 01:13:40.980
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself right onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1262
01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:45.120
<v Speaker 1>That maps one form of meaning so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly have meaning without,</v>

1263
01:13:45.570 --> 01:13:50.570
<v Speaker 1>without object perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that you derive the </v>

1264
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:52.230
<v Speaker 1>meaning from the object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the thing and then you attribute</v>

1265
01:13:52.231 --> 01:13:53.750
<v Speaker 1>meaning to the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1266
01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.520
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some levels of analysis,</v>

1267
01:13:56.521 --> 01:13:59.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's wrong and many other levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis.</v>

1268
01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:04.670
<v Speaker 1>And so the other thing I think that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can try that's phenomenologically </v>

1269
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:09.220
<v Speaker 1>informed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is quite an interesting trick.</v>

1270
01:14:09.221 --> 01:14:10.700
<v Speaker 1>It can really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard on you.</v>

1271
01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Those be careful if you try this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one,</v>

1272
01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:17.440
<v Speaker 1>another thing you could try for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks is to watch what you say.</v>

1273
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:19.210
<v Speaker 1>You've got to detach yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1274
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:24.510
<v Speaker 1>you have to remove the belief that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and you are the same thing.</v>

1275
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:34.570
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to watch mostly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say and then you have to see.</v>

1276
01:14:35.951 --> 01:14:39.190
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that Rogers would </v>
<v Speaker 1>also be an advocate.</v>

1277
01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:44.640
<v Speaker 1>You have to see if what you say it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel what you have to see if what </v>

1278
01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you say improves the quality of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>being or makes it worse.</v>

1279
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:53.550
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start believing in what you say </v>

1280
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:54.370
<v Speaker 1>and watch what the consequences are </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>

1281
01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:58.570
<v Speaker 1>how it manifests itself in terms of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of being.</v>

1282
01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Then you can also learn how to only say </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that improve the quality of </v>

1283
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:04.330
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1284
01:15:04.331 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing if you can manage </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1285
01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:07.460
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1286
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:12.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrifying in some sense because </v>

1287
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:14.911
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you'll find is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that hardly anything that you say does </v>

1288
01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:18.541
<v Speaker 1>that most of it's neutral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a fair bit of it has exactly the </v>

1289
01:15:18.541 --> 01:15:20.620
<v Speaker 1>opposite consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes things worse.</v>

1290
01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:26.460
<v Speaker 1>So I think I mentioned that the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena,</v>

1291
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:30.100
<v Speaker 1>that's where the phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the term phenomenology comes from.</v>

1292
01:15:30.101 --> 01:15:35.101
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the term phenomena means is </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Greek word famous thigh and </v>

1293
01:15:35.411 --> 01:15:37.810
<v Speaker 1>famous diet means to shine forth.</v>

1294
01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:43.380
<v Speaker 1>And so the phenomenologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists argument is that like </v>

1295
01:15:43.841 --> 01:15:48.841
<v Speaker 1>being is made up of meanings that shine </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth for you and that those different </v>

1296
01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:50.020
<v Speaker 1>meanings attract you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1297
01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.390
<v Speaker 1>they're like guide posts that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow.</v>

1298
01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.920
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

1299
01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed this for example in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to reading,</v>

1300
01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:01.270
<v Speaker 1>so I'll be reading a complex tax and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some passage will really strike me.</v>

1301
01:16:01.271 --> 01:16:04.600
<v Speaker 1>So it manifests itself as meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

1302
01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1303
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:10.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the phenomenologists which would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be being been swagger,</v>

1304
01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:10.570
<v Speaker 1>we'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1305
01:16:10.571 --> 01:16:12.730
<v Speaker 1>it's because of the way that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>

1306
01:16:12.731 --> 01:16:14.020
<v Speaker 1>but boss would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1307
01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:17.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dance that's occurring within the</v>

1308
01:16:17.861 --> 01:16:21.610
<v Speaker 1>structure of everything and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that is the manifestation</v>

1309
01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:24.460
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of this meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1310
01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:28.330
<v Speaker 1>what I've found is that I can follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>threads of meaning through books.</v>

1311
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:31.300
<v Speaker 1>You know that it's something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>guiding me,</v>

1312
01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:32.350
<v Speaker 1>that sense of meaning.</v>

1313
01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:36.250
<v Speaker 1>And often if I find something within a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book that's meaningful,</v>

1314
01:16:36.251 --> 01:16:40.510
<v Speaker 1>then I'll read the other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person wrote and I'll see that some</v>

1315
01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:45.570
<v Speaker 1>of the people that they read have </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful things to say and then I can </v>

1316
01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:45.840
<v Speaker 1>branch out that network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's.</v>

1317
01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:51.220
<v Speaker 1>It's following a pathway that's laid out</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you in some sense that's laid out </v>

1318
01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.350
<v Speaker 1>for you in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1319
01:16:53.351 --> 01:16:56.680
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenal logical idea is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you follow that pathway,</v>

1320
01:16:56.681 --> 01:17:01.681
<v Speaker 1>then what happens is being becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more integrated around you.</v>

1321
01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:09.360
<v Speaker 1>And those experiences of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of intrinsic meaning start to multiply </v>

1322
01:17:10.551 --> 01:17:12.710
<v Speaker 1>and increase in intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1323
01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:15.980
<v Speaker 1>if you're able to do that over a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>

1324
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 1>then you can get more and more of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>totality of your being,</v>

1325
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:25.160
<v Speaker 1>revealing the kinds of meanings that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop you from being either nihilistic or</v>

1326
01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:27.710
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1327
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:28.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the basic.</v>

1328
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal logical psychotherapy.</v>

1329
01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might first say,</v>

1330
01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:35.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1331
01:17:35.481 --> 01:17:38.360
<v Speaker 1>you're depressed and anxious and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life isn't going very well.</v>

1332
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.110
<v Speaker 1>What keeps you afloat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1333
01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:43.850
<v Speaker 1>it's something to observe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we might say,</v>

1334
01:17:43.851 --> 01:17:48.851
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there ways that we can expand that </v>

1335
01:17:48.851 --> 01:17:53.711
<v Speaker 1>small area that's keeping you afloat so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it starts to occupied more and more</v>

1336
01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:59.021
<v Speaker 1>of your experience and push back the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts that are either neutral or </v>

1337
01:17:59.021 --> 01:17:59.960
<v Speaker 1>negative and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1338
01:17:59.961 --> 01:18:04.961
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in large part a consequence of </v>

1339
01:18:04.961 --> 01:18:08.860
<v Speaker 1>attention and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and willingness to first of all,</v>

1340
01:18:09.741 --> 01:18:11.990
<v Speaker 1>treat things as if they're meaning is </v>
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

1341
01:18:11.991 --> 01:18:16.991
<v Speaker 1>And then second to allow that reality to</v>
<v Speaker 1>transform the way that you experience </v>

1342
01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:23.561
<v Speaker 1>things in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you Thursday.</v>
