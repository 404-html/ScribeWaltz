1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.620
<v Speaker 1>So the next four lectures are also </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards discussion of primarily</v>

3
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>clinical theories of psychology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology.</v>

4
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about lines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that in some ways run parallel </v>

5
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.831
<v Speaker 1>to those analysts because the thinkers </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss now with a few </v>

6
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>small exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well all of them,</v>

7
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.870
<v Speaker 1>all of the thinkers we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss in the next four lectures were </v>

8
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.411
<v Speaker 1>either influenced heavily by Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human adler or were themselves thinkers </v>

9
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:56.001
<v Speaker 1>who influenced Freud and young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an intellectual continuity </v>

10
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 1>stretching over with with people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply educated and who are very </v>

11
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.721
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's intellectual continuity ideas </v>

12
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>stretching over exceptional spans of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and so it's exactly the sort of </v>

13
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:16.311
<v Speaker 1>thing that you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of relationship is exactly </v>

14
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>what you'd imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger has had a variety of influences,</v>

15
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:23.901
<v Speaker 1>so let's say Freud and Jung and Adler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was also very much influenced by </v>

16
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenological ideas and the </v>

17
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.941
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologists were and are phenomenal</v>
<v Speaker 1>of brand philosophy and which I'll </v>

18
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:42.711
<v Speaker 1>explain more deeply and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary domain of influence on Rogers </v>

19
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:47.691
<v Speaker 1>was Christianity likely and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity also via probably northern </v>

20
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>European culture as far as I can tell.</v>

21
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.390
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking specifically about </v>

22
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Christianity in relationship to rogers </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because as a young man,</v>

23
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>he was a fundamentalist Christian and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a seminarian.</v>

24
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:05.961
<v Speaker 1>So we had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was quite oriented towards mainline </v>

25
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Protestant Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he was in university,</v>

26
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>he had a crisis of belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

27
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>when he was even going to go to China as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a missionary at one point,</v>

28
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had a crisis of belief in </v>

29
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>university because he'd also been </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically trained.</v>

30
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:26.811
<v Speaker 1>His father was a farmer who used rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced farming techniques and so </v>

31
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>rogers was trained to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically from a very young age and</v>

32
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.930
<v Speaker 1>he experienced the conflict between his </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious belief and his scientific </v>

33
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.411
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions quite intensely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that battle is formal Christian </v>

34
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>belief was the loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

35
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>his thinking is very much influenced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist Protestant </v>

36
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.080
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions and</v>

37
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>the effect of those all described as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked through Roger's thinking.</v>

38
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to understand the </v>

39
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.831
<v Speaker 1>philosophical underpinnings of a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality or psychology theory because</v>

40
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.490
<v Speaker 1>every theory is set within a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions,</v>

41
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.970
<v Speaker 1>things that you have to assume to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>true in order to proceed with the </v>

42
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the axioms in,</v>

43
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.680
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>in classical geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't prove the axioms.</v>

45
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>You have to accept them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you accept the axioms,</v>

46
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 1>then you can move forward and use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole system.</v>

47
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason that systems have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have axioms which are elements of belief</v>

48
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>is because every system is incomplete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't cover the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense,</v>

50
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>you need a place to dispense with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance.</v>

51
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>And the way you do that is by making </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions.</v>

52
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:56.581
<v Speaker 1>We're going to act as if the following </v>
<v Speaker 1>is true and then you can proceed with a </v>

53
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>partial theory and you'll have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>success with it,</v>

54
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's useful to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions because they'd orientate</v>

55
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.440
<v Speaker 1>new properly towards the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers is a phenomenologist and </v>

56
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:15.901
<v Speaker 1>phenomenology is a brand of philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 1>which I believe started with Edmund </v>

57
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Husserl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was probably made most influential </v>

58
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>by his student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Heidegger.</v>

59
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Now heidegger</v>

60
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a philosopher,</v>

61
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:34.441
<v Speaker 1>I suppose somewhat like Nicha and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very much his thinking around,</v>

62
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 1>very much counter to what you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe as general academic philosophy.</v>

63
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger believe that ever since the </v>

64
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.021
<v Speaker 1>time of Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is when people think philosophy </v>

65
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less western philosophy,</v>

66
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:56.071
<v Speaker 1>had taken up an erroneous direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had become too concerned with the </v>

67
00:04:56.471 --> 00:05:01.471
<v Speaker 1>nature of structures of thought and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned enough about the nature of </v>

68
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.350
<v Speaker 1>being and so you can determine those two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things being as how things are and </v>

69
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>thought of course is how you represent </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

70
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.970
<v Speaker 1>and one of heidegger's missions was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reestablish being as the central reality</v>

71
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>of philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

72
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.870
<v Speaker 1>that begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what is being well to </v>

73
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:36.061
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize reality as being is not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it the same way that you </v>

74
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize it</v>

75
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.500
<v Speaker 1>in terms of modern Western thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the presuppositions at </v>

76
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:52.801
<v Speaker 1>the basis of modern Western thought is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the most intelligent way to divide </v>

77
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:59.101
<v Speaker 1>up the world is in terms of and </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective experience or subjective and </v>

78
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>subjective experience and object of </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

79
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.320
<v Speaker 1>So the fundamental scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition you might say is that </v>

80
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 1>there is an objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the real thing.</v>

81
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>You come to that by performing certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures,</v>

82
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>documenting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing now of those procedures,</v>

83
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>documenting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then allowing other people to do the</v>

84
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:27.581
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating under the presupposition that </v>

85
00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>if they experience the same outcome from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the procedures,</v>

86
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>then what they're experiencing is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the scientific method,</v>

87
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Method results,</v>

88
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.550
<v Speaker 1>your detailed the method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how you act on the world.</v>

89
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:42.551
<v Speaker 1>You get the results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you compare them maybe across multiple </v>

90
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:45.941
<v Speaker 1>observations that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then other people do multiple </v>

91
00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>observations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come up with that with a consensus,</v>

92
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's a method bound consensus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course you abstract out general </v>

93
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 1>principles from that works very </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerfully,</v>

94
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:55.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake about it.</v>

95
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.670
<v Speaker 1>The objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there is an objective </v>

96
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.030
<v Speaker 1>external world and that that's the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>way to conceptualize reality is an </v>

97
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably powerful tool.</v>

98
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's an accurate </v>

99
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.361
<v Speaker 1>description of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a much more difficult question </v>

100
00:07:14.361 --> 00:07:16.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly a matter of definition </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

101
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the case that there are different </v>

102
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.430
<v Speaker 1>forms of geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might know this,</v>

103
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.451
<v Speaker 1>you can start from the presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>that reality has a three dimensional </v>

104
00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:31.060
<v Speaker 1>structure and then you're basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the realm of Euclidean geometry,</v>

105
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 1>but you can also start with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that reality has afforded</v>

106
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:39.551
<v Speaker 1>emotional structure and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry was invented in the late 18 </v>

107
00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:43.681
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and it turned out to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect geometry to describe the </v>

108
00:07:43.681 --> 00:07:46.531
<v Speaker 1>universe that Einstein conceptualized </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he came up with his great theories </v>

109
00:07:46.531 --> 00:07:50.671
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the second decade of the 20th </v>

110
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:53.971
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting because you could </v>

111
00:07:53.971 --> 00:07:56.371
<v Speaker 1>start from different assumptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build tools on the basis of those </v>

112
00:07:56.371 --> 00:08:00.241
<v Speaker 1>assumptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you find out that those </v>

113
00:08:00.241 --> 00:08:00.241
<v Speaker 1>tools work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

114
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not that easy to think of flaws</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the subjective experience.</v>

115
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world conceptualization,</v>

116
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.440
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as for us as modern people,</v>

117
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:20.010
<v Speaker 1>it forms the basis of so much of what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that we just think about it as </v>

118
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.100
<v Speaker 1>axiomatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just true.</v>

119
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.220
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bear any question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to offer you a couple of </v>

120
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.500
<v Speaker 1>examples of why it might bear some </v>
<v Speaker 1>questioning and you can,</v>

121
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.270
<v Speaker 1>you can think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it.</v>

122
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>The first problem is that that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical scientific view of the world </v>

123
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.200
<v Speaker 1>has a very difficult time accounting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>

124
00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:43.510
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are called quality,</v>

125
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often by people who are interested in </v>

126
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.731
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So knowing the wave length of light </v>

127
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:53.080
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to tell you much about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective experience of color.</v>

128
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:54.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

129
00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>we experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

130
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>in a non continuous fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

131
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Because we see discreet colors like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd see in a rainbolt.</v>

132
00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean they shade into each other to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>

133
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like they go from light </v>
<v Speaker 1>red,</v>

134
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>dark red in the continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's clear demarcations of color.</v>

135
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 1>While that's because of the way your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is wired,</v>

136
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like over the course of </v>

137
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.151
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've learned is that parsing up </v>

138
00:09:20.151 --> 00:09:23.091
<v Speaker 1>that wavelength fragment in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories which would be the different </v>

139
00:09:23.091 --> 00:09:24.930
<v Speaker 1>colors that we see has substantial </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical utility.</v>

140
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Now what are the things you might ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

141
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do those colors exist?</v>

142
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectively,</v>

143
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.740
<v Speaker 1>they don't seem to exist as colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because of the wavelengths that </v>

144
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 1>we see are actually continuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when one color shades into another,</v>

145
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>there's no radical transformation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wave lake length.</v>

146
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we see it categorically.</v>

147
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is that real or not?</v>

148
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Or The colors we see real or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

149
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.640
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

150
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>you can't get a collective experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

151
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 1>like you can get a collective experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the blackboard,</v>

152
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but pain seems to be something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>limited to subjective perception,</v>

153
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one acts as if pain isn't real.</v>

154
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that of all the things that </v>

155
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.161
<v Speaker 1>you might consider real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we act as if pain is the most real </v>

156
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:23.541
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You certainly can't argue yourself out </v>

157
00:10:23.541 --> 00:10:23.541
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

158
00:10:23.541 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a fundamental element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

159
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's two places.</v>

160
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.030
<v Speaker 1>We also have no account in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective objective.</v>

161
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.770
<v Speaker 1>What breakup?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bifurcation of the world.</v>

162
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.470
<v Speaker 1>We have no explanation whatsoever for </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

163
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.840
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

164
00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:45.841
<v Speaker 1>because you could make a case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no being without consciousness.</v>

165
00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Like is there something if there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one there to receive it,</v>

166
00:10:49.571 --> 00:10:54.571
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not the same question as if a </v>

167
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:54.571
<v Speaker 1>tree falls in the forest and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one there to hear.</v>

168
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:56.590
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make it sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same question.</v>

169
00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:01.000
<v Speaker 1>It sounds superficially the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a much more complex question</v>

170
00:11:01.001 --> 00:11:02.440
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

171
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.630
<v Speaker 1>if we don't know the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between time and consciousness,</v>

172
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.540
<v Speaker 1>like we have a certain perception of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

173
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.960
<v Speaker 1>We have a certain temporal realm within </v>
<v Speaker 1>which we exist.</v>

174
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Our refresh rate for our vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

175
00:11:16.451 --> 00:11:21.451
<v Speaker 1>is about 60 hertz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you can see computer </v>

176
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:22.150
<v Speaker 1>screens flicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they have a reflex rate that's slower</v>

177
00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:26.410
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 60 hertz to us looks continuous,</v>

178
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:31.411
<v Speaker 1>but you know there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>microseconds in a second and for a </v>

179
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:35.041
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a fast process it computer </v>

180
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:35.041
<v Speaker 1>that can do maybe a trillion operations </v>
<v Speaker 1>per second.</v>

181
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.140
<v Speaker 1>If it was watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

182
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:43.350
<v Speaker 1>a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just see a picture still </v>

183
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.621
<v Speaker 1>picture that was there forever and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>another still picture that was there </v>

184
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:48.370
<v Speaker 1>forever and like it wouldn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impression of continuous movement.</v>

185
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.070
<v Speaker 1>So there's this weird subjective element</v>
<v Speaker 1>to time.</v>

186
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.090
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then here's more,</v>

187
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.950
<v Speaker 1>here's a more complex criticism of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject object idea.</v>

188
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I thought about this for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the best example I know of it is I </v>

189
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.900
<v Speaker 1>read this book a while back written by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kgb officer and it was published after </v>

190
00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:12.540
<v Speaker 1>the fall of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:16.490
<v Speaker 1>the wall and the Soviet Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this KGB officer claimed that he had</v>

192
00:12:16.491 --> 00:12:19.670
<v Speaker 1>worked in a biological warfare unit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union.</v>

193
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:25.150
<v Speaker 1>And the purpose of the biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare unit was to turn infectious </v>

194
00:12:25.281 --> 00:12:29.540
<v Speaker 1>diseases into aerosols so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be sprayed on enemy populations,</v>

195
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.050
<v Speaker 1>and so they were working on two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing a very,</v>

196
00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:34.820
<v Speaker 1>very silent infection.</v>

197
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.820
<v Speaker 1>And so if your infection is one that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very severe but also very transmissible </v>

198
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.500
<v Speaker 1>because those things are separate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then also one that could survive being </v>

199
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.920
<v Speaker 1>aerosolized because it turns out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's quite difficult,</v>

200
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.690
<v Speaker 1>which we should all be very thankful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

201
00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.010
<v Speaker 1>And one of the projects they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on was a,</v>

202
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.450
<v Speaker 1>an attempt to cross Ebola was smallpox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Ebola is,</v>

203
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.300
<v Speaker 1>you all know about Ebola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume it's a.</v>

204
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.310
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fatal,</v>

205
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.970
<v Speaker 1>although they've learned ways to treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>it now and maybe have a vaccine,</v>

206
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:10.150
<v Speaker 1>but at that time it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fatal and a smallpox is incredibly </v>

207
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.041
<v Speaker 1>contagious and so they were hoping they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could develop something that it was </v>

208
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:15.290
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very contagious and very,</v>

209
00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:20.291
<v Speaker 1>very deadly that you could spray on </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilian populations.</v>

210
00:13:20.361 --> 00:13:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Now you know here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's where it gets tricky.</v>

211
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.760
<v Speaker 1>It gets tricky here because how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>answered this question inevitably,</v>

212
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.070
<v Speaker 1>inevitably depends on how you define </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

213
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 1>And truth is actually something you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to define before you can have a </v>

214
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.301
<v Speaker 1>conversation about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a kind of a strange thing </v>

215
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a case that determining how</v>

216
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 1>to cross Ebola with smallpox and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aerosolized.</v>

217
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:56.930
<v Speaker 1>It is a perfectly valid scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>question</v>

218
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:05.190
<v Speaker 1>and because science is value free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to make an argument </v>

219
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.221
<v Speaker 1>that that's any worse experiment than </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other kind of experiment or any </v>

220
00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:11.911
<v Speaker 1>other kind of investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could also imagine even that if </v>

221
00:14:11.911 --> 00:14:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you didn't go to the aerosolization </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>

222
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 1>that positive things might come out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

223
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:19.801
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'd end up with a more detailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of DNA or something as a </v>

224
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the investigation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have positive consequences.</v>

225
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.750
<v Speaker 1>But it still seems that the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing scientific research across </v>

226
00:14:31.431 --> 00:14:32.840
<v Speaker 1>crossing Ebola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smallpox,</v>

227
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:38.050
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be something wrong about </v>

228
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.081
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's maybe that sense of wrongness </v>

229
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.950
<v Speaker 1>as well that can't be captured with </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside inside scientific models.</v>

230
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:50.550
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>claimed in and Rogers and the is that in</v>

231
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:57.761
<v Speaker 1>some sense is that the scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality has to be encapsulated within a </v>

232
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.490
<v Speaker 1>unethical reality rather than the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way around.</v>

233
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that feeling you have when you </v>

234
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:08.930
<v Speaker 1>hear about someone crossing Ebola with </v>
<v Speaker 1>smallpox,</v>

235
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 1>that feeling you have in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real thing.</v>

236
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 1>That feeling and that that's part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being</v>

237
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.150
<v Speaker 2>now</v>

238
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.550
<v Speaker 1>for the phenomenologists being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually complicated to define and it's </v>

239
00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:30.500
<v Speaker 1>hard to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the phenomenologists do,</v>

240
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:32.270
<v Speaker 1>we start with a different set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions.</v>

241
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.780
<v Speaker 1>They don't assume that the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach reality is to break it up into </v>

242
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.251
<v Speaker 1>this objective and the object it presume</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead that the way that you should </v>

243
00:15:42.251 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 1>approach reality is by assuming that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your experiences real all of it.</v>

244
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean there aren't different</v>

245
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:50.740
<v Speaker 1>categories of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:55.750
<v Speaker 1>because you could still say a dream and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experience you have walked dreaming </v>

247
00:15:56.841 --> 00:16:01.841
<v Speaker 1>of walking down the street and walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the street are still different </v>

248
00:16:01.841 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the phenomenologists would say,</v>

249
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:07.961
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can keep your categorical </v>

250
00:16:07.961 --> 00:16:10.360
<v Speaker 1>distinctions in tact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to say that they're both </v>

251
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:10.360
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

252
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

253
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.270
<v Speaker 1>this is an assumption and I told you </v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

254
00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:17.390
<v Speaker 1>The assumptions generating part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason the assumption is generated.</v>

255
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.940
<v Speaker 1>The alternative assumption is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are problems that emerged with the</v>

256
00:16:21.941 --> 00:16:25.790
<v Speaker 1>set of assumptions that make up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific worldview.</v>

257
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:30.791
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that surprising that the </v>

258
00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:32.711
<v Speaker 1>scientific worldview can't encompass the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective because the scientific world </v>

259
00:16:32.711 --> 00:16:37.251
<v Speaker 1>view was actually established by by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bacon and descartes safe and by well,</v>

260
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.980
<v Speaker 1>by other thinkers of that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was set up to exclude the subjective </v>

261
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.990
<v Speaker 1>from the conceptualization of objective </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

262
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 1>So you can't really criticize science </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he does that,</v>

263
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:55.721
<v Speaker 1>but you can say the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective is excluded is a fault or at </v>

264
00:16:56.631 --> 00:17:01.631
<v Speaker 1>least an incompleteness and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>incompleteness sometimes has </v>

265
00:17:01.631 --> 00:17:05.930
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary extraordinarily serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences that you can't just dismiss</v>

266
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.730
<v Speaker 1>because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

267
00:17:07.731 --> 00:17:12.731
<v Speaker 1>have the Russians being the Soviets </v>
<v Speaker 1>being successful in crossing Ebola with </v>

268
00:17:13.431 --> 00:17:18.431
<v Speaker 1>smallpox and aerosolizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we might all be dead and then he </v>

269
00:17:18.431 --> 00:17:22.631
<v Speaker 1>might think that any theory that leads </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone to be dead might reasonably be </v>

270
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 1>criticized for its assumption to </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal truth.</v>

271
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Now you can debate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but and,</v>

272
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.030
<v Speaker 1>and rightly so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all I'm pointing out,</v>

273
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 1>is there a reasons to go at this from </v>
<v Speaker 1>another approach?</v>

274
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Roger's basic assumption that you</v>

275
00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:51.331
<v Speaker 1>were more likely to be properly oriented</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life if you adopted a phenomenal,</v>

276
00:17:51.491 --> 00:17:56.491
<v Speaker 1>logical approach to your experience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to break up reality in that manner.</v>

277
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:03.950
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

278
00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:09.910
<v Speaker 1>when my daughter was about three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she have nightmare and she came running </v>

279
00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:09.910
<v Speaker 1>into</v>

280
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.560
<v Speaker 1>her parent's bedroom and she told me her</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream and she was all upset by it.</v>

281
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.740
<v Speaker 1>She might've even been younger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

282
00:18:21.741 --> 00:18:26.741
<v Speaker 1>At that point had she had dreamed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a clear stream and that it was</v>

283
00:18:28.251 --> 00:18:31.970
<v Speaker 1>quite beautiful and that there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage littering the bottom of it.</v>

284
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that time,</v>

285
00:18:33.621 --> 00:18:34.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

286
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.220
<v Speaker 1>kids are quite sophisticated in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to categorize.</v>

287
00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:42.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that time she'd already learned the </v>

288
00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:42.221
<v Speaker 1>difference between a kid things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult things.</v>

289
00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And you think that's a bloody complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of discrimination,</v>

290
00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:50.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like what objective features do </v>

291
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.970
<v Speaker 1>adult things share in common that </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiates them from things you,</v>

292
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
<v Speaker 1>you can't actually come up with a set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective criteria that allows that </v>

293
00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.390
<v Speaker 1>distinction to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But kids by the time they're three years</v>

294
00:18:59.391 --> 00:19:04.391
<v Speaker 1>got a pretty clear grasp of that so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can come up with very sophisticated </v>

295
00:19:04.391 --> 00:19:04.430
<v Speaker 1>classifications.</v>

296
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm about the same time and one of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends had a two year old who went </v>

297
00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:15.251
<v Speaker 1>outside their house one day and looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the street and there were a couple </v>

298
00:19:15.251 --> 00:19:15.470
<v Speaker 1>of garbage cans knocked over and the kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

299
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

300
00:19:17.091 --> 00:19:19.520
<v Speaker 1>that's also extremely sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you think,</v>

301
00:19:19.521 --> 00:19:24.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole street is a very complex </v>

302
00:19:24.521 --> 00:19:27.671
<v Speaker 1>visual set of visual stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to be able to glance at that and </v>

303
00:19:27.671 --> 00:19:31.811
<v Speaker 1>then to know that something is out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and then to make an otter and </v>

304
00:19:31.811 --> 00:19:35.461
<v Speaker 1>solid to draw people's attention to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a ridiculously sophisticated </v>

305
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:38.270
<v Speaker 1>cognitive out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my daughter was doing the same thing</v>

306
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.140
<v Speaker 1>within the context of her dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was upset about this.</v>

307
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Now it's quite interesting because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

308
00:19:44.151 --> 00:19:49.151
<v Speaker 1>well why would someone who was three the</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset about the fact that a stream </v>

309
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.060
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear stream was with had garbage in it,</v>

310
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

311
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like innate environmentalism or </v>

312
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.680
<v Speaker 1>something like that and a concern for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment and that could easily be</v>

313
00:20:00.681 --> 00:20:01.700
<v Speaker 1>the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

314
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:08.410
<v Speaker 1>If we found our environment up </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually during our evolutionary </v>

315
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.101
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was likely to have very negative </v>

316
00:20:12.101 --> 00:20:12.101
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even birds cleaned their own nest and so</v>

317
00:20:12.101 --> 00:20:13.700
<v Speaker 1>the fees and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they keep their hives,</v>

318
00:20:13.701 --> 00:20:18.701
<v Speaker 1>cleaning all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could be a very primordial </v>

319
00:20:18.701 --> 00:20:19.000
<v Speaker 1>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

320
00:20:19.001 --> 00:20:22.370
<v Speaker 1>she came in with this dream and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite upset and then you think,</v>

321
00:20:22.371 --> 00:20:24.260
<v Speaker 1>well there's a couple of things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do about that.</v>

322
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:29.150
<v Speaker 1>You could say it's just a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it,</v>

323
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.680
<v Speaker 1>go back to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

324
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.780
<v Speaker 1>that's a philosophical statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

325
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:34.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

326
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:39.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a misleading one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could argue that it was </v>

327
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.061
<v Speaker 1>misleading because what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a dream mean?</v>

328
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that it's certainly not </v>

329
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 1>something to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would take serious.</v>

330
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Take something that occurred during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

331
00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.610
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mirror like a fantasy,</v>

332
00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.630
<v Speaker 1>but with the definition of fantasy being</v>
<v Speaker 1>some fundamentally useless</v>

333
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.560
<v Speaker 1>act of what to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that you can ignore with no </v>

334
00:21:11.741 --> 00:21:16.741
<v Speaker 1>consequences and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should ignore it and you know </v>

335
00:21:16.741 --> 00:21:20.671
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily true because then</v>

336
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:26.971
<v Speaker 1>you're making the case or you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the case that you don't have to </v>

337
00:21:26.971 --> 00:21:27.790
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to products of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

338
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.300
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a pretty dopey thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell a child given a,</v>

339
00:21:31.301 --> 00:21:36.301
<v Speaker 1>that anything creative that you ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced is going to come out of your </v>

340
00:21:36.301 --> 00:21:39.691
<v Speaker 1>imagination and be the way that you set </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals and plans for your future is by </v>

341
00:21:39.851 --> 00:21:42.280
<v Speaker 1>imagining them dreaming about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

342
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows what it means to pursue a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream and you know you might say,</v>

343
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:47.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're depressed,</v>

344
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 1>it means all your dreams have </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

345
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like so maybe you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling your child that it's just a </v>

346
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 1>dream and so you can go.</v>

347
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.970
<v Speaker 1>You can ignore it and go back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

348
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't know exactly what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

349
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.850
<v Speaker 1>when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly not paying attention to</v>

350
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:08.851
<v Speaker 1>the child's experience because it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did have that image and it did make </v>

351
00:22:08.851 --> 00:22:13.441
<v Speaker 1>her upset and those are facts and as far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as people like Rogers would be </v>

352
00:22:13.441 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are facts about reality.</v>

353
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Are there elements of reality and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be dealt with as such.</v>

354
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:24.510
<v Speaker 1>So I told her to close her eyes and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring the dream image APP,</v>

355
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 1>inner imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she could do very well.</v>

356
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:34.620
<v Speaker 1>And then to imagine that she had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber boots on and that she could go </v>

357
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:39.421
<v Speaker 1>into the street and pick out the garbage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put it in the garbage bag and that </v>

358
00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:40.750
<v Speaker 1>there was a garbage can nearby and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>could put it in the garbage can.</v>

359
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:45.751
<v Speaker 1>And so we went through that and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>calmed her down and then she went back </v>

360
00:22:45.751 --> 00:22:45.940
<v Speaker 1>to bed.</v>

361
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:47.560
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

362
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.930
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing doing that?</v>

363
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

364
00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:59.671
<v Speaker 1>that's just a fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the dream and because they're </v>

365
00:22:59.671 --> 00:22:59.671
<v Speaker 1>just fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither of them have anything to do with</v>

366
00:22:59.671 --> 00:23:02.440
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know that again,</v>

367
00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:07.441
<v Speaker 1>that's not very sophisticated way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking because the dream presented my </v>

368
00:23:07.441 --> 00:23:11.011
<v Speaker 1>daughter with a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you could even say a class of </v>

369
00:23:11.011 --> 00:23:13.561
<v Speaker 1>problems and the class of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It includes all of those things that </v>

370
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.070
<v Speaker 1>people do too and I and other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

371
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:23.130
<v Speaker 1>all the ways that the environment can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>defiled well,</v>

372
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:27.340
<v Speaker 1>that actually is an existential problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might say,</v>

373
00:23:27.341 --> 00:23:30.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should you do about it now?</v>

374
00:23:30.391 --> 00:23:31.330
<v Speaker 1>So that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

375
00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:36.331
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should do something about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in so far as you can do something about </v>

376
00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it because then you're conceptualizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself as an active agent and not just</v>

377
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 1>a passive victim or a passive recipient </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the problem.</v>

378
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.110
<v Speaker 1>You could actually do something about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a way different messages.</v>

379
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Then it's just a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can ignore it and go back to sleep.</v>

380
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:57.010
<v Speaker 1>You know what you've maybe you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually tell your child to be ignoring </v>

381
00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:58.250
<v Speaker 1>reality and go back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should be telling them to wake</v>

382
00:23:58.251 --> 00:24:02.840
<v Speaker 1>up and see reality as clearly as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can and not ignore any of it,</v>

383
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.390
<v Speaker 1>including their fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In their dreams,</v>

384
00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:10.391
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't mean that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies have the same reality as the </v>

385
00:24:10.391 --> 00:24:11.930
<v Speaker 1>reality that you experience with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else,</v>

386
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:18.610
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it's not the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality that you experience with </v>

387
00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:18.610
<v Speaker 1>everyone else doesn't mean it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

388
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers would claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

389
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:26.651
<v Speaker 1>that to ignore a private experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>warps you fundamentally.</v>

390
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.400
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

391
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.730
<v Speaker 1>here's the basic outlines of his view of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

392
00:24:37.731 --> 00:24:42.731
<v Speaker 1>so there's first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you exist within a phenomenal logical </v>

393
00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now phenomenon.</v>

394
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenon comes from the Greek word </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous thigh and famous thigh means to </v>

395
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.531
<v Speaker 1>shine forth and so phenomena are those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that shine forth for you.</v>

396
00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Now the way to understand that is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're reading a book and </v>

397
00:25:00.561 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe a passage of it really strikes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>as meaningful.</v>

398
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

399
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.280
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of passages in the book.</v>

400
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:15.580
<v Speaker 1>If someone else was reading the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious that the same passage </v>

401
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.900
<v Speaker 1>would strike them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you might say,</v>

402
00:25:17.901 --> 00:25:22.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a consequence of the structure </v>

403
00:25:22.901 --> 00:25:22.901
<v Speaker 1>of you as as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

404
00:25:22.901 --> 00:25:26.680
<v Speaker 1>as an interpreter of the book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it a consequence of the contents </v>

405
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.191
<v Speaker 1>of the book and the answer to that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually can't tell because the book</v>

406
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:32.840
<v Speaker 1>is neither the thing that's printed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor the reader.</v>

407
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 1>The book is the interaction between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reader and the book,</v>

408
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.160
<v Speaker 1>and that interaction is actually unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>for each person.</v>

409
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Even though there might be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonalities across people because </v>

410
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:45.400
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you would need to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about a book.</v>

411
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

412
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:53.770
<v Speaker 1>regardless when you're interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

413
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.890
<v Speaker 1>some things announced themselves on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>field of consciousness and other things </v>

414
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.450
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the phenomenologists would say,</v>

415
00:26:01.451 --> 00:26:03.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something shine forth for you.</v>

416
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things don't.</v>

417
00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:11.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit like one of us ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the development of the self.</v>

418
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe that if you follow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that announced themselves to you </v>

419
00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:25.111
<v Speaker 1>as meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would take you to through a </v>

420
00:26:25.111 --> 00:26:30.031
<v Speaker 1>descent to begin with where you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter things you were afraid of or </v>

421
00:26:30.031 --> 00:26:32.380
<v Speaker 1>terrified of and disgusted by and wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to avoid.</v>

422
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.740
<v Speaker 1>And then the consequence of that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be that you do incorporate a lot of new </v>

423
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.251
<v Speaker 1>material into your personality and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that would be you'd be </v>

424
00:26:41.251 --> 00:26:42.880
<v Speaker 1>reborn roughly speaking as a stronger </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

425
00:26:42.881 --> 00:26:47.881
<v Speaker 1>and then if you just kept doing that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time for the rest of your life in </v>

426
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 1>small and large ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'd become more and more and more</v>

427
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.920
<v Speaker 1>fully differentiated and developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wouldn't have said that the the </v>

428
00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.300
<v Speaker 1>ultimate potential target of that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of development was what he described as </v>

429
00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:05.481
<v Speaker 1>the self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The self is a multifaceted </v>

430
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.840
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's not all there is to it,</v>

431
00:27:08.841 --> 00:27:13.841
<v Speaker 1>but the self from the union perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>is who you could be if you could be who </v>

432
00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:16.580
<v Speaker 1>you most deeply are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't shy away from anything,</v>

433
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:22.060
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you accurately encountered and then </v>

434
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.910
<v Speaker 1>integrated even in a pod and sense your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

435
00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Now that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the same idea that Rogers</v>

436
00:27:28.281 --> 00:27:30.860
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed that</v>

437
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a phenomenal field and it's full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of experience.</v>

438
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:41.270
<v Speaker 1>All of your experience manifests itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the phenomenal field is quite </v>

439
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:45.651
<v Speaker 1>interesting because if it means also </v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people are part of your </v>

440
00:27:45.651 --> 00:27:46.170
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of your experience,</v>

441
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:52.490
<v Speaker 1>and then that all within that field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a circumscribed area that he </v>

442
00:27:53.461 --> 00:27:56.490
<v Speaker 1>described as the self that's it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than the union itself,</v>

443
00:27:56.491 --> 00:28:01.491
<v Speaker 1>so it somewhat terminological confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger yourself is more like Freud's ego,</v>

444
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but Rogers would define myself as those </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of the phenomenological field </v>

445
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.830
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you call.</v>

446
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I've had clients who tended </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk in the third person about their </v>

447
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:27.291
<v Speaker 1>emotions or they would say the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't say I maybe they're </v>

448
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.760
<v Speaker 1>describing cutting themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd say,</v>

449
00:28:29.761 --> 00:28:34.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body needed to be cut,</v>

450
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:36.520
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

451
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.080
<v Speaker 1>what Rogers would say about that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

452
00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:48.450
<v Speaker 1>person existed in the phenomenological </v>
<v Speaker 1>field and part of that phenomenal </v>

453
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.090
<v Speaker 1>logical field was demarcated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>self,</v>

454
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:55.600
<v Speaker 1>like the self hadn't expanded to </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate as much of that </v>

455
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.270
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological field as it should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

456
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.800
<v Speaker 1>The other concept he had was the con.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another concept he had was the concept </v>

457
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.401
<v Speaker 1>of the organism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can think of the self as what </v>

458
00:29:06.681 --> 00:29:11.681
<v Speaker 1>you identified with it and then you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of the organism as all those </v>

459
00:29:11.991 --> 00:29:15.430
<v Speaker 1>things that are unique to you that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might identify with the art.</v>

460
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Now it's tricky because imagine that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get angry during a fight with someone </v>

461
00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.240
<v Speaker 1>argument and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're angry and you say,</v>

462
00:29:23.241 --> 00:29:25.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lost.</v>

463
00:29:25.101 --> 00:29:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Like what exactly are you doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other person we're gonna.</v>

464
00:29:28.581 --> 00:29:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Assume the other person is right for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sake of this argument.</v>

465
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.510
<v Speaker 1>They can clearly see that you're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not</v>

466
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:37.770
<v Speaker 2>allowing</v>

467
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:44.200
<v Speaker 1>the organismic manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational state or emotion to be </v>

468
00:29:44.231 --> 00:29:47.530
<v Speaker 1>incorporated with those things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with.</v>

469
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Rogers would call that into groans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he believed that incongruent was roughly</v>

470
00:29:59.001 --> 00:30:04.001
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to psychopathology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that part of your goal was to</v>

471
00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:13.220
<v Speaker 1>was for the organism to respond </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriately to the broader </v>

472
00:30:15.301 --> 00:30:18.870
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we can talk about what appropriately</v>

473
00:30:18.871 --> 00:30:20.340
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we won't do that yet,</v>

474
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.580
<v Speaker 1>and then what the self was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do is accurately symbolically represent </v>

475
00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.590
<v Speaker 1>organismic responses to the broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological field.</v>

476
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:34.970
<v Speaker 1>So now you can see that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities between that concept and </v>

477
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:39.771
<v Speaker 1>say Freud's idea of the ego and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know because the Ed was this sort of </v>

478
00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:44.391
<v Speaker 1>external thing that was the home of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational and emotional forces that </v>

479
00:30:45.361 --> 00:30:50.361
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be easily integrated into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ego and for partly because the Super Ego</v>

480
00:30:51.221 --> 00:30:52.350
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

481
00:30:52.351 --> 00:30:54.600
<v Speaker 1>that they were wrong and so there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

482
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:58.440
<v Speaker 1>these sets of phenomena you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all of the different clinicians are</v>

483
00:30:58.441 --> 00:31:03.441
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of them are talking about it </v>

484
00:31:03.441 --> 00:31:05.730
<v Speaker 1>starting from different initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions and it's like a group of</v>

485
00:31:05.731 --> 00:31:08.920
<v Speaker 1>people in the room shining a flashlight </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a very complex object.</v>

486
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:13.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all standing in a slightly </v>

487
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:13.920
<v Speaker 1>different position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The complex object is the same thing,</v>

488
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.961
<v Speaker 1>but you can only see parts of it and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need multiple different ways of </v>

489
00:31:17.961 --> 00:31:21.801
<v Speaker 1>looking at things so that you can come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with a cohesive and coherent account </v>

490
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.090
<v Speaker 1>of something that's actually beyond your</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>

491
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Because of course not only can you not </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately,</v>

492
00:31:28.741 --> 00:31:32.400
<v Speaker 1>symbolically represented the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological world,</v>

493
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:37.580
<v Speaker 1>the entire domain of your being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't accurately represent even the </v>

494
00:31:39.061 --> 00:31:44.061
<v Speaker 1>organismic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The aspect of that field that's related </v>

495
00:31:44.061 --> 00:31:48.270
<v Speaker 1>to the organismic you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this part of you on top that you</v>

496
00:31:48.271 --> 00:31:50.670
<v Speaker 1>identify with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I roughly speaking,</v>

497
00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:56.270
<v Speaker 1>and it's trying to model a model of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something very complex and of course </v>

498
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.100
<v Speaker 1>that's extraordinarily difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now why is it doing that?</v>

499
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the central mystery of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

500
00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:09.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this problem that consciousness </v>

501
00:32:09.571 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 1>researchers always refer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an annoyingly termed,</v>

502
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:16.831
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called the Zombie problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Zombie problem is why is </v>

503
00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:22.831
<v Speaker 1>consciousness necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it necessary for something </v>

504
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.970
<v Speaker 1>complex like a human being to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have awareness and self awareness?</v>

505
00:32:27.971 --> 00:32:32.971
<v Speaker 1>Why couldn't it just wander through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world reacting in predetermined </v>

506
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.980
<v Speaker 1>deterministic fashion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zombie like no awareness robot,</v>

507
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 1>like let's say what's consciousness for</v>

508
00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Rogers doesn't really discuss that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we won't at the moment.</v>

509
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Although I think there are some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable ideas.</v>

510
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

511
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I was using generalized between certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena anyways,</v>

512
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.840
<v Speaker 1>regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the self,</v>

513
00:33:03.841 --> 00:33:06.150
<v Speaker 1>the organism in the broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenological field.</v>

514
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you go into a</v>

515
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>pub bar</v>

516
00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been there many times and so you </v>

517
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:23.610
<v Speaker 1>know the people in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where to sit.</v>

518
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.220
<v Speaker 1>You know what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have friends there,</v>

519
00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:29.010
<v Speaker 1>you might say that your organism</v>

520
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.230
<v Speaker 2>exists</v>

521
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.190
<v Speaker 1>at least in part as a very accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>model of that broader,</v>

522
00:33:35.191 --> 00:33:36.360
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical world,</v>

523
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 1>and then inside that you're aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your knowledge of them,</v>

524
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.390
<v Speaker 2>the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so</v>

525
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:54.250
<v Speaker 1>if your organism is properly adapted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the broader phenomenological field,</v>

526
00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.600
<v Speaker 1>when you go into the bar or other </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar place,</v>

527
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.960
<v Speaker 1>things that you expect and want happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of things that you neither </v>

528
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.040
<v Speaker 1>expect nor one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could say,</v>

529
00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:10.480
<v Speaker 1>well perhaps that's a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of adaptation.</v>

530
00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Now this isn't biological revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification,</v>

531
00:34:13.521 --> 00:34:15.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is personal adaptations.</v>

532
00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:20.740
<v Speaker 1>There are similar in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but importantly different mean you can </v>

533
00:34:21.521 --> 00:34:26.521
<v Speaker 1>be adapted to an environment without </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in any way having any effect </v>

534
00:34:26.521 --> 00:34:27.280
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever on your evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptiveness.</v>

535
00:34:27.281 --> 00:34:27.490
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

536
00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:36.870
<v Speaker 1>now if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not very well organism </v>

537
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:41.130
<v Speaker 1>actually adapted to the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a model of it and because of </v>

538
00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.270
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go somewhere familiar,</v>

539
00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:48.390
<v Speaker 1>people don't like you as much as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they do and you're not nearly as </v>

540
00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:52.621
<v Speaker 1>much of a master of that situation as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you are and one of the </v>

541
00:34:52.621 --> 00:34:56.341
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would mean that your self </v>

542
00:34:56.341 --> 00:34:58.920
<v Speaker 1>representation is too rigid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplistic and full of defenses to </v>

543
00:34:59.051 --> 00:35:04.051
<v Speaker 1>notice the discrepancy between your </v>
<v Speaker 1>organism and the broader environment </v>

544
00:35:04.051 --> 00:35:08.100
<v Speaker 1>that's pathological and the way that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be marked is first by anxiety.</v>

545
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you tell a joke.</v>

546
00:35:10.721 --> 00:35:15.721
<v Speaker 1>There's some people sitting around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell a joke and you see people kind </v>

547
00:35:15.721 --> 00:35:15.721
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

548
00:35:15.721 --> 00:35:16.540
<v Speaker 1>making that face maybe rolling their </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

549
00:35:16.541 --> 00:35:18.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's not exactly.</v>

550
00:35:18.081 --> 00:35:18.730
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

551
00:35:18.731 --> 00:35:19.600
<v Speaker 1>they're joking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

552
00:35:19.601 --> 00:35:21.010
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just teasing me.</v>

553
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're damn sick of your stupid </v>

554
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.651
<v Speaker 1>stories and you've told them 50 times </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not very funny and they'd </v>

555
00:35:28.651 --> 00:35:31.690
<v Speaker 1>rather you work in the bar at all and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>may be that you'll actually notice that,</v>

556
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:37.290
<v Speaker 1>but you don't necessarily notice it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically fully symbolically </v>

557
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.700
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

558
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:43.850
<v Speaker 1>what that would mean is maybe you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling anxiety and Roger's identify as </v>

559
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:49.401
<v Speaker 1>different levels of feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might start with this subception and </v>

560
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.280
<v Speaker 1>to succeed something which is a word </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I guess comes from general </v>

561
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.151
<v Speaker 1>semantics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to have the event affect the way that</v>

562
00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:07.620
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with the world in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that you don't necessarily notice,</v>

563
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:13.010
<v Speaker 1>so it sort of equivalent to the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>subliminal when you're talking about </v>

564
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:17.271
<v Speaker 1>advertising messages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flashed out unit suddenly changes the </v>

565
00:36:17.271 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 1>way that you're interacting with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

566
00:36:18.481 --> 00:36:23.481
<v Speaker 1>but you don't notice that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That and that happens to people all the </v>

567
00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:23.481
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

568
00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's actually a part of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal cognitive structure and when you </v>

569
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.911
<v Speaker 1>walk into this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room tells you all sorts of things </v>

570
00:36:28.911 --> 00:36:32.901
<v Speaker 1>about how to behave and you don't notice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the room is telling you those </v>

571
00:36:32.901 --> 00:36:35.310
<v Speaker 1>things because you know what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you so well that you just act it</v>

572
00:36:35.311 --> 00:36:40.311
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to go through all the </v>

573
00:36:40.311 --> 00:36:41.280
<v Speaker 1>complex processes of actually perceiving</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thinking about it,</v>

574
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:45.720
<v Speaker 1>and so Roger's oranges that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>detect things organismic Lee.</v>

575
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.500
<v Speaker 1>That will affect the nature of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience without necessarily either </v>

576
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 1>even perceiving that or definitely not </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically representing it.</v>

577
00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe the social discomfort that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>inherent in the situation rises up to </v>

578
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:04.680
<v Speaker 1>the level of perception that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolization yet.</v>

579
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

580
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.760
<v Speaker 1>what does it feel like to be anxious?</v>

581
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

582
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:17.510
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not asking what are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective markers of being anxious </v>

583
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:19.860
<v Speaker 1>because we actually don't know those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know we can kind of infer them.</v>

584
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people's heart rate goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it decelerates and then </v>

585
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.090
<v Speaker 1>there are facial expressions that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with anxiety,</v>

586
00:37:27.091 --> 00:37:30.240
<v Speaker 1>but you have to use those to infer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get anxious,</v>

587
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel your anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to infer it,</v>

588
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:38.120
<v Speaker 1>but if you get anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel your anxiety and so then the </v>

589
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:38.120
<v Speaker 1>question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

590
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.090
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to feel anxious?</v>

591
00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Wealth?</v>

592
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard question and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard question is because you </v>

593
00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:48.790
<v Speaker 1>never have to answer it because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell someone I felt anxious,</v>

594
00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:52.570
<v Speaker 1>then they refer to their own feelings of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and then they know what you mean</v>

595
00:37:52.571 --> 00:37:56.050
<v Speaker 1>and you never have to come up with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation of what it feels like.</v>

596
00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:01.860
<v Speaker 1>The feeling this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the feeling is an element </v>

597
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.910
<v Speaker 1>of experience is something that we just </v>
<v Speaker 1>take for granted.</v>

598
00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got angry today.</v>

599
00:38:05.591 --> 00:38:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Everybody nods or maybe I tell a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and say,</v>

600
00:38:07.841 --> 00:38:08.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

601
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I got on the bus and I was missing like </v>
<v Speaker 1>two cents and I asked the bus driver if </v>

602
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:16.090
<v Speaker 1>he would let me get on the bus and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't and not really annoyed me because</v>

603
00:38:16.091 --> 00:38:21.091
<v Speaker 1>I take that bus everyday and the driver </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows me and I got angry and everybody </v>

604
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:21.091
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

605
00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.850
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they nod is a partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can imagine that that's how</v>

606
00:38:24.851 --> 00:38:26.410
<v Speaker 1>they would have reacted in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

607
00:38:26.411 --> 00:38:31.411
<v Speaker 1>But even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they accept the reality of angry as a </v>

608
00:38:31.411 --> 00:38:33.310
<v Speaker 1>response and they know what it feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

609
00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:39.330
<v Speaker 1>So explaining it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a much more difficult thing,</v>

610
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:45.610
<v Speaker 1>so the point is is that you can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences that you know of.</v>

611
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:50.670
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have experiences that you don't </v>

612
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.670
<v Speaker 1>know of that would be the subsea </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

613
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:54.631
<v Speaker 1>Then you can have experiences that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive but that you haven't </v>

614
00:38:54.631 --> 00:38:58.831
<v Speaker 1>symbolically represented and those might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be emotional or motivational </v>

615
00:38:58.831 --> 00:39:01.801
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can have experiences that </v>

616
00:39:01.801 --> 00:39:04.741
<v Speaker 1>you have symbolically represented in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that captures their just accurately </v>

617
00:39:04.741 --> 00:39:09.570
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's reflective of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation or lack thereof to the </v>

618
00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:13.411
<v Speaker 1>broader phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logical world and Rogers would say that </v>

619
00:39:13.411 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 1>latter state is preferable.</v>

620
00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:21.530
<v Speaker 1>You know how to act or you know that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't act properly and you know how to </v>

621
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:27.271
<v Speaker 1>fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is almost as good and you </v>

622
00:39:27.271 --> 00:39:29.671
<v Speaker 1>represent that accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might imagine that you could </v>

623
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:34.891
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on the mismatch between </v>
<v Speaker 1>organismic responses and the </v>

624
00:39:34.891 --> 00:39:39.301
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what behavior therapists really </v>

625
00:39:39.301 --> 00:39:39.301
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

626
00:39:39.301 --> 00:39:43.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you acting and what are the </v>

627
00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:46.501
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't really where Roger's </v>

628
00:39:46.501 --> 00:39:49.381
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers is more psychoanalytic than the </v>

629
00:39:49.381 --> 00:39:54.271
<v Speaker 1>behavior therapists and what he seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be primarily concerned about is whether </v>

630
00:39:54.271 --> 00:39:58.621
<v Speaker 1>or not your self representation is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate representation of of how your </v>

631
00:39:58.751 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 1>organism is responding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>

632
00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 1>for Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organism takes the place of God.</v>

633
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:10.290
<v Speaker 1>It's more or less omniscient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your organism is going to tell you </v>

634
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:15.781
<v Speaker 1>the truth in every situation and it's up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you whether or not you're going to </v>

635
00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:21.570
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to that and make sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or whether you're going to engage in </v>

636
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:27.571
<v Speaker 1>any of the different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shenanigans that you might engage in to </v>

637
00:40:27.571 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 1>stop yourself from going through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex process of symbolization.</v>

638
00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Because you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

639
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.440
<v Speaker 1>you're back in the bar and you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

640
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:40.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you notice the anxiety and then you </v>

641
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:40.590
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways of symbolizing it.</v>

642
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Come to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are all people are all just</v>

643
00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.560
<v Speaker 1>jerks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another thing comes to mind is,</v>

644
00:40:47.561 --> 00:40:49.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe nobody likes me.</v>

645
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:54.810
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe another idea that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with symbolization comes to </v>

646
00:40:55.061 --> 00:40:55.690
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

647
00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:01.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's elements of my social </v>

648
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.271
<v Speaker 1>behavior that I should adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I presume that if Roger's was having</v>

649
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:07.390
<v Speaker 1>a conversation with one of his clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would assume that that was the most,</v>

650
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.460
<v Speaker 1>that was the most fruitful potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>step towards accurate symbolization.</v>

651
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Now Roger's felt that anxiety emerged </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the self concept was not accurately</v>

652
00:41:21.041 --> 00:41:24.730
<v Speaker 1>symbolically representing the organisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

653
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:30.360
<v Speaker 1>and so that would be in some sense if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a house divided within yourself,</v>

654
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.760
<v Speaker 1>then you're your pathological from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogerian perspective.</v>

655
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:40.030
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about that in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense as a move away from necessary.</v>

656
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Simplicity</v>

657
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.620
<v Speaker 2>mean</v>

658
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:49.700
<v Speaker 1>if your self concept is set up property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't contain contradictory and </v>

659
00:41:50.221 --> 00:41:53.460
<v Speaker 1>misleading bits of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything works seamlessly together.</v>

660
00:41:53.461 --> 00:41:56.970
<v Speaker 1>And so what that would mean is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about something,</v>

661
00:41:56.971 --> 00:42:01.971
<v Speaker 1>you act it out and it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that's an indication that the </v>

662
00:42:02.491 --> 00:42:07.491
<v Speaker 1>organization between say these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>three different levels of being is the </v>

663
00:42:08.071 --> 00:42:13.071
<v Speaker 1>right word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is icer morphing each represents the </v>

664
00:42:13.071 --> 00:42:15.651
<v Speaker 1>other with sufficient accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that you're congruent </v>

665
00:42:15.651 --> 00:42:20.640
<v Speaker 1>and if you're congruent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the world is treating you not only </v>

666
00:42:22.141 --> 00:42:23.730
<v Speaker 1>in the manner that you want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>treated,</v>

667
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.120
<v Speaker 1>but also in the manner that's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely.</v>

668
00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:28.270
<v Speaker 2>Two</v>

669
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.170
<v Speaker 1>further your actions in the world as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>organism,</v>

670
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:38.950
<v Speaker 1>and so that's partly why Rogers believed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the organism had wisdom because </v>

671
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:43.600
<v Speaker 1>it's natural proclivity was to operate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world effectively and to expand </v>

672
00:42:45.501 --> 00:42:50.501
<v Speaker 1>its competence at the same time and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>self actualized person because that's </v>

673
00:42:51.381 --> 00:42:56.360
<v Speaker 1>one of Roger's phrases is someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>self concept accurately represents their</v>

674
00:42:56.361 --> 00:42:56.990
<v Speaker 1>organismic</v>

675
00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:57.810
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

676
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers was primarily a clinician as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

677
00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:16.890
<v Speaker 1>and his theories were derived from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical experience and his theories </v>

678
00:43:19.211 --> 00:43:24.211
<v Speaker 1>informed his clinical practice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger's invented or developed what he </v>

679
00:43:25.181 --> 00:43:30.160
<v Speaker 1>believed to be a new kind of therapy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called that client centered therapy.</v>

680
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Now you've probably heard about student </v>
<v Speaker 1>centered education in Rogers.</v>

681
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I ideas have had a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

682
00:43:37.121 --> 00:43:39.340
<v Speaker 1>certainly not at least in educational </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

683
00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Also in conflict reduction of various </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts.</v>

684
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 1>You start with Rogers initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions,</v>

685
00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:52.631
<v Speaker 1>which is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should regard your experience as </v>

686
00:43:52.631 --> 00:43:53.810
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

687
00:43:53.811 --> 00:43:58.811
<v Speaker 1>that your organism will give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate information about the totality </v>

688
00:43:58.811 --> 00:44:03.611
<v Speaker 1>of experience and third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your self concept should accurately</v>

689
00:44:05.091 --> 00:44:10.091
<v Speaker 1>encompass your actual experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are implications of that theory </v>

690
00:44:10.091 --> 00:44:14.351
<v Speaker 1>for therapy and one of the implications </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you can figure out what you </v>

691
00:44:14.661 --> 00:44:19.661
<v Speaker 1>should do if you want to because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>organism will tell you or at least hint </v>

692
00:44:23.841 --> 00:44:28.180
<v Speaker 1>at you about which directions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct and which directions are,</v>

693
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.330
<v Speaker 1>and if you follow those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to naturally gravitate</v>

694
00:44:33.331 --> 00:44:38.331
<v Speaker 1>towards a state of being where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more accurately represented by </v>

695
00:44:38.331 --> 00:44:42.111
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that your representation and </v>

696
00:44:42.111 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 1>your organism are going to act more </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively in the world.</v>

697
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:49.431
<v Speaker 1>They're not bumping up against each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other all the time and you know they're </v>

698
00:44:49.971 --> 00:44:54.971
<v Speaker 1>not even conflict anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the goal of the self </v>

699
00:44:55.081 --> 00:45:00.081
<v Speaker 1>actualized person at therapy in part is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the art of furthering that process of </v>

700
00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:07.480
<v Speaker 1>self actualization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

701
00:45:07.481 --> 00:45:12.481
<v Speaker 1>Rogers Rogers</v>

702
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:20.210
<v Speaker 1>was opposed to diagnosis because he felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it didn't sufficiently represent </v>

703
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:32.120
<v Speaker 1>the vital minutia of the client's </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual experience and I think </v>

704
00:45:35.611 --> 00:45:40.611
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that his claim was extremely </v>

705
00:45:40.891 --> 00:45:42.530
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

706
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:47.630
<v Speaker 1>because medicine psychiatry tends to </v>
<v Speaker 1>classify everything and you might say,</v>

707
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:57.891
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the psychiatric diagnostic </v>

708
00:45:57.891 --> 00:45:58.950
<v Speaker 1>classifications real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the answer that is,</v>

709
00:45:58.951 --> 00:46:02.260
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by real </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

710
00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Think well that's an annoying answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>

711
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:10.370
<v Speaker 1>It is still the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could say if I was being cynical,</v>

712
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 1>although I don't really think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical response,</v>

713
00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:18.650
<v Speaker 1>if I was willing to sound cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only reason that psychiatrist </v>

714
00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.920
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed their clients is so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance companies can pay the bills </v>

715
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.190
<v Speaker 1>and I actually believe that that's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>true than the claim,</v>

716
00:46:26.191 --> 00:46:31.191
<v Speaker 1>that the psychiatric diagnostic </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories accurately actually capture </v>

717
00:46:31.191 --> 00:46:35.480
<v Speaker 1>the essence of the person's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my clinical experience,</v>

718
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:42.440
<v Speaker 1>classification has had almost zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility and the reason for that is </v>

719
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:48.291
<v Speaker 1>because it's too low resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't capture the individual </v>

720
00:46:48.291 --> 00:46:51.741
<v Speaker 1>property because the thing about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>client clinical client is that it's </v>

721
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:57.420
<v Speaker 1>precisely their individuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental issue.</v>

722
00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:02.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have to make their way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the world in their body and </v>

723
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:06.831
<v Speaker 1>their in their time and their position </v>
<v Speaker 1>in culture with their advantages and </v>

724
00:47:07.231 --> 00:47:12.231
<v Speaker 1>disadvantages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that requires a unique solution </v>

725
00:47:13.771 --> 00:47:17.070
<v Speaker 1>that's unique in many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one that's also personally</v>

726
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:26.150
<v Speaker 1>and rogers also wasn't a particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>great fan of the psychoanalysts tendency</v>

727
00:47:29.651 --> 00:47:34.651
<v Speaker 1>to look for the causes of present </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior in past events so he didn't.</v>

728
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 1>He didn't regard fishing in the past as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a useful,</v>

729
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:47.790
<v Speaker 1>necessarily useful expedition or as </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary expedition.</v>

730
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Although if issues of the past came up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in therapy,</v>

731
00:47:51.011 --> 00:47:56.011
<v Speaker 1>he was perfectly willing to to to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

732
00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:01.860
<v Speaker 1>He didn't accept except the Freudian </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that the fundamental cause of </v>

733
00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:06.451
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology was saying traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>past experience.</v>

734
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Right</v>

735
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:15.770
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gives Rogerian therapy a particular</v>

736
00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:20.830
<v Speaker 1>flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could also call it non directive </v>

737
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:24.140
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you're a behavior therapist,</v>

738
00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:33.070
<v Speaker 1>you might actively strategize with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>client about what they're going to do in</v>

739
00:48:33.561 --> 00:48:37.010
<v Speaker 1>the next week and then once they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>established their goals,</v>

740
00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:42.700
<v Speaker 1>you might offer some hints about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies they could use to monitor </v>

741
00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:46.991
<v Speaker 1>themselves and to attain those goals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll even have to keep track of </v>

742
00:48:47.001 --> 00:48:50.000
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger's generally speaking,</v>

743
00:48:50.001 --> 00:48:55.001
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do something that directive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact he strove not to unduly </v>

744
00:48:56.031 --> 00:48:59.870
<v Speaker 1>influenced the client's decisions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>important future events.</v>

745
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:04.890
<v Speaker 1>And in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was quite similar to Freud because </v>

746
00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Freud would sit behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would sit,</v>

747
00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.380
<v Speaker 1>so the client would be laying on a couch</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fred would sit so that the client is</v>

748
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:16.390
<v Speaker 1>patient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually couldn't see him and then he </v>

749
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.390
<v Speaker 1>would listen to the person free </v>
<v Speaker 1>associate,</v>

750
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:21.281
<v Speaker 1>which in some sense means that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would ramble on and he was attempting by</v>

751
00:49:21.531 --> 00:49:26.531
<v Speaker 1>doing that to facilitate the self </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization of their,</v>

752
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:29.840
<v Speaker 1>of their own memories.</v>

753
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.100
<v Speaker 1>If things happened to you in your past </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they still cause you emotion,</v>

754
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:36.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say they're more than 18 months </v>
<v Speaker 1>old for the sake of argument,</v>

755
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but assume that if you kind of wandered </v>

756
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:44.891
<v Speaker 1>around that memory somewhat haphazardly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in an in an association will weigh </v>

757
00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:50.130
<v Speaker 1>the way conversations naturally unfold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would bring things to light and</v>

758
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:52.820
<v Speaker 1>that would allow a certain kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional expression in that.</v>

759
00:49:52.821 --> 00:49:57.821
<v Speaker 1>And in fact in itself would be curative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for I didn't want to with your fear </v>

760
00:49:57.821 --> 00:49:59.330
<v Speaker 1>with that process or guided to any great</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

761
00:49:59.331 --> 00:50:04.331
<v Speaker 1>And so rogers was like that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted you to make your own </v>

762
00:50:04.331 --> 00:50:07.331
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he believed that the therapeutic </v>

763
00:50:07.331 --> 00:50:11.051
<v Speaker 1>endeavor required could not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could not occur unless certain </v>

764
00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.520
<v Speaker 1>conditions were met and the conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>were</v>

765
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:26.190
<v Speaker 1>willingness to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

766
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 1>when a client comes to see me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things I tell them is,</v>

767
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:37.990
<v Speaker 1>you can tell me anything you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you're perfectly within your </v>

768
00:50:38.361 --> 00:50:42.320
<v Speaker 1>rights to maintain your privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell me anything you want,</v>

769
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:45.080
<v Speaker 1>but tell me the truth as much as clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can.</v>

770
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't.</v>

771
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:51.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's not a possibility on any </v>

772
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:55.361
<v Speaker 1>possibility at all that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this process will be useful if </v>

773
00:50:55.611 --> 00:50:57.710
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about things that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

774
00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.490
<v Speaker 1>So one precondition is the person is </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to come and see you.</v>

775
00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.960
<v Speaker 1>So that means they want to transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second precondition is that they're </v>

776
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.081
<v Speaker 1>going to communicate with you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication means they're going to do </v>

777
00:51:11.081 --> 00:51:13.310
<v Speaker 1>their best to tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the therapist takes the same</v>

778
00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:20.520
<v Speaker 1>vow in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I tell my </v>

779
00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:23.431
<v Speaker 1>clients is that I will never let them do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that makes me resent them.</v>

780
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:29.700
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm asked to step out of my way </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason to take an additional </v>

781
00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.230
<v Speaker 1>session or maybe to meet them somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do it,</v>

782
00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:37.620
<v Speaker 1>they can be assured that there won't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a price that will be extracted from them</v>

783
00:51:38.861 --> 00:51:43.750
<v Speaker 1>later for interfering with the smooth </v>
<v Speaker 1>flow of my day.</v>

784
00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:48.760
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing that I do,</v>

785
00:51:48.761 --> 00:51:52.120
<v Speaker 1>and I've learned this from Rogers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the other people I've read,</v>

786
00:51:52.121 --> 00:51:57.121
<v Speaker 1>is that I'll listen to people talk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then sometimes something will occur to </v>

787
00:51:57.701 --> 00:52:02.701
<v Speaker 1>me and I don't think about it as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought something because I'm actually </v>

788
00:52:04.601 --> 00:52:06.970
<v Speaker 1>somewhat a follower of nickname.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's dictum,</v>

789
00:52:06.971 --> 00:52:10.310
<v Speaker 1>which is that the fact that you think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no approved,</v>

790
00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:15.330
<v Speaker 1>that the fact that you experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts is no proof that you thought it</v>

791
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:22.130
<v Speaker 1>just appeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you don't think that you think </v>

792
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:23.050
<v Speaker 1>that your dreams right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your dreams.</v>

793
00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.110
<v Speaker 1>There you are in band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the dreams.</v>

794
00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Are you having them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

795
00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:34.080
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you're experiencing this </v>

796
00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.750
<v Speaker 1>in some sense the same way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced the external world </v>

797
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:37.570
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily creating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

798
00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:40.600
<v Speaker 1>why do you think anything different </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your thoughts?</v>

799
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize by the way because otherwise you</v>

800
00:52:46.311 --> 00:52:48.620
<v Speaker 1>think your your thoughts and then if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have negative thoughts,</v>

801
00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:53.621
<v Speaker 1>well then you assume that they're true </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not true just because you </v>

802
00:52:53.621 --> 00:52:58.391
<v Speaker 1>think that they are just thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're true and maybe they're </v>

803
00:52:58.391 --> 00:53:01.121
<v Speaker 1>useful and maybe they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stepping back from them a little bit </v>

804
00:53:01.121 --> 00:53:05.020
<v Speaker 1>is incredibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like Buddhist detachment in a </v>

805
00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:05.180
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredibly useful thing to do.</v>

806
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's another thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really characteristic of modern people </v>

807
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.361
<v Speaker 1>because especially if they're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they think first of all and </v>

808
00:53:13.361 --> 00:53:18.161
<v Speaker 1>second they think that the things they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think are true and neither of those </v>

809
00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:21.530
<v Speaker 1>things are necessarily true and </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoning your belief in them.</v>

810
00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:26.531
<v Speaker 1>It makes you much less rigid and much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more able to expand your preconceptions </v>

811
00:53:33.031 --> 00:53:36.180
<v Speaker 1>or even radically change them when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances demand them.</v>

812
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:42.650
<v Speaker 1>So the person has to be wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change in principal in a positive </v>

813
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:51.381
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to be willing to tell the </v>

814
00:53:51.381 --> 00:53:53.811
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the next element of Rogerian </v>

815
00:53:53.811 --> 00:53:56.780
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is something that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>called unconditional positive regard and</v>

816
00:54:01.461 --> 00:54:06.461
<v Speaker 1>unconditional positive regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Rogerian tradition is something </v>

817
00:54:06.461 --> 00:54:11.081
<v Speaker 1>like radical acceptance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a hallmark of modern child</v>

818
00:54:12.321 --> 00:54:17.321
<v Speaker 1>rearing techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should wholeheartedly accept all </v>

819
00:54:17.391 --> 00:54:22.391
<v Speaker 1>aspects of the person's being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers believed that are positive,</v>

820
00:54:28.071 --> 00:54:32.000
<v Speaker 1>that partly because he also believed in</v>

821
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.940
<v Speaker 2>what was it called,</v>

822
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.670
<v Speaker 1>conditions of worth.</v>

823
00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Here's the condition of worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like you when you act like that,</v>

824
00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:54.400
<v Speaker 1>so you imagine you might tell a child </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't like you when you act like </v>

825
00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.100
<v Speaker 1>that and maybe you tell them that about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of things that they do,</v>

826
00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:04.330
<v Speaker 1>but maybe those are integral parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the child's being and by making your </v>

827
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:10.310
<v Speaker 1>lack of acceptance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

828
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.930
<v Speaker 1>you make it impossible for the child to </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate.</v>

829
00:55:14.931 --> 00:55:19.931
<v Speaker 1>Those aspects of his organism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Organism will experience into a self </v>

830
00:55:19.931 --> 00:55:24.011
<v Speaker 1>concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see echoes of the Super Ego </v>

831
00:55:24.011 --> 00:55:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Eagle idea there and so rogers would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

832
00:55:27.501 --> 00:55:32.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone comes into psychotherapy and </v>

833
00:55:32.501 --> 00:55:32.900
<v Speaker 1>experiences unconditional positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard,</v>

834
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:38.470
<v Speaker 1>that means that they'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveal those elements up their </v>

835
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:42.370
<v Speaker 1>organismic experience that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected and say by the social world and</v>

836
00:55:42.531 --> 00:55:47.531
<v Speaker 1>themselves experienced them and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially incorporate them within the </v>

837
00:55:48.651 --> 00:55:53.651
<v Speaker 1>self concept and that that's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good thing because rogers is a great </v>

838
00:55:53.651 --> 00:55:57.800
<v Speaker 1>believer in the natural inevitability of</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive transformation.</v>

839
00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:03.490
<v Speaker 1>If if you set that up as your your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also believes that that should be </v>

840
00:56:04.341 --> 00:56:08.060
<v Speaker 1>your goal and that it's actually your </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural goal.</v>

841
00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:10.520
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

842
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:15.020
<v Speaker 1>you haven't been subjected to arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of worth,</v>

843
00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.410
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to read you something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rodger's road,</v>

844
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:27.160
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting and I think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>found it extremely effective.</v>

845
00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing I should mention.</v>

846
00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:48.020
<v Speaker 1>There is one other important assumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the idea of self actualization.</v>

847
00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.920
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that Roger tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure that his clients develop was </v>

848
00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:04.530
<v Speaker 1>autonomy and independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for Rogers,</v>

849
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:11.360
<v Speaker 1>there was very little difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the move towards autonomy and in any and</v>

850
00:57:11.731 --> 00:57:15.840
<v Speaker 1>personal independence and the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>self actualization.</v>

851
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

852
00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.370
<v Speaker 1>given that we're looking back at Roger's</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

853
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:31.750
<v Speaker 1>50 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might ask yourself is if autonomy </v>

854
00:57:34.791 --> 00:57:39.791
<v Speaker 1>and independence is a necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>precondition for psychological health </v>

855
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:45.960
<v Speaker 1>because you could make the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive interdependence and more </v>

856
00:57:47.781 --> 00:57:52.781
<v Speaker 1>communal orientation is equally healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a Rogerian </v>

857
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:56.140
<v Speaker 1>presupposition,</v>

858
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:57.950
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

859
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:02.210
<v Speaker 1>his ideal is the fully functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

860
00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:15.500
<v Speaker 1>So here's his hypothesis with regards to</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy,</v>

861
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:22.750
<v Speaker 1>assuming a minimal mutual willingness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in contact and to receive </v>

862
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:27.341
<v Speaker 1>communications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may say that the greater the </v>

863
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:31.151
<v Speaker 1>communicated congruence of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness and behavior on the part of </v>

864
00:58:31.151 --> 00:58:34.991
<v Speaker 1>one individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the ensuing relationship will </v>

865
00:58:34.991 --> 00:58:37.040
<v Speaker 1>involve a tendency towards reciprocal </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication with the same qualities,</v>

866
00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:41.870
<v Speaker 1>mutually accurate understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication's improved,</v>

867
00:58:41.871 --> 00:58:46.871
<v Speaker 1>psychological adjustment and functioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>in both parties and mutual satisfaction </v>

868
00:58:46.871 --> 00:58:48.140
<v Speaker 1>in the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

869
00:58:48.141 --> 00:58:52.850
<v Speaker 1>so let's unpack that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to</v>

870
00:58:52.851 --> 00:58:55.520
<v Speaker 1>be in contact and to receive </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication well,</v>

871
00:58:55.521 --> 00:58:58.250
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you might say is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much thought the hallmark of</v>

872
00:58:58.251 --> 00:59:00.590
<v Speaker 1>a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

873
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're not in contact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well clearly you don't have a </v>

874
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:07.070
<v Speaker 1>relationship and if you are in contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not communicating,</v>

875
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.880
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't have a relationship.</v>

876
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

877
00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:17.930
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that also begs the question of exactly </v>

878
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:20.031
<v Speaker 1>what a relationship is for and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's very much worth </v>

879
00:59:20.031 --> 00:59:22.880
<v Speaker 1>considering because people don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually know what a relationship is for.</v>

880
00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.810
<v Speaker 1>They certainly know that as a general </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule they're going to pursue them,</v>

881
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:32.140
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really have any idea in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense what the optimal state is or </v>

882
00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:34.670
<v Speaker 1>what the desired final state should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

883
00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 1>of course the desired final state 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago was marriage,</v>

884
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:42.330
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>

885
00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly the case now that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are couples aren't married.</v>

886
00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

887
00:59:48.941 --> 00:59:53.941
<v Speaker 1>what's the utility of a relationship and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the utility of a long term </v>

888
00:59:54.041 --> 00:59:56.730
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

889
00:59:56.731 --> 01:00:01.731
<v Speaker 1>the Rogerian answer to that would be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>more based on trust the relationship is </v>

890
01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>the more likely that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in contact and to receive communications</v>

891
01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>and then as a consequence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to become better and better</v>

892
01:00:25.871 --> 01:00:30.871
<v Speaker 1>at representing your organismal </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience within your self concept,</v>

893
01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:36.910
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to facilitate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement towards self awareness and self</v>

894
01:00:36.911 --> 01:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>actualization.</v>

895
01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brains are better than one idea.</v>

896
01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>So we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

897
01:00:44.111 --> 01:00:46.270
<v Speaker 1>we established a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

898
01:00:46.271 --> 01:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and the goal of our relationship is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make things better,</v>

899
01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>and we we make a presupposition that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way you make things better is by telling</v>

900
01:00:55.781 --> 01:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>the truth as you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remember,</v>

901
01:00:58.271 --> 01:01:03.271
<v Speaker 1>this is a phenomenological theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the truth that Rogers is talking </v>

902
01:01:03.641 --> 01:01:08.641
<v Speaker 1>about isn't objective truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect that at least in part </v>

903
01:01:08.641 --> 01:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>because establishing objective truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the confines of a relationship is</v>

904
01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I think it's technically impossible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about that before because each</v>

905
01:01:16.691 --> 01:01:21.691
<v Speaker 1>interaction between the members of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple or people in any relationship is </v>

906
01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:26.380
<v Speaker 1>contaminated in a sense by all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other interactions they've ever had.</v>

907
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Plus everything they bring to bear on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation and there's just no </v>

908
01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>untangling that objectively know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you mean when you said that</v>

909
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.850
<v Speaker 2>that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

910
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can argue about that for</v>

911
01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>to the point of divorce and for 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

912
01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without ever coming to a satisfactory </v>

913
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

914
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>The greatest greater the communicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>congruence of experience,</v>

915
01:01:51.211 --> 01:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>awareness and behavior on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one individual.</v>

916
01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:58.820
<v Speaker 1>The more the ensuing relationship will </v>
<v Speaker 1>involve a tendency towards reciprocal </v>

917
01:01:58.820 --> 01:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>communication with the same qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

918
01:01:59.401 --> 01:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>so here's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go see a psychotherapist,</v>

919
01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>a registered psychotherapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle.</v>

920
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>This is someone who's mastered or is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>tempting to master these basic modes of </v>

921
01:02:11.731 --> 01:02:16.731
<v Speaker 1>being?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they're going to do is they'll </v>

922
01:02:16.731 --> 01:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you the truth as I see</v>

923
01:02:17.341 --> 01:02:22.341
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the way I see that happening in </v>

924
01:02:22.341 --> 01:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is that when someone comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see me,</v>

925
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I listened to them and that means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not distracted by anything else.</v>

926
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about what I'm going to</v>

927
01:02:32.941 --> 01:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>say next.</v>

928
01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about the things I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do today.</v>

929
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about the last time I </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw this person.</v>

930
01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:45.831
<v Speaker 1>I'm not allowing my attention to wander </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the person and then I'm </v>

931
01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:51.441
<v Speaker 1>watching them and listening to them at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time and those are the same </v>

932
01:02:51.441 --> 01:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>things because to really listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

933
01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:57.921
<v Speaker 1>you also have to watch them because then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you succeed perhaps or perceive of the </v>

934
01:02:57.921 --> 01:03:00.390
<v Speaker 1>nonverbal elements of communication that</v>
<v Speaker 1>go along with,</v>

935
01:03:00.391 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly with voice tone,</v>

936
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:06.651
<v Speaker 1>but apparently with direction and partly</v>
<v Speaker 1>with very subtle transformations of </v>

937
01:03:06.651 --> 01:03:07.560
<v Speaker 1>facial gesture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes,</v>

938
01:03:07.561 --> 01:03:12.561
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see on my clients that they'll all of </v>

939
01:03:12.561 --> 01:03:12.660
<v Speaker 1>a sudden turn into a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>

940
01:03:12.661 --> 01:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like there'll be recounting some </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

941
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:17.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like fixation from a Freudian </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

942
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:22.310
<v Speaker 1>They'll be in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be describing some experience </v>

943
01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:24.330
<v Speaker 1>from the from the distant past and for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second there expression will approximate</v>

944
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.370
<v Speaker 1>who they were when they were six years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

945
01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:31.520
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really something remarkable to see </v>

946
01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.010
<v Speaker 1>and you can see these things if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really pay attention and then as they </v>

947
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.440
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

948
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching what's happening inside me </v>
<v Speaker 1>as I listened to their words and all </v>

949
01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:47.390
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll get an image or sometimes</v>

950
01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:52.391
<v Speaker 1>I'll get a memory of something we talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about before or sometimes I'll notice </v>

951
01:03:52.391 --> 01:03:56.871
<v Speaker 1>that what they're saying right now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than something they said five </v>

952
01:03:56.871 --> 01:03:56.940
<v Speaker 1>minutes ago and so then I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a sec.</v>

953
01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to understand what you're </v>

954
01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.470
<v Speaker 1>telling me and I noticed that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>said this and it seems to imply this,</v>

955
01:04:04.471 --> 01:04:05.700
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

956
01:04:05.701 --> 01:04:07.950
<v Speaker 1>a couple of minutes ago when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about that,</v>

957
01:04:07.951 --> 01:04:12.951
<v Speaker 1>then you said this and I don't see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two things are the same and I'm </v>

958
01:04:12.951 --> 01:04:16.491
<v Speaker 1>not doing that because I want them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rectify the paradox.</v>

959
01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:23.721
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing that because I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what they are saying and if </v>

960
01:04:23.721 --> 01:04:24.090
<v Speaker 1>someone says to you and then they say </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

961
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:29.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is for </v>

962
01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:30.420
<v Speaker 1>clarification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other direction than that.</v>

963
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:34.140
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a little image,</v>

964
01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:36.180
<v Speaker 1>like the sort of a fragment of a dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll say,</v>

965
01:04:36.181 --> 01:04:36.980
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

966
01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>what you just said when you said what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just said,</v>

967
01:04:39.691 --> 01:04:44.691
<v Speaker 1>this is what I experienced and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll talk for awhile about what </v>

968
01:04:44.691 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>that might mean and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll,</v>

969
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I can say to them what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

970
01:04:49.951 --> 01:04:54.951
<v Speaker 1>sometimes sometimes people will come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>my office and they do all sorts of </v>

971
01:04:54.951 --> 01:04:58.221
<v Speaker 1>strange things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had one client who had </v>

972
01:04:58.221 --> 01:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic epilepsy and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first times I saw her,</v>

973
01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:08.140
<v Speaker 1>she had a seizure in my office and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching her and it didn't really </v>

974
01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:11.420
<v Speaker 1>matter to me that she was having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>seizure.</v>

975
01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:15.140
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that's pretty weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>because normally when someone's having a</v>

976
01:05:15.141 --> 01:05:18.180
<v Speaker 1>seizure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you get affected</v>

977
01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:18.810
<v Speaker 1>by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

978
01:05:18.811 --> 01:05:23.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's sensations that emerge in your </v>

979
01:05:23.811 --> 01:05:25.890
<v Speaker 1>midsection and there's thoughts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency and,</v>

980
01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your body in some sense is </v>

981
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.201
<v Speaker 1>mimicking their body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what your body does all the </v>

982
01:05:33.201 --> 01:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>time when you're talking to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that produces a sense of urgency.</v>

983
01:05:34.151 --> 01:05:37.110
<v Speaker 1>And I just sort of watched her have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seizure and I thought,</v>

984
01:05:37.111 --> 01:05:38.340
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not real,</v>

985
01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:44.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not real seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was very good at it and you </v>

986
01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:44.070
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as she was concerned,</v>

987
01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:48.891
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't tell if the seizures were </v>
<v Speaker 1>real or not and sometimes if you have </v>

988
01:05:48.891 --> 01:05:52.371
<v Speaker 1>cycle genic epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had an epileptic seizure at one </v>

989
01:05:52.371 --> 01:05:53.040
<v Speaker 1>point that was genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

990
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:58.170
<v Speaker 1>it's exceptionally complicated and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not easy to develop a psychogenic </v>

991
01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:02.211
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had developed it and part of the</v>

992
01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>reason was</v>

993
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:10.620
<v Speaker 1>that she thought that she was toying </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea that existence as a </v>

994
01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:15.121
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric patient would require less </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort and responsibility and so she got</v>

995
01:06:15.431 --> 01:06:20.431
<v Speaker 1>tangled up at one point with one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental hospitals and they diagnosed her </v>

996
01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:22.630
<v Speaker 1>with paranoid schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not something I would recommend</v>

997
01:06:22.631 --> 01:06:27.631
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you don't actually have </v>

998
01:06:27.631 --> 01:06:27.631
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because once you've got the diagnosis,</v>

999
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.490
<v Speaker 1>well are you really going to know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1000
01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:31.710
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1001
01:06:31.711 --> 01:06:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a psychogenic epileptic seizure</v>

1002
01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:40.170
<v Speaker 1>in a variety of other symptoms there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequence of a very complex </v>

1003
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:46.710
<v Speaker 1>complex in union terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a secondary motivation and </v>

1004
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Freud in terms you go through with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole routine anyway,</v>

1005
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:53.410
<v Speaker 1>end up in a psych hospital and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>for experts and they tell you a paranoid</v>

1006
01:06:53.411 --> 01:06:58.411
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think you're going to not </v>

1007
01:06:58.411 --> 01:06:58.411
<v Speaker 1>believe that or at least 10 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you is going to believe it.</v>

1008
01:06:58.411 --> 01:07:03.370
<v Speaker 1>You're going to wonder after that and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>another 20 people tell you that and </v>

1009
01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:07.771
<v Speaker 1>you're put on medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could easily be that a year </v>

1010
01:07:07.771 --> 01:07:08.770
<v Speaker 1>later while you might still not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoid schizophrenia,</v>

1011
01:07:08.771 --> 01:07:10.450
<v Speaker 1>but you are not going to be doing very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1012
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:11.830
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1013
01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:19.930
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good example of what happens </v>

1014
01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:21.701
<v Speaker 1>when your self concept and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>organismic valuing systems aren't </v>

1015
01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:26.171
<v Speaker 1>working carefully in tandem anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So someone might be telling me a story </v>

1016
01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:28.770
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1017
01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:32.780
<v Speaker 1>like a story about something terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened to them and like I'll just</v>

1018
01:07:32.781 --> 01:07:37.520
<v Speaker 1>be sitting there like a brick wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not effecting me.</v>

1019
01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:39.020
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I'll tell people that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1020
01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1021
01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:45.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty terrible story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm having no emotional response to </v>

1022
01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any reason?</v>

1023
01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>You have any idea why that might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>while then maybe look,</v>

1024
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:54.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often people are very happy when you </v>

1025
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:54.250
<v Speaker 1>tell them that and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be unhappy with that.</v>

1026
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:58.691
<v Speaker 1>That's perfectly okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is now they know that </v>

1027
01:07:58.691 --> 01:08:00.440
<v Speaker 1>there's at least one person that they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicated with who's actually telling</v>

1028
01:08:00.441 --> 01:08:05.441
<v Speaker 1>them the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is actually not affected by their </v>

1029
01:08:05.441 --> 01:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>story because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone sits down beside you and they</v>

1030
01:08:08.121 --> 01:08:13.121
<v Speaker 1>tell you a terrible story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>

1031
01:08:13.121 --> 01:08:16.421
<v Speaker 1>tell them that that had no effect on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically zero because really rude </v>

1032
01:08:16.421 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 1>not to be negatively affected by someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's telling you a very sad story,</v>

1033
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>but if you're negatively effected by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just not true.</v>

1034
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:29.530
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing them any good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing is providing them with </v>

1035
01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:32.321
<v Speaker 1>evidence to maintain what could easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a delusion if they worked on it </v>

1036
01:08:32.321 --> 01:08:33.470
<v Speaker 1>long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By contrast,</v>

1037
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:38.471
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people will come into my </v>
<v Speaker 1>office and they'll tell me something </v>

1038
01:08:38.471 --> 01:08:42.131
<v Speaker 1>that just seems trivial and it made me </v>
<v Speaker 1>tear up so which means I can actually </v>

1039
01:08:42.861 --> 01:08:45.500
<v Speaker 1>feel emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would make me tear up,</v>

1040
01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:47.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's just something they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>barely.</v>

1041
01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:48.950
<v Speaker 1>They barely alluded to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1042
01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I got a client a while back told me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had had a session family session </v>

1043
01:08:54.681 --> 01:08:59.681
<v Speaker 1>where I had suggested to some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of this person's family that </v>

1044
01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:05.980
<v Speaker 1>things might go better for them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their child who was one of my clients,</v>

1045
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:12.820
<v Speaker 1>if for the next two weeks what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice doing was watching each other's</v>

1046
01:09:13.761 --> 01:09:18.761
<v Speaker 1>behavior during the day and finding one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that they could make a positive </v>

1047
01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:21.350
<v Speaker 1>comment about.</v>

1048
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't a game like if you play </v>

1049
01:09:26.530 --> 01:09:26.530
<v Speaker 1>it as a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it isn't going to work.</v>

1050
01:09:26.530 --> 01:09:31.120
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to do this properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you watch and then you </v>

1051
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.481
<v Speaker 1>notice when the person does something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually makes you feel positively </v>

1052
01:09:34.481 --> 01:09:36.890
<v Speaker 1>towards them and then you tell them you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did this.</v>

1053
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.320
<v Speaker 1>It has to be specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be at the end of the day.</v>

1054
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were pretty good today.</v>

1055
01:09:40.581 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1056
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:42.710
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1057
01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.110
<v Speaker 1>You have to notice something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually did.</v>

1058
01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.480
<v Speaker 1>It's usually something trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1059
01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:53.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate the fact that you </v>

1060
01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:57.910
<v Speaker 1>took your dirty dinner plate off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table and rinsed it off and put it in </v>

1061
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:58.130
<v Speaker 1>the dishwasher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1062
01:09:58.131 --> 01:10:00.710
<v Speaker 1>you think that's so damn trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly worth commenting on.</v>

1063
01:10:00.711 --> 01:10:01.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1064
01:10:01.161 --> 01:10:01.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1065
01:10:01.671 --> 01:10:06.671
<v Speaker 1>It's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the sort of specific </v>

1066
01:10:06.671 --> 01:10:06.671
<v Speaker 1>thing that you comment on.</v>

1067
01:10:06.671 --> 01:10:08.630
<v Speaker 1>If it did in fact make you happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1068
01:10:08.631 --> 01:10:10.280
<v Speaker 1>when you can think about that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral terms,</v>

1069
01:10:10.281 --> 01:10:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you,</v>

1070
01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:15.560
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want someone to do something that</v>

1071
01:10:15.561 --> 01:10:18.440
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should tell them when they do things</v>

1072
01:10:18.441 --> 01:10:21.230
<v Speaker 1>that you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they know what you like.</v>

1073
01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.960
<v Speaker 1>But of course that means that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting yourself on the line too,</v>

1074
01:10:23.961 --> 01:10:28.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if the person knows what you </v>

1075
01:10:28.961 --> 01:10:28.961
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can withhold it from you.</v>

1076
01:10:28.961 --> 01:10:29.300
<v Speaker 1>And so you're not going to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you trust them.</v>

1077
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.160
<v Speaker 1>You're really not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1078
01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:36.161
<v Speaker 1>you might be in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be in a marriage where never </v>

1079
01:10:36.161 --> 01:10:40.181
<v Speaker 1>once during the whole bloody marriage do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever tell the other person what </v>

1080
01:10:40.181 --> 01:10:40.181
<v Speaker 1>actually makes you happy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1081
01:10:40.181 --> 01:10:44.980
<v Speaker 1>that's stupid by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you want to have a really </v>

1082
01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:46.430
<v Speaker 1>miserable time of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an excellent way to start.</v>

1083
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:51.430
<v Speaker 1>You could also add to that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumption that if they really loved </v>

1084
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.430
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what you liked,</v>

1085
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:56.200
<v Speaker 1>which is also what your partners no </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than you generally speaking and </v>

1086
01:11:00.141 --> 01:11:02.180
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a clue what it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them happy.</v>

1087
01:11:02.181 --> 01:11:03.950
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know why you'd expect them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1088
01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:09.100
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you'd expect them to return the </v>

1089
01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.100
<v Speaker 1>favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you teach them,</v>

1090
01:11:10.101 --> 01:11:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like probably take four years.</v>

1091
01:11:12.141 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like I like when you do this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then of course they won't.</v>

1092
01:11:15.481 --> 01:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>So you might have to mention it again in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month.</v>

1093
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:22.461
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's going to take 18 months to </v>

1094
01:11:22.461 --> 01:11:22.461
<v Speaker 1>train this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least.</v>

1095
01:11:22.461 --> 01:11:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're smarter than a dog,</v>

1096
01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:27.000
<v Speaker 1>but not much smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be,</v>

1097
01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:32.060
<v Speaker 1>you have to use repetition and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be judicious about it and if you do </v>

1098
01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:33.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another person is also doing that to you</v>

1099
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:38.120
<v Speaker 1>and you both know that you're doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're both trying to make things </v>

1100
01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:38.880
<v Speaker 1>better than you're going to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1101
01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:40.740
<v Speaker 1>And then with any luck things will get </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

1102
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:43.530
<v Speaker 1>But that means you actually have to want</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to get better.</v>

1103
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

1104
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:52.221
<v Speaker 1>because not everybody wants things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get better and there's a part of </v>

1105
01:11:52.221 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>everyone that would be just as happy if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't get better.</v>

1106
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.630
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

1107
01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Roger's idea is that if you communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly with the person that you're in </v>

1108
01:12:03.321 --> 01:12:08.321
<v Speaker 1>the relationship with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can model proper being in some </v>

1109
01:12:08.321 --> 01:12:12.491
<v Speaker 1>sense and that at least you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt tomorrow and then as you </v>

1110
01:12:12.491 --> 01:12:16.151
<v Speaker 1>attempted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get better and better at it and </v>

1111
01:12:16.151 --> 01:12:16.151
<v Speaker 1>as you get better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other person will get better at it.</v>

1112
01:12:16.151 --> 01:12:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And that works too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a client who was very anxious </v>

1113
01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:22.760
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the person first came to see me,</v>

1114
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.500
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't even talk on the phone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're doing,</v>

1115
01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.550
<v Speaker 1>they're acting publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're acting in public.</v>

1116
01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:35.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's been the consequence of about</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years of,</v>

1117
01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I would say Rogerian conversations were </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all that I did was listen now the</v>

1118
01:12:44.091 --> 01:12:49.091
<v Speaker 1>UNCW,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't quite get the unconditional </v>

1119
01:12:49.091 --> 01:12:51.671
<v Speaker 1>positive regard thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I know why Roger is set it and </v>

1120
01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:55.181
<v Speaker 1>his idea that arbitrary conditions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth can make someone pathological or </v>

1121
01:12:55.181 --> 01:12:56.150
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1122
01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I think a more nuanced sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconditional positive regard is what </v>

1123
01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:06.331
<v Speaker 1>happens when you watch the person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you something and as they're </v>

1124
01:13:06.331 --> 01:13:09.151
<v Speaker 1>telling it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see a little part of them sort </v>

1125
01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:12.241
<v Speaker 1>of come alive and that often happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>when their face loses a fair bit of its </v>

1126
01:13:12.241 --> 01:13:17.191
<v Speaker 1>rigidity and you can see more of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like when they were a child </v>

1127
01:13:17.191 --> 01:13:18.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of peeping through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their face sort of opens up.</v>

1128
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:21.370
<v Speaker 1>You can they a hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really good for that person.</v>

1129
01:13:21.371 --> 01:13:26.371
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they been telling me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be doing that was right on the </v>

1130
01:13:26.371 --> 01:13:26.371
<v Speaker 1>right track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can say,</v>

1131
01:13:26.371 --> 01:13:27.610
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that when you talk about this,</v>

1132
01:13:27.611 --> 01:13:29.830
<v Speaker 1>you know your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your face redox,</v>

1133
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>you didn't look as anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were smiling,</v>

1134
01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a genuine smile.</v>

1135
01:13:33.671 --> 01:13:38.671
<v Speaker 1>And for like a second or two there you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like you were doing well and you </v>

1136
01:13:38.671 --> 01:13:38.671
<v Speaker 1>were happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1137
01:13:38.671 --> 01:13:41.170
<v Speaker 1>let's do a bunch more of that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1138
01:13:41.171 --> 01:13:44.260
<v Speaker 1>if you see in someone that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of experiencing that,</v>

1139
01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.040
<v Speaker 1>then you could help them experience that</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

1140
01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:51.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's the purpose of a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship</v>

1141
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:53.570
<v Speaker 2>is that</v>

1142
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:58.790
<v Speaker 1>you have your weaknesses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequacies and you can't think them,</v>

1143
01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:02.720
<v Speaker 1>think yourself out of them by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because they colored the way that</v>

1144
01:14:02.721 --> 01:14:07.721
<v Speaker 1>you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need somebody else to bang </v>

1145
01:14:07.721 --> 01:14:09.410
<v Speaker 1>yourself up against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to contend with so that all the knots in</v>

1146
01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 1>your soul can get ironed out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical.</v>

1147
01:14:11.741 --> 01:14:13.750
<v Speaker 1>You're doing the same thing for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other person.</v>

1148
01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:16.000
<v Speaker 1>And then both of you are on an upward </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiral.</v>

1149
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:21.010
<v Speaker 1>And then in some sense that's the core </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory of Rogerian psychotherapy.</v>

1150
01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like genuine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest communication can heal people and</v>

1151
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.540
<v Speaker 1>genuinely dishonest communication can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make them pathological.</v>

1152
01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:36.541
<v Speaker 1>And in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Roger's got closer to the truth.</v>

1153
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:44.310
<v Speaker 1>If you invert Rogers presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's as close to the truth as any </v>

1154
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.740
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapists has gone to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes people pathological.</v>

1155
01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of,</v>

1156
01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:56.041
<v Speaker 1>and you'll notice this as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what you're doing in </v>

1157
01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:56.800
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy and in any genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is a moral endeavor.</v>

1158
01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:02.640
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the other person is deceiving </v>

1159
01:15:03.341 --> 01:15:08.341
<v Speaker 1>themselves or lying or failing to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of things that they should become </v>

1160
01:15:08.341 --> 01:15:12.271
<v Speaker 1>aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get bent and twisted </v>

1161
01:15:12.271 --> 01:15:12.271
<v Speaker 1>out of shape and then they're not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be congruent,</v>

1162
01:15:12.271 --> 01:15:14.920
<v Speaker 1>congruent with their body or with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>broader world.</v>

1163
01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.010
<v Speaker 1>And then they're going to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that will cascade.</v>

1164
01:15:18.011 --> 01:15:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Then all sorts of things will start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

1165
01:15:19.611 --> 01:15:24.611
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the path to perdition and an </v>

1166
01:15:24.611 --> 01:15:24.611
<v Speaker 1>involuntary trip to the underworld.</v>

1167
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:31.350
<v Speaker 1>When we meet again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'll show you a little clip of </v>

1168
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Rogerian psychotherapy because a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 fifties agreed to be filmed,</v>

1169
01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.580
<v Speaker 1>which had a dramatic effect on her life </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

1170
01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:37.500
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1171
01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:38.710
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it presented,</v>

1172
01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.720
<v Speaker 1>provides a nice real world illustration </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what Rogers is doing when he's trying</v>

1173
01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:45.760
<v Speaker 1>to listen.</v>
