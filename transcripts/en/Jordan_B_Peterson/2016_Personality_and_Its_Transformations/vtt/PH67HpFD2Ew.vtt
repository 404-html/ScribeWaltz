1
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.960
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.650
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of things I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you about today.</v>

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Many things I want to tell you about.</v>

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

5
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 2>give you a Schema that's going to enable</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to understand.</v>

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it'll enable you to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories like the one I told you last </v>

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember Jonah and the whale.</v>

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I want to provide you with this Schema </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you can understand stories like </v>

9
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many,</v>

10
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 2>many more stories like that and partly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm telling you about today in some</v>

11
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 2>sense our archetypes and there's a and </v>
<v Speaker 2>an archetype is isn't.</v>

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 2>It's an idea that was made most popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last hundred years by Carl </v>

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a much older idea than that.</v>

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 2>It's really a platonic ideas and in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

15
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 2>and it means it means something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental pattern.</v>

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 2>And so an architect can manifest itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>in different ways.</v>

17
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 2>It could be a pattern of emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

18
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 2>So that could be something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

19
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 2>It could be the way that that emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>response displays itself on your body,</v>

20
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 2>on your face.</v>

21
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Speaker 2>It could be the way that that emotion </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fields and displays itself on your </v>

22
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:19.551
<v Speaker 2>face and then plays itself out as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>drama in your local environment,</v>

23
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 2>so like an angry argument is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>archetypal phenomenon and the reason </v>

24
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 2>this architectural is because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

25
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 2>you have one them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have them,</v>

26
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 2>you have them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have them,</v>

27
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 2>everyone has them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you can't really think about them</v>

28
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:39.351
<v Speaker 2>as individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to think about them as </v>

29
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 2>universal and you can't think about them</v>
<v Speaker 2>as something that you create in a sense,</v>

30
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:45.381
<v Speaker 2>although in a sense you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also as something that happens to </v>

31
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:49.371
<v Speaker 2>you now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you read about young and </v>

32
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 2>archetypes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite confusing because you can </v>

33
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 2>never be sure whether he's talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>an instinct and emotion,</v>

34
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 2>a motivational system or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>subpersonality or the subpersonality </v>

35
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.820
<v Speaker 2>within which those things manifest </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself or even the social drama that's </v>

36
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 2>being played out in time and space in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social world.</v>

37
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 2>But our real archetype,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say is all of those things.</v>

38
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:13.821
<v Speaker 2>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we use archetipal means of </v>

39
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:17.721
<v Speaker 2>expression to represent how we act and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the same thing as resent </v>

40
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 2>representing what the world is made out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

41
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a very different thing and so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could say in some sense,</v>

42
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 2>we tell stories and understand stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that we can figure out how people act</v>

43
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:31.731
<v Speaker 2>and how they should act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we conduct science so that we </v>

44
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:34.641
<v Speaker 2>can figure out what the world's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a material objective perspective </v>

45
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 2>and the two things coexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uneasily,</v>

46
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.870
<v Speaker 2>I think the more primary form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge is actually how to act with </v>

47
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 2>the scientific model nested inside it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the most important question that</v>

48
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 2>you have to solve as a living organism </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't what the world is made out of.</v>

49
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 2>It's how you should act in the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>safe from a Darwinian perspective even </v>

50
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 2>so that you can live long enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduce.</v>

51
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 2>That's basically from a strict </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological perspective.</v>

52
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:04.621
<v Speaker 2>In some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you have to do in order to </v>

53
00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 2>be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of obvious,</v>

54
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:09.871
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not very successful if </v>

55
00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 2>you just go and die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then of course deaths from a genetic</v>

56
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>perspective and failing to leave </v>
<v Speaker 2>offspring are much the same thing,</v>

57
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.530
<v Speaker 2>so now one of the questions might be how</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it that we conceive of the world as a</v>

58
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 2>place to act in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly,</v>

59
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to outline a hypothesis for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and then explain the significance of</v>

60
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:38.341
<v Speaker 2>that hypothesis and the hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 2>involves the description of what you </v>

61
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:43.021
<v Speaker 2>might consider constituent elements and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also transformation processes.</v>

62
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as far as I can tell,</v>

63
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 2>the constituent elements of the stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we tell about how people acted </v>

64
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 2>should act our characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that makes sense,</v>

65
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you really can't have a drama or</v>

66
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 2>a story with characters.</v>

67
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is the characters have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be understandable and so for them to be </v>

68
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 2>understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sort of have to be like you or they</v>

69
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 2>have to be like someone that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have to be human.</v>

70
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.250
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly that they're human </v>

71
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.621
<v Speaker 2>because even when you're telling a story</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what happened to you today,</v>

72
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to think about what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

73
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 2>So someone might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

74
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 2>how was your day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

75
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe that's the lowest level,</v>

76
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 2>lowest resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highest abstract story.</v>

77
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 2>My Day was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty boring story.</v>

78
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.820
<v Speaker 2>It's better than terrible I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not interesting and it's not </v>

79
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.181
<v Speaker 2>detailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But first and gets the notion that </v>

80
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:45.180
<v Speaker 2>things went according to what according </v>
<v Speaker 2>to plan or more specifically the things </v>

81
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.861
<v Speaker 2>unfolded the way you wanted them to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>not exactly the same as according to </v>

82
00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 2>plan because a plan is kind of a cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive thing,</v>

83
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or or,</v>

84
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 2>or expected expectation.</v>

85
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 2>The cognitive scientists sort of used </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether,</v>

86
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.250
<v Speaker 2>well while what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you wanted them to implies that you </v>

87
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 2>have desires and emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivations and that they inform the way</v>

88
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 2>that you're acting in the world because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't just act in the world.</v>

89
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 2>You Act in the world so that you tried </v>
<v Speaker 2>to turn it into something better than it</v>

90
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 2>is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assuming you have any sense,</v>

91
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because some people act on the world to </v>

92
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.351
<v Speaker 2>make it worse than it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to forget about those </v>

93
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 2>people for now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say fine to someone,</v>

94
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 2>you basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

95
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I got what I wanted today without undue </v>
<v Speaker 2>hassle.</v>

96
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a really condensed version of </v>

97
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 2>the events of the day and it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very good story,</v>

98
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 2>although it might suffice for casual </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

99
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Person might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

100
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:43.800
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

101
00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 2>what did you do today?</v>

102
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

103
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I woke up this morning and I went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>university and uh,</v>

104
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:56.521
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the subway took a lot longer than it </v>

105
00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:56.521
<v Speaker 2>usually does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

106
00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used that time to do some studying and</v>

107
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.040
<v Speaker 2>then I got to school and I particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't lecture,</v>

108
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 2>but lunch was really good and I met some</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

109
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 2>And so that's kind of a story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

110
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:10.571
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person that you're talking to might </v>

111
00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:13.440
<v Speaker 2>listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a particularly compelling </v>

112
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably better than fine.</v>

113
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

114
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 2>why did you select those elements to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about?</v>

115
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't talk about how many times you</v>

116
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:26.051
<v Speaker 2>blink your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first minute that you woke up and </v>

117
00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:29.291
<v Speaker 2>you didn't describe the motor movements </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you used to put your left leg on </v>

118
00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 2>the floor and you didn't describe.</v>

119
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 2>You know what bowl you used for </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakfast,</v>

120
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 2>and the reason you didn't do that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because a,</v>

121
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't remember for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and B,</v>

122
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 2>you don't care and neither does your </v>
<v Speaker 2>listener,</v>

123
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:45.911
<v Speaker 2>but that's the peculiar things that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>listener is going to care about some </v>

124
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 2>things and not care about other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're a good storyteller,</v>

125
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.380
<v Speaker 2>you kind of automatically know which of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things that you should talk about </v>

126
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 2>so that you're interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which of the things you should ignore so</v>

127
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:57.500
<v Speaker 2>that you're not boring your listener to </v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

128
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.020
<v Speaker 2>And you also understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will also understand that.</v>

129
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.280
<v Speaker 2>And but you don't know how you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you know is that you're trying to </v>

130
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 2>tell an interesting story and in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense what you're doing is you're trying</v>

131
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:14.051
<v Speaker 2>to reduce a sequence of actions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceptions of exceptional complexity to</v>

132
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 2>the just right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like the essential or the moral</v>

133
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:22.571
<v Speaker 2>in some sense and you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>convey that and the other person is </v>

134
00:07:22.571 --> 00:07:25.781
<v Speaker 2>listening partly because they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicate that they care for you and </v>

135
00:07:25.781 --> 00:07:25.781
<v Speaker 2>would like to know.</v>

136
00:07:25.781 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 2>They want to stay caught up with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ongoing narrative so that they </v>

137
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.401
<v Speaker 2>understand you and maybe also because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they might think that they'll gardener </v>

138
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:37.061
<v Speaker 2>some bit of information factual or </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral that might aid them in some </v>

139
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

140
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:43.061
<v Speaker 2>so and we're doing that to each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time and we automatically do </v>

141
00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:46.241
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We automatically know how to tell </v>

142
00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:47.891
<v Speaker 2>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what I'm saying is that even the </v>

143
00:07:47.891 --> 00:07:50.201
<v Speaker 2>person that you describe when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe yourself to someone else isn't </v>

144
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:54.521
<v Speaker 2>exactly you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some representation of you as a </v>

145
00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:58.130
<v Speaker 2>sort of generic human being that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>about doing certain kinds of interesting</v>

146
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 2>things in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or here's a way of thinking about it.</v>

147
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:05.951
<v Speaker 2>Roughly is that you make yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero of your own story and so you kind </v>

148
00:08:06.711 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 2>of know that because when you go to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie and movies are usually romances,</v>

149
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.750
<v Speaker 2>say or hero stories will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>romances or adventures or both roughly </v>

150
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:15.750
<v Speaker 2>speaking.</v>

151
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

152
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:21.770
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they turn out well and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a comedy and sometimes they don't turn </v>

153
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.480
<v Speaker 2>out so well and that's a tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you go there,</v>

154
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.170
<v Speaker 2>what you basically see is a story about </v>
<v Speaker 2>another person who sort of like you,</v>

155
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.260
<v Speaker 2>who's the hero and what you do is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>track them through a sequence of </v>

156
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.501
<v Speaker 2>adventures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually what you track them through </v>

157
00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:38.681
<v Speaker 2>isn't things were good and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed good and then at the end they </v>

158
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 2>were still the same as they were at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

159
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 2>And good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 2>because why do you want to watch that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

161
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 2>well you should because isn't that </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasant?</v>

162
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:51.731
<v Speaker 2>The person's happy and then they stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy and then they end happy and </v>

163
00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:51.731
<v Speaker 2>everyone's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why.</v>

164
00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't.</v>

165
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 2>And really what want to see is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>either see,</v>

166
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you want to see someone get into trouble</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fail in a spectacularly interesting </v>

167
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.531
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you want to see someone get into </v>

168
00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 2>trouble and then overcome it in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacularly interesting way.</v>

169
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.920
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this idea in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the story that the person has to </v>

170
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:17.961
<v Speaker 2>undergo some kind of transformation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the midst of their travails and efforts </v>

171
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.080
<v Speaker 2>in order for it to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have to start in one place.</v>

172
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.870
<v Speaker 2>They have to end up somewhere that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>so good in a very,</v>

173
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:29.871
<v Speaker 2>very complicated way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe by transforming their </v>

174
00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by transforming the surroundings are but</v>

175
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 2>coming to some sort of realization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe just by dimwitted luck,</v>

176
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:40.370
<v Speaker 2>they managed to solve the set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems that emerge triumphant at the </v>

177
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 2>other end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

178
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 2>So that's the meaning of Jonah and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whale,</v>

179
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.400
<v Speaker 2>or you remember what happens to Jonah is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's got this destiny he supposed </v>

180
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 2>to be pursuing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any decides that it's too much trouble.</v>

181
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not unsurprisingly,</v>

182
00:09:55.171 --> 00:10:00.171
<v Speaker 2>because if you remember what he was told</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do was go to tell a whole city that </v>

183
00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:01.950
<v Speaker 2>they were misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assuming rightly as he did,</v>

184
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:06.951
<v Speaker 2>that that would not make him pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly popular and maybe he'd get </v>

185
00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 2>killed and even if he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be extraordinarily difficult.</v>

186
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 2>He thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no damn way I'm doing that.</v>

187
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:16.011
<v Speaker 2>So he denied his destiny and as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence he fell into the abyss and </v>

188
00:10:16.011 --> 00:10:16.950
<v Speaker 2>was swallowed up,</v>

189
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.930
<v Speaker 2>and then because he repented and decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>to carry on with what he was to carry on</v>

190
00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:27.931
<v Speaker 2>with his responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the creature of the abyss spitting back </v>

191
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:29.440
<v Speaker 2>up and he got to go along his merry way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>

192
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:34.441
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that has ever happened to </v>

193
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:34.441
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's wrong.</v>

194
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Things like that happen to you all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and you know it.</v>

195
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.210
<v Speaker 2>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

196
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 2>here's a couple of examples and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to draw all sorts of examples </v>

197
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.580
<v Speaker 2>from your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the story of betrayal.</v>

198
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.480
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe in one of your relatively </v>

199
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.420
<v Speaker 2>uninformed</v>

200
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.470
<v Speaker 2>flurries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ended up establishing a relationship</v>

201
00:10:57.471 --> 00:10:59.360
<v Speaker 2>with someone who was really not good for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

202
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.440
<v Speaker 2>And that might mean while they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a bad personality match or </v>

203
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.740
<v Speaker 2>it might mean they really weren't good </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you because you know,</v>

204
00:11:06.741 --> 00:11:11.741
<v Speaker 2>you could get pretty unlucky and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get tangled up with someone who's very </v>

205
00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:15.101
<v Speaker 2>deceitful and very malevolent and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>could care less about your maybe who </v>

206
00:11:15.101 --> 00:11:18.521
<v Speaker 2>even wants to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you can establish a trusting </v>

207
00:11:18.521 --> 00:11:18.890
<v Speaker 2>relationship with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or at least you trust them.</v>

208
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:23.891
<v Speaker 2>And then one day you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find out that they are not who they </v>

209
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:24.770
<v Speaker 2>said they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or even more importantly,</v>

210
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:29.771
<v Speaker 2>they are not who you thought they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then maybe you're in a committed </v>

211
00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:32.150
<v Speaker 2>relationship and they'd be trained you </v>
<v Speaker 2>with someone else.</v>

212
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.590
<v Speaker 2>And so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

213
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.450
<v Speaker 2>there you are at home and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:41.470
<v Speaker 2>you're perfectly happy about being at </v>
<v Speaker 2>home and then your partner comes home </v>

215
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.171
<v Speaker 2>and for one reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find out that they're having an </v>

216
00:11:44.171 --> 00:11:45.290
<v Speaker 2>affair or that they'd be trained you or </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they'd lied to you.</v>

217
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.180
<v Speaker 2>And some other spectacularly important </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

218
00:11:47.181 --> 00:11:49.280
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it's a lover and maybe it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>family member.</v>

219
00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's assembling and maybe it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend,</v>

220
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter,</v>

221
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 2>and so here's the way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

222
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.600
<v Speaker 2>The minute before they come home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in one place and you remember </v>

223
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 2>places just to place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

224
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.360
<v Speaker 2>A place is a place in time because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in space time.</v>

225
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 2>We live in time and place and what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means is you can be in the same place in</v>

226
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:16.321
<v Speaker 2>one minute and a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 2>place in the next minute even if you </v>

227
00:12:16.321 --> 00:12:19.621
<v Speaker 2>haven't even moved and so places a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very complicated idea,</v>

228
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:25.140
<v Speaker 2>so you're sitting at home and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching oprah and you're perfectly </v>

229
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.161
<v Speaker 2>content to do that and then the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes home and the bottom of your world </v>

230
00:12:29.161 --> 00:12:32.731
<v Speaker 2>falls out and then all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not where you thought you were </v>

231
00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:32.731
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

232
00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:35.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a really weird place that you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>now because it's not where you were.</v>

233
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.560
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also don't know where it is </v>

234
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.650
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know who that person </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

235
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:46.651
<v Speaker 2>That's in that room with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what your past with them </v>

236
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:48.940
<v Speaker 2>was or what it meant or anything else </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

237
00:12:48.941 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Because it was predicated on absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>misperceptions,</v>

238
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:57.270
<v Speaker 2>so none of your memories about those </v>
<v Speaker 2>events are valid even though you have </v>

239
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.860
<v Speaker 2>them as memories and then you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>worst problem,</v>

240
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:01.630
<v Speaker 2>which is if you're betrayed badly </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

241
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.680
<v Speaker 2>not only are you not going to understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>your immediate past with that person,</v>

242
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

243
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:11.521
<v Speaker 2>your future is also gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big problem as is your </v>

244
00:13:11.521 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 2>presence has become radically more </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex,</v>

245
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.060
<v Speaker 2>but it's worse than that because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really betrayed,</v>

246
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.510
<v Speaker 2>you're also going to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who am I that I could be that stupid?</v>

247
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.840
<v Speaker 2>And then you're going to think what is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>human being that they can be that </v>

248
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.441
<v Speaker 2>corrupt and so not only has the have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentals being kicked out of the </v>

249
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:34.411
<v Speaker 2>substructure of your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your notion of what it means to be </v>

250
00:13:34.411 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 2>you and what it needs to be human </v>
<v Speaker 2>might've been seriously disrupted.</v>

251
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 2>And you know the thing about that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a non trivial event.</v>

252
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.690
<v Speaker 2>People call that traumatic it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like and it's like a physical wound and </v>

253
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 2>in fact it has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly if the trauma is great enough,</v>

254
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 2>it can produce a psychophysiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>wound because that sort of trauma,</v>

255
00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:58.450
<v Speaker 2>a deep betrayal is a good example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will damage your brain and maybe you'll </v>

256
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.611
<v Speaker 2>recover from it and maybe you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the ways that that's been </v>

257
00:14:02.611 --> 00:14:07.081
<v Speaker 2>represented forever in mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories is by being swallowed up by a </v>

258
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:12.301
<v Speaker 2>subterranean beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that comes up from the </v>

259
00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 2>depths and pulls you down and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in it.</v>

260
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Now why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

261
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.050
<v Speaker 2>that's an extraordinarily complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

262
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 2>but here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the answer.</v>

263
00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:27.421
<v Speaker 2>As nearly as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we evolved a very complicated </v>

264
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:31.000
<v Speaker 2>neuro-psychological system to signal </v>
<v Speaker 2>alarm.</v>

265
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>threat,</v>

266
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.450
<v Speaker 2>threat sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

267
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 2>And that makes us freeze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

268
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at how an animal uses </v>
<v Speaker 2>that system,</v>

269
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:42.490
<v Speaker 2>let's say a mammal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to keep it simple because we're all</v>

270
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:44.560
<v Speaker 2>mammals and so we can kind of understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals.</v>

271
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.710
<v Speaker 2>So if a rabbit sees a wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

272
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 2>it's going to freeze so that the wolf </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp c and if I,</v>

273
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.860
<v Speaker 2>if a rat smells like cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it has never smelled a cat and </v>

274
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 2>it's whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to also freeze.</v>

275
00:14:56.661 --> 00:15:01.661
<v Speaker 2>And interestingly with rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you put rats in a natural </v>

276
00:15:01.661 --> 00:15:06.401
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means they get to help little rat </v>

277
00:15:06.401 --> 00:15:08.470
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little rap families and they're not </v>

278
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.470
<v Speaker 2>like little white rats alone in a cage.</v>

279
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 2>They're happy family rats and they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got their burrows and they live in their</v>

280
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:17.021
<v Speaker 2>little societies that maybe there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of their territory where they can </v>

281
00:15:17.021 --> 00:15:20.981
<v Speaker 2>go get food and they're used to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they'll scurry out there in the day </v>

282
00:15:20.981 --> 00:15:21.550
<v Speaker 2>kind of hiding because they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>

283
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they'll scurry out at night </v>
<v Speaker 2>because rats are night things and </v>

284
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 2>they'll get their food and they'll eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>it or bring it back or whatever they,</v>

285
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.380
<v Speaker 2>whatever they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>share it with their family or at least </v>

286
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:32.380
<v Speaker 2>bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

287
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.161
<v Speaker 2>let's say that you put a cat out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you even just put a cap there </v>

288
00:15:36.161 --> 00:15:37.310
<v Speaker 2>and take it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that the place smells like cat.</v>

289
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if one of those rats goes out there and </v>

290
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:42.340
<v Speaker 2>sees that cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all it's going to freeze and it</v>

291
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:47.080
<v Speaker 2>is not a happy thing because imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a rat and a thing that's four </v>

292
00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 2>times as big as a lion suddenly appears </v>
<v Speaker 2>on your front yard.</v>

293
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's rough,</v>

294
00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:52.850
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to phrase it,</v>

295
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to go hide downstairs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what are you going to do?</v>

296
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a rat,</v>

297
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.720
<v Speaker 2>you're going to screen for 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is nonstop with your little beak </v>

298
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.130
<v Speaker 2>poking out of your borough so everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>can hear you scream.</v>

299
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's the same given the length of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life as you're screaming nonstop for two</v>

300
00:16:08.511 --> 00:16:10.160
<v Speaker 2>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like that,</v>

301
00:16:10.161 --> 00:16:15.161
<v Speaker 2>racks nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not happy about the whole cap </v>

302
00:16:15.161 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe maybe if no more cat odor</v>

303
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:21.461
<v Speaker 2>happens by and no hypervigilant rat see </v>
<v Speaker 2>any more cats than after it screens for </v>

304
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.680
<v Speaker 2>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts to calm down a little bit and </v>

305
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.530
<v Speaker 2>maybe then it starts to remember that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hungry and that you know,</v>

306
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:30.650
<v Speaker 2>there's things to attend to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then maybe it very,</v>

307
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 2>very carefully goes back out where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was foraging for food,</v>

308
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:39.251
<v Speaker 2>sort of crunched over and hypervigilant </v>
<v Speaker 2>to not moving very much in case that </v>

309
00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 2>damn cats around.</v>

310
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 2>And then maybe slowly it regains control</v>
<v Speaker 2>over its territory.</v>

311
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:48.700
<v Speaker 2>It runs back and forth trying to ensure </v>
<v Speaker 2>that none of that place that used to be </v>

312
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.960
<v Speaker 2>safe has gone troublesome cats </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with it anymore.</v>

313
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.290
<v Speaker 2>And so in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom fell out of that rats life.</v>

314
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is the rat has predator </v>
<v Speaker 2>detection systems that are associated </v>

315
00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 2>with extreme anxiety and escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're automatically activated whenever</v>

316
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 2>there's a Predator in sight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have those systems too.</v>

317
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 2>But human beings are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

318
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

319
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.180
<v Speaker 2>rats have predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies.</v>

320
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Humans have predators and enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

321
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:19.580
<v Speaker 2>So then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

322
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 2>what's a human predator slash enemy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

323
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.960
<v Speaker 2>it depends on how long a period of time </v>
<v Speaker 2>over which you wish to calculate what </v>

324
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 2>constitutes human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we know,</v>

325
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:33.260
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that $60 million years ago,</v>

326
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.000
<v Speaker 2>your primary Predator when you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>wandering around in trees and we're only</v>

327
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.980
<v Speaker 2>about this big with stakes and so snake </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a Predator and an enemy and you know,</v>

328
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:47.981
<v Speaker 2>you guys can easily learn how to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of snakes and maybe you're </v>

329
00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:47.981
<v Speaker 2>innately afraid of them to begin with.</v>

330
00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:52.870
<v Speaker 2>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The science on that is not exactly </v>

331
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.920
<v Speaker 2>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it certainly indicates that you</v>

332
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:57.921
<v Speaker 2>could easily learn snake fear and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably indicates that really it's a </v>

333
00:17:57.921 --> 00:17:58.470
<v Speaker 2>neat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an eight inch chimpanzees.</v>

334
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 2>So why not us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

335
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:05.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not that long since we split off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary pathway from the common</v>

336
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 2>chip human ancestor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So enemies,</v>

337
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:08.730
<v Speaker 2>snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

338
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:13.790
<v Speaker 2>How about crocodiles?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things pulled a lot of your </v>

339
00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:13.790
<v Speaker 2>ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

340
00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.000
<v Speaker 2>not your ancestors because they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled under water.</v>

341
00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:20.001
<v Speaker 2>But when we were wondering around on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>African Veldt and we went down to the </v>

342
00:18:20.001 --> 00:18:21.630
<v Speaker 2>river to have some water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be sure that a fair number of us</v>

343
00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:25.900
<v Speaker 2>got pulled underneath by crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so crocodiles and you know,</v>

344
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.720
<v Speaker 2>those are creepy things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crocodiles.</v>

345
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be.</v>

346
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.440
<v Speaker 2>They figure it nightmares and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure in horror movies and you can </v>

347
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.680
<v Speaker 2>imagine yourself in Florida now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there with alligators and thinking,</v>

348
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be just as well if they didn't come</v>

349
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:42.411
<v Speaker 2>too close to your boat with their little</v>
<v Speaker 2>beady eyes and they're great big teeth </v>

350
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:42.411
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 2>they're unpleasant things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's lions,</v>

352
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.890
<v Speaker 2>hyenas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

353
00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Another one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might take a lion in a Hyena or </v>

354
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:51.910
<v Speaker 2>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>

355
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 2>I would say they're large tooth </v>
<v Speaker 2>mammalian carnivores.</v>

356
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.710
<v Speaker 2>It's like a medic category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they sort of fit in that Predator</v>

357
00:18:58.711 --> 00:19:03.711
<v Speaker 2>enemy category and your nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 2>is prepared to respond to predatory eyes</v>

358
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:09.110
<v Speaker 2>and teeth and no wonder because </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory eyes track you down at teeth </v>

359
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.831
<v Speaker 2>eat you and they bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a good thing that you're </v>

360
00:19:12.831 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 2>aware of those and that you can detect </v>
<v Speaker 2>them rapidly.</v>

361
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

362
00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.940
<v Speaker 2>what else is a human enemy?</v>

363
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 2>How about another human?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would that be?</v>

364
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.580
<v Speaker 2>You think more people have died from </v>
<v Speaker 2>other humans are from predators?</v>

365
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that since we've actually been</v>

366
00:19:34.111 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's maybe 150,000</v>

367
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:41.511
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's about when it appears </v>

368
00:19:41.511 --> 00:19:41.511
<v Speaker 2>that we were more or less genetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>identical to what we are now.</v>

369
00:19:41.511 --> 00:19:44.370
<v Speaker 2>My guess is that humans have got it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over predators.</v>

370
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean lots of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God eat and let's not be too shy about </v>

371
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.360
<v Speaker 2>discussing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now at least man,</v>

372
00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 2>it's other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

373
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:55.380
<v Speaker 2>well what about yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about you as your own enemy?</v>

374
00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:56.980
<v Speaker 2>While?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

375
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.530
<v Speaker 2>then you make it psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's not other people may,</v>

376
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's the evil in their hearts or </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's the evil in your hearts.</v>

377
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.040
<v Speaker 2>So you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a way of thinking about it,</v>

378
00:20:07.041 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 2>is that we have a circuit to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>threats,</v>

379
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 2>but the threats exist all the way from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the primordial biological,</v>

380
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:15.450
<v Speaker 2>like actual predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes,</v>

381
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.940
<v Speaker 2>all the way up to the incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract.</v>

382
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Like my great enemy is the evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentions that other people harbored </v>

383
00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.970
<v Speaker 2>towards me or that maybe I have in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>own heart.</v>

384
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:29.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's that entire complex of </v>

385
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.330
<v Speaker 2>predatory slash threat slash evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's become psychologize to that</v>

386
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:37.761
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that can be a </v>

387
00:20:37.761 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 2>character in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is right.</v>

388
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 2>It's the antagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the adversary that's the,</v>

389
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.400
<v Speaker 2>that's the architectural element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing that opposes you in every</v>

390
00:20:44.401 --> 00:20:47.320
<v Speaker 2>way and you can locate that in all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of different places,</v>

391
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have a story about how someone</v>

392
00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:52.700
<v Speaker 2>is grappling with their own evil </v>
<v Speaker 2>impulses up.</v>

393
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.210
<v Speaker 2>What's the name of that serial killer </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>

394
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm Dexter Dexter's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got that problem.</v>

395
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:00.880
<v Speaker 2>People are pretty fascinated by that </v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

396
00:21:00.881 --> 00:21:03.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A serial killer who can do good,</v>

397
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.980
<v Speaker 2>like sort of like a human being in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

398
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:07.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>

399
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:12.530
<v Speaker 2>There's golf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this psychological barrier between good </v>

400
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.030
<v Speaker 2>and evil in his heart or maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the,</v>

401
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.630
<v Speaker 2>the enemy is externalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe it's Batman and the joker and </v>

402
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.170
<v Speaker 2>the joker is a pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The is really a figure of,</v>

403
00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.210
<v Speaker 2>of chaotic evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally,</v>

404
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Best Batman movie,</v>

405
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.360
<v Speaker 2>which was the one with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the joker.</v>

406
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.300
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't Jack Nicholson who played </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ledger ledger.</v>

407
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

408
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Heath Ledger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

409
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 2>that was rough on old heath and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder,</v>

410
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:40.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he embodied this archetypal </v>

411
00:21:40.201 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 2>character and that joker was so much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>an adversary that he didn't even want to</v>

412
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:43.090
<v Speaker 2>win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

413
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:44.900
<v Speaker 2>You can understand adversaries that want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

414
00:21:44.901 --> 00:21:48.520
<v Speaker 2>when its adversaries that want to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone lose,</v>

415
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:51.520
<v Speaker 2>that are really hard to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of what made that movie,</v>

416
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively striking and memorable.</v>

417
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:55.780
<v Speaker 2>And he really embodied that character </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

418
00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:01.220
<v Speaker 2>And so one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's two sets of characters that make </v>

419
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:01.720
<v Speaker 2>up stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hero and address Siri,</v>

420
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:03.250
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

421
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.840
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can,</v>

422
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.750
<v Speaker 2>you can understand that at multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>levels simultaneously.</v>

423
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's another set of characters.</v>

424
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's why I think these characters are </v>

425
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 2>fundamental elements of our cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure caught cognitive substructure.</v>

426
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that really what we want to know</v>

427
00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:23.410
<v Speaker 2>is not what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we want to know how to act,</v>

428
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.410
<v Speaker 2>how to conduct ourselves in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're moving creatures,</v>

429
00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:31.411
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't just sit there on a rock and </v>

430
00:22:31.411 --> 00:22:32.740
<v Speaker 2>filter seawater through our guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to go out there and contend with</v>

431
00:22:32.741 --> 00:22:34.690
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we need to know how to do that,</v>

432
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 2>we need to know how to do it and how not</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

433
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:40.630
<v Speaker 2>So we can look for good examples and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can look for bad examples.</v>

434
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.900
<v Speaker 2>We don't want just any old good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want a good example that's boiled </v>

435
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.831
<v Speaker 2>right down to excellent example and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want a bad example that's boiled right </v>

436
00:22:49.831 --> 00:22:50.470
<v Speaker 2>down to excellent bad example.</v>

437
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:55.830
<v Speaker 2>And so a good example would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>character who is an amalgam of all the </v>

438
00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.181
<v Speaker 2>good things about good people and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil character would be an announcement </v>

439
00:23:00.181 --> 00:23:02.740
<v Speaker 2>of all evil things about bad people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more pure in some sense,</v>

440
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:07.741
<v Speaker 2>in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of those characters are the more </v>

441
00:23:07.741 --> 00:23:10.111
<v Speaker 2>architects of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so an archetypal story is good </v>

442
00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:10.900
<v Speaker 2>versus evil and you might think you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't believe in good versus evil,</v>

443
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't really matter what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe because when you go to movies,</v>

444
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 2>you watch that and you watch it as if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe it.</v>

445
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:20.710
<v Speaker 2>And I would say this is an existential </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim by the way,</v>

446
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.230
<v Speaker 2>is that it doesn't matter what you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe,</v>

447
00:23:23.231 --> 00:23:28.231
<v Speaker 2>because what do you know about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters is how you act out what you </v>

448
00:23:28.231 --> 00:23:32.101
<v Speaker 2>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you really want to find out what </v>

449
00:23:32.101 --> 00:23:32.380
<v Speaker 2>you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't ask yourself what you believe.</v>

450
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.620
<v Speaker 2>You Watch yourself act and you did those</v>
<v Speaker 2>from that what you believe.</v>

451
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.440
<v Speaker 2>And so if you don't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

452
00:23:41.441 --> 00:23:44.620
<v Speaker 2>in a good versus evil architectural </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle and what are you doing?</v>

453
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Watching wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

454
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously that's an archetypal </v>

455
00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.761
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like Harry Potter is an archetypal </v>

456
00:23:54.761 --> 00:23:54.761
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And both of those are archetypal stories</v>

457
00:23:54.761 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 2>about good versus evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

458
00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Next set of categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that we've been living in </v>

459
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.240
<v Speaker 2>familial groups for who knows how long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say 3 million years.</v>

460
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Just for the sake of argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were living in tribal groups way,</v>

461
00:24:12.861 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 2>way longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

462
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:19.470
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about a tribal group at </v>

463
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.191
<v Speaker 2>something that might extend back farther</v>
<v Speaker 2>than chimpanzees were living in </v>

464
00:24:21.191 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies for way longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>than tribal groups,</v>

465
00:24:23.481 --> 00:24:28.481
<v Speaker 2>but the family group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to think we'd be living in </v>

466
00:24:28.481 --> 00:24:32.351
<v Speaker 2>family groups for about as long as we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been extraordinarily dependent as </v>

467
00:24:32.351 --> 00:24:35.210
<v Speaker 2>infants and as long as we've had really </v>
<v Speaker 2>large brains.</v>

468
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.050
<v Speaker 2>And so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you can't draw,</v>

469
00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pipeline.</v>

470
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.830
<v Speaker 2>But because we'd been getting bigger and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger brains for quite a long time,</v>

471
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in the millions of years let's say.</v>

472
00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing that you might think</v>

473
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 2>about is that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cognitive apparatus,</v>

474
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:57.521
<v Speaker 2>your perceptual apparatus to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional apparatus has originated </v>

475
00:24:57.521 --> 00:25:01.931
<v Speaker 2>within an environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously now we tend to think of the </v>

476
00:25:01.931 --> 00:25:03.140
<v Speaker 2>environment as the natural environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we tend to think of the natural</v>

477
00:25:03.141 --> 00:25:07.480
<v Speaker 2>environment is like a forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the natural environment for primates</v>

478
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.610
<v Speaker 2>say is only forest to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

479
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:15.611
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't just dwell in forests because </v>

480
00:25:15.611 --> 00:25:18.131
<v Speaker 2>we were also veldt dwelling creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also we didn't really dwell among </v>

481
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.260
<v Speaker 2>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We dwelled among other primates like us,</v>

482
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.060
<v Speaker 2>and so our primary environment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually other people and then you might</v>

483
00:25:26.061 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

484
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 2>what are the fundamental categories of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other people?</v>

485
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about mother?</v>

486
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one because the probability</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you had a mother,</v>

487
00:25:35.501 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's up there at about 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

488
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if there wasn't even if you're new,</v>

489
00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:43.160
<v Speaker 2>you lost your biological mother at </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth.</v>

490
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.850
<v Speaker 2>If someone didn't fulfill the archetypal</v>
<v Speaker 2>role as mother,</v>

491
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
<v Speaker 2>then you don't live and that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>just mean providing you with food and </v>

492
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.020
<v Speaker 2>water and shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you provide a child under one</v>

493
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.170
<v Speaker 2>with food and water and shelter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it,</v>

494
00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 2>they die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to pick them up,</v>

495
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you have to touch them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to rock them back and forth.</v>

496
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:07.990
<v Speaker 2>You have to communicate with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't give them physical </v>

497
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:09.410
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their nervous systems shut down and they</v>

498
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:14.411
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's part of the reason why in </v>

499
00:26:14.411 --> 00:26:17.200
<v Speaker 2>well in eastern European orphanages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orphanages before the wall fell down,</v>

500
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.840
<v Speaker 2>the death rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in places like Romania in the</v>

501
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 2>orphanage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's an awful story,</v>

502
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.380
<v Speaker 2>was unbelievably high.</v>

503
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:29.380
<v Speaker 2>And if the kids didn't die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just so crippled </v>

504
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.541
<v Speaker 2>psychologically that they never </v>
<v Speaker 2>recovered and that was because people </v>

505
00:26:31.541 --> 00:26:31.541
<v Speaker 2>didn't touch them and didn't interact </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>

506
00:26:31.541 --> 00:26:36.430
<v Speaker 2>And so you need a creature playing out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the architectural role of mother to </v>

507
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:40.730
<v Speaker 2>entice you into life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you just perish.</v>

508
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:42.710
<v Speaker 2>So mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a category man.</v>

509
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:47.990
<v Speaker 2>And then well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fathers to category two and it's the </v>

510
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 2>same thing applies there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if you don't have a father,</v>

511
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.450
<v Speaker 2>there's a male power structure around </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

512
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.370
<v Speaker 2>a dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking,</v>

513
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.640
<v Speaker 2>that acts in the paternal role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no getting away from that </v>

514
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:02.430
<v Speaker 2>unless you don't live in a society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you don't live in a society,</v>

515
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:04.740
<v Speaker 2>then you just die because you can't live</v>
<v Speaker 2>by yourself.</v>

516
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 2>So father and mother are primary </v>
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>

517
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:12.420
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the primary category of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the individual because wherever you are,</v>

518
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:13.350
<v Speaker 2>there you are.</v>

519
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's been the case for every human</v>
<v Speaker 2>being that's ever existed.</v>

520
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.040
<v Speaker 2>So the fundamental categories are </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>

521
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.390
<v Speaker 2>mother and father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's another fundamental category</v>

522
00:27:24.391 --> 00:27:29.391
<v Speaker 2>which we alluded to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is horrible thing that lives at </v>

523
00:27:29.391 --> 00:27:29.391
<v Speaker 2>the bottom of a pit that will devour </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

524
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.090
<v Speaker 2>And that has a psychological reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective,</v>

525
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:33.960
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

526
00:27:33.961 --> 00:27:38.961
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's equivalent to the story of Jonah </v>

527
00:27:38.961 --> 00:27:38.961
<v Speaker 2>being gobbled up by the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happens.</v>

528
00:27:38.961 --> 00:27:41.910
<v Speaker 2>That sort of story is very common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio is a story like that,</v>

529
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinocchio has an existential problem.</v>

530
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.600
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know how to be a real boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that in order to become a </v>

531
00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.201
<v Speaker 2>real boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might regard that as a fully </v>

532
00:27:54.201 --> 00:27:56.781
<v Speaker 2>developed individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has to go down to the bottom of the </v>

533
00:27:56.781 --> 00:27:56.781
<v Speaker 2>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a whale,</v>

534
00:27:56.781 --> 00:27:59.280
<v Speaker 2>and rescue his father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

535
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.200
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take a lot of imagination to </v>

536
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.840
<v Speaker 2>see the kinship between that story and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story of Jonah.</v>

537
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.200
<v Speaker 2>It's the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonah had to reestablish his </v>

538
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.171
<v Speaker 2>relationship with God the father in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to successfully make a passage </v>

539
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:20.241
<v Speaker 2>from aimless and disobedient character </v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone who was alive on shore and </v>

540
00:28:21.481 --> 00:28:24.540
<v Speaker 2>pursuing a particular path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same motif.</v>

541
00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:25.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

542
00:28:25.201 --> 00:28:30.201
<v Speaker 2>very common motif.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that that's </v>

543
00:28:30.201 --> 00:28:31.860
<v Speaker 2>how people transform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

544
00:28:31.861 --> 00:28:36.861
<v Speaker 2>they hit an obstacle of some sort that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just blows them into pieces and they go </v>

545
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:41.610
<v Speaker 2>down into the depths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the abyss and they lived down there</v>

546
00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:45.600
<v Speaker 2>for awhile and it's not pleasant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they learn something while they're</v>

547
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:50.601
<v Speaker 2>down there if they're lucky and they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>back up and that's the story of human </v>

548
00:28:50.601 --> 00:28:52.500
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never learn something without having</v>

549
00:28:52.501 --> 00:28:57.501
<v Speaker 2>something small die and sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn something and something big dies </v>

550
00:28:57.501 --> 00:29:02.450
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put yourself back together and you </v>

551
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:03.060
<v Speaker 2>pick up the pieces and you emerge </v>
<v Speaker 2>unscathed,</v>

552
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.490
<v Speaker 2>hopefully in perhaps transformed and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>carry on.</v>

553
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:10.490
<v Speaker 2>And so the human developmental story </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't an upward march in a linear </v>

554
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:12.360
<v Speaker 2>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

555
00:29:12.361 --> 00:29:15.900
<v Speaker 2>up on even slope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's perhaps upwards and onwards,</v>

556
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:18.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's punctuated by catastrophes.</v>

557
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.200
<v Speaker 2>And of course you guys know that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

558
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:27.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people in this room have been </v>

559
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:29.160
<v Speaker 2>seriously unhappy at one point in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>life for more than two weeks.</v>

560
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anyone who hasn't had that </v>

561
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.690
<v Speaker 2>experience breathing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

562
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Have you not had that experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

563
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

564
00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:42.520
<v Speaker 2>I thought you raised your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has Anybody had that experience?</v>

565
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

566
00:29:45.011 --> 00:29:48.310
<v Speaker 2>So maybe not you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

567
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:49.870
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations.</v>

568
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:50.800
<v Speaker 2>That's really amazing.</v>

569
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:55.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

570
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

571
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 2>so the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know here,</v>

572
00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.220
<v Speaker 2>here's one way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's reality.</v>

573
00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Reality is that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your environment is punctuated by </v>

574
00:30:12.381 --> 00:30:17.080
<v Speaker 2>desense your pathways punctuated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>descent and when you're ascending,</v>

575
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 2>that's one place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you're descending and at the </v>

576
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:22.130
<v Speaker 2>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another place.</v>

577
00:30:22.131 --> 00:30:27.131
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you that and this will </v>
<v Speaker 2>help you with your interpretation of </v>

578
00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:29.981
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the times when you descend is </v>

579
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:31.100
<v Speaker 2>equivalent to a voyage to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underworld.</v>

580
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what a voyage to the underworld </v>
<v Speaker 2>means and mythology.</v>

581
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.760
<v Speaker 2>The bottom has fallen out and down you </v>
<v Speaker 2>go and you know,</v>

582
00:30:37.761 --> 00:30:41.120
<v Speaker 2>this sort of thing because look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I say we're all skating on thin ice,</v>

583
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.490
<v Speaker 2>like is there anybody here who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what that means?</v>

584
00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does it mean?</v>

585
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:51.250
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean to break?</v>

586
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.980
<v Speaker 2>The ice can fall out in anytime and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens down?</v>

587
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.000
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

588
00:30:59.001 --> 00:31:00.590
<v Speaker 2>And it's cold down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

589
00:31:00.591 --> 00:31:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't get back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

590
00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:07.961
<v Speaker 2>And it's the sort of story that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sends a chill down your spine and it </v>

591
00:31:07.961 --> 00:31:11.921
<v Speaker 2>should because that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that I really </v>

592
00:31:11.921 --> 00:31:16.181
<v Speaker 2>like about advanced personality theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it takes that into account and </v>

593
00:31:16.181 --> 00:31:16.181
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

594
00:31:16.181 --> 00:31:16.181
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's life.</v>

595
00:31:16.181 --> 00:31:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that we've established that,</v>

596
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.580
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so then it becomes something like </v>

597
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.911
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so much how do you stop </v>

598
00:31:27.911 --> 00:31:30.050
<v Speaker 2>yourself from descending and ascending </v>
<v Speaker 2>because good luck with that,</v>

599
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.290
<v Speaker 2>but since you're going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

600
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:38.470
<v Speaker 2>how do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the reason that I called </v>

601
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.380
<v Speaker 2>this course personality and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformations is because one,</v>

602
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.160
<v Speaker 2>one thing that you can learn about </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself as who you are,</v>

603
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:48.190
<v Speaker 2>and that's really useful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing that you can learn </v>

604
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.090
<v Speaker 2>about yourself is how it is that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>conduct yourself across time.</v>

605
00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:54.290
<v Speaker 2>And that means you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conduct yourself so that you can weather</v>

606
00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:59.291
<v Speaker 2>storms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of those might be you make a </v>

607
00:31:59.291 --> 00:31:59.291
<v Speaker 2>mistake in the ice breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

608
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 2>And some of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

609
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.470
<v Speaker 2>the ice breaks and it's no mistake at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

610
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:05.660
<v Speaker 2>it's just how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

611
00:32:05.661 --> 00:32:10.661
<v Speaker 2>so when you're one of your parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed Alzheimer's disease for </v>

612
00:32:10.661 --> 00:32:13.631
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could say that's your mistake </v>

613
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:13.631
<v Speaker 2>because you're not smart enough to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about it and you know,</v>

614
00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:18.110
<v Speaker 2>be a better clue in because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 2>the disease is going to continue.</v>

615
00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:23.290
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really thinking about it as a personal </v>

616
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.111
<v Speaker 2>fault seems inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a catastrophe that's </v>

617
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:27.830
<v Speaker 2>associated with being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what life is,</v>

618
00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.300
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things you see,</v>

619
00:32:29.301 --> 00:32:34.301
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all of the major trends of religious </v>

620
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:37.751
<v Speaker 2>thinking all around the world and talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about religious thinking because those </v>

621
00:32:37.751 --> 00:32:37.760
<v Speaker 2>are the deepest kinds of stories.</v>

622
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Speaker 2>That's really what makes them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

623
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.890
<v Speaker 2>it's always the same message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is suffering.</v>

624
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.980
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>skate on thin ice.</v>

625
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can say,</v>

626
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:52.061
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should pick up the damn ice and fair </v>

627
00:32:52.061 --> 00:32:52.061
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

628
00:32:52.061 --> 00:32:52.061
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

629
00:32:52.061 --> 00:32:54.560
<v Speaker 2>But you should also prepare yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>swim so that when you fall in,</v>

630
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:59.561
<v Speaker 2>you don't die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the job story has a hint or two </v>

631
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:01.250
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.460
<v Speaker 2>so the first thing that happens is job </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in some sense called the action now </v>

633
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.200
<v Speaker 2>because that's an old story because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a primarily Judaeo Christian and </v>

634
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.471
<v Speaker 2>religious story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The call to action takes the force of a </v>

635
00:33:14.471 --> 00:33:15.440
<v Speaker 2>divine command.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now you might think,</v>

636
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:20.441
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's such a thing exist and it's a </v>

637
00:33:20.441 --> 00:33:23.981
<v Speaker 2>silly question in some ways because </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not something exists depends </v>

638
00:33:24.201 --> 00:33:26.540
<v Speaker 2>on what you mean by exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:30.380
<v Speaker 2>and that can vary with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical presuppositions,</v>

640
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.800
<v Speaker 2>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also varies on why you're asking the </v>

641
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.620
<v Speaker 2>question and where you're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer.</v>

642
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.740
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an example.</v>

643
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe that there are things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you shouldn't do?</v>

644
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Like is there anyone here who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that?</v>

645
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Or more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anyone here who doesn't act </v>

646
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.091
<v Speaker 2>like they believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you wake up in the morning and you </v>

647
00:33:58.091 --> 00:33:58.091
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

648
00:33:58.091 --> 00:34:00.851
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of things I should do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or are there some things I should do </v>

649
00:34:00.851 --> 00:34:04.301
<v Speaker 2>next week?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are there some things I should do with </v>

650
00:34:04.301 --> 00:34:04.301
<v Speaker 2>my life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

651
00:34:04.301 --> 00:34:06.020
<v Speaker 2>that's a common thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is anyone not think that way?</v>

652
00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

653
00:34:08.291 --> 00:34:11.080
<v Speaker 2>if you're not thinking that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up pretty depressed because then</v>

654
00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:11.530
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

655
00:34:11.531 --> 00:34:16.531
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing I should do with my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not such a happy thought </v>

656
00:34:16.531 --> 00:34:17.890
<v Speaker 2>because life is hard and then if there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with this wall,</v>

657
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.980
<v Speaker 2>all you're they're stuck with is a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of suffering and that doesn't seem like </v>

658
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:23.440
<v Speaker 2>a very good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

659
00:34:23.441 --> 00:34:24.400
<v Speaker 2>so then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

660
00:34:24.401 --> 00:34:26.140
<v Speaker 2>what exactly does should mean?</v>

661
00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means that you have a moral </v>

662
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:33.930
<v Speaker 2>obligation of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

663
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:36.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decided that yourself and the answer</v>

664
00:34:36.071 --> 00:34:39.220
<v Speaker 2>that it's like no wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't decided that you yourself,</v>

665
00:34:39.221 --> 00:34:41.980
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be at a complete psychopath if you</v>

666
00:34:41.981 --> 00:34:44.080
<v Speaker 2>decided that by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

667
00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:46.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're even the Vegas civilized,</v>

668
00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:52.170
<v Speaker 2>then you decide what it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should do or what you should do </v>

669
00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:56.461
<v Speaker 2>manifests itself within you as a context</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a dialogue that you're continually </v>

670
00:34:56.461 --> 00:35:01.081
<v Speaker 2>having with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also with everyone around you and </v>

671
00:35:01.081 --> 00:35:04.321
<v Speaker 2>not only only with everyone around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with the entire history of mankind </v>

672
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:09.630
<v Speaker 2>because we're all historical creatures </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know what you think you should </v>

673
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:14.341
<v Speaker 2>do is been shaped by what your parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of that was shaped by what their </v>

674
00:35:14.341 --> 00:35:16.840
<v Speaker 2>parents thought that was shaped by what </v>
<v Speaker 2>their parents thought and so on.</v>

675
00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.970
<v Speaker 2>Back into the depths of history as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>back as you can possibly imagine,</v>

676
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
<v Speaker 2>both historically and biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in some sense there is a call to </v>

677
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.400
<v Speaker 2>action within people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

678
00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:33.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any sort of quest story like the </v>

679
00:35:33.401 --> 00:35:33.401
<v Speaker 2>Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

680
00:35:33.401 --> 00:35:34.870
<v Speaker 2>or the Lord of the rings for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter.</v>

681
00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story always starts with a call to </v>

682
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:40.110
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

683
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 2>For some reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little hobbit character,</v>

684
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:42.940
<v Speaker 2>which by the way is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

685
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.870
<v Speaker 2>the hobbits live in this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected place and they're not very big</v>

686
00:35:45.871 --> 00:35:50.871
<v Speaker 2>and they're not very smart and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know about the wide world beyond </v>

687
00:35:50.871 --> 00:35:54.441
<v Speaker 2>the board of the great forces of good </v>
<v Speaker 2>and evil are at combat and one hobbit </v>

688
00:35:54.441 --> 00:35:58.491
<v Speaker 2>who's a little bit more adventurous than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest gets called act gets called </v>

689
00:35:58.491 --> 00:36:01.790
<v Speaker 2>upon to act and in harbord stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's usually the wizard who manages it,</v>

690
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

691
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's a magical figure of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's extraordinarily wise and </v>

692
00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.050
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily old who might as well be</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone for all intents and purposes,</v>

693
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:10.860
<v Speaker 2>who says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

694
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:13.170
<v Speaker 2>it's time for you to go and become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thief.</v>

695
00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens in the Hobbit,</v>

696
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:19.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because very weird thing because </v>

697
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's Frodo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

698
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.650
<v Speaker 2>Photos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hobbit in the Hobbit,</v>

699
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:24.420
<v Speaker 2>and Bilbo is the hobbit and the Lord of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rings.</v>

700
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.590
<v Speaker 2>If I remembered the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bilbo is the poverty in the hobbit.</v>

701
00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bilbo.</v>

702
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so bill will gets called to action and </v>

703
00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:35.000
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna.</v>

704
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Go find a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dragon is the same thing,</v>

705
00:36:38.281 --> 00:36:43.281
<v Speaker 2>that swallow job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same story and the Jew and the </v>

706
00:36:43.281 --> 00:36:43.710
<v Speaker 2>dragon has a treasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a weird thing.</v>

707
00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:45.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's up with dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

708
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:47.370
<v Speaker 2>What do they hoard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virgins.</v>

709
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.250
<v Speaker 2>That's the St George Story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>

710
00:36:50.251 --> 00:36:55.251
<v Speaker 2>very old story or goal and that's weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior for a predatory lizard,</v>

711
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.050
<v Speaker 2>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you accept that without any problem with</v>

712
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:03.080
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dragon lives underground in a big </v>

713
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:03.080
<v Speaker 2>mountain that was excavated by doors and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sits on a treasure.</v>

714
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like we go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any problem with that </v>

715
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:08.120
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

716
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:08.280
<v Speaker 2>why fate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean really,</v>

717
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.190
<v Speaker 2>you really believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is well,</v>

718
00:37:11.191 --> 00:37:13.350
<v Speaker 2>well enough to read the damn book and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the.</v>

719
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:18.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people went and watched the </v>

720
00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Lord of the Rings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people?</v>

721
00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.450
<v Speaker 2>And think about it worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much money did a Harry Potter </v>

722
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.110
<v Speaker 2>generate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

723
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:30.111
<v Speaker 2>I bet to Harry Potter generated more </v>
<v Speaker 2>money than the remaining steel mills in </v>

724
00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:35.121
<v Speaker 2>Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you calculated it across the amount </v>

725
00:37:35.121 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 2>of time since those stories emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

726
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.460
<v Speaker 2>So of course there's a lizard in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>predatory lizard and Harry Potter too.</v>

727
00:37:41.461 --> 00:37:46.461
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing that skitters around </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath hogwarts and turns you to </v>

728
00:37:46.461 --> 00:37:46.461
<v Speaker 2>stone with the glance of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

729
00:37:46.461 --> 00:37:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and does that Lizard Hoard vergence?</v>

730
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the name of the woman that.</v>

731
00:37:52.401 --> 00:37:57.401
<v Speaker 2>The girl that he kidnaps Jenny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

732
00:37:58.101 --> 00:37:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the word?</v>

733
00:37:59.691 --> 00:38:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Jenny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>From Virginia.</v>

734
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

735
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's Harry's first month interest </v>

736
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.590
<v Speaker 2>and he rescues her from the damn snake </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he gets parallels.</v>

737
00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Won't paralyze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't while he's doing it.</v>

738
00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:19.420
<v Speaker 2>What rescue is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harry Phoenix,</v>

739
00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Phoenix.</v>

740
00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Bass Bites Harry and so he's </v>

741
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:26.480
<v Speaker 2>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Phoenix comes along.</v>

742
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.560
<v Speaker 2>Who owns the Phoenix?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dumbledore.</v>

743
00:38:28.561 --> 00:38:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

744
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:34.380
<v Speaker 2>What does the Phoenix do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cries and cries into Harry's wounds.</v>

745
00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens then?</v>

746
00:38:36.821 --> 00:38:39.070
<v Speaker 2>What happens to Harry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes back to life.</v>

747
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Death and resurrection story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing that's willing to die and </v>

748
00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:47.140
<v Speaker 2>resurrect is the thing that gets the </v>
<v Speaker 2>virgin from the snake.</v>

749
00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that make sense?</v>

750
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it makes sense even though you</v>

751
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:55.700
<v Speaker 2>don't really know why it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happens to the what?</v>

752
00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Ams to the Phoenix after it does that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Burns itself up in a puff of flame and </v>

753
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:07.801
<v Speaker 2>is reborn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's the story told twice the thing </v>

754
00:39:07.801 --> 00:39:10.771
<v Speaker 2>that dies in Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reborn is the thing that conquers the </v>

755
00:39:10.771 --> 00:39:14.170
<v Speaker 2>serpentine and and rescues the feminine </v>
<v Speaker 2>roughly speaking.</v>

756
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:18.520
<v Speaker 2>So it's not gold in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

757
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.650
<v Speaker 2>It's the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always the same story.</v>

758
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.380
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you don't hear that story,</v>

759
00:39:23.381 --> 00:39:28.381
<v Speaker 2>like when your culture isn't providing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you with rich stories of that sort that </v>

760
00:39:28.381 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 2>are derived directly from your </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition.</v>

761
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:34.380
<v Speaker 2>Somebody like an unemployed welfare </v>
<v Speaker 2>mother in Britain has it pop up full </v>

762
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:39.511
<v Speaker 2>fledged into her brilliant imagination </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lays out seven books and makes </v>

763
00:39:39.511 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 2>herself more money than the queen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

764
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:41.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

765
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a cinderella story.</v>

766
00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:46.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a bloody amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all those books and all</v>

767
00:39:46.721 --> 00:39:48.520
<v Speaker 2>those kids learn to read because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>

768
00:39:48.521 --> 00:39:53.521
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all those movies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody goes and sees them and no one </v>

769
00:39:53.521 --> 00:39:56.521
<v Speaker 2>notices that they don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell they're doing while they're doing </v>

770
00:39:56.521 --> 00:39:56.770
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it follows the same old story.</v>

771
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got your individual that's </v>

772
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:02.520
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hero,</v>

773
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.970
<v Speaker 2>then you got the adversary to that.</v>

774
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.700
<v Speaker 2>That's your enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wherever that enemy might happen to me,</v>

775
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.310
<v Speaker 2>that's the forces that oppose oppose </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

776
00:40:09.311 --> 00:40:11.770
<v Speaker 2>but mostly psychological forces of one </v>
<v Speaker 2>form or another.</v>

777
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got the father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

778
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.260
<v Speaker 2>there's two kinds of fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What guy?</v>

779
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Good for others and bad fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's an example.</v>

780
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm the lion king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the lion king as a father,</v>

781
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:33.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A asa and asa has a brother who's his </v>

782
00:40:35.201 --> 00:40:40.000
<v Speaker 2>brother scar and what's up with scar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a pleasant guy.</v>

783
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Partly maybe because he's scarred </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

784
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well really a,</v>

785
00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:49.320
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he came from the shallow end of </v>

786
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.291
<v Speaker 2>the gene pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously something's happened to him </v>

787
00:40:52.291 --> 00:40:52.780
<v Speaker 2>because he has this scar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's arrogant and brilliant,</v>

788
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:57.310
<v Speaker 2>which is very common set of attributes </v>
<v Speaker 2>for negative father figures and he's out</v>

789
00:40:57.311 --> 00:40:59.350
<v Speaker 2>to doing the cane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

790
00:40:59.351 --> 00:41:01.270
<v Speaker 2>So what does he represent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

791
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.840
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a way of thinking about it </v>

792
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:06.840
<v Speaker 2>sociologically.</v>

793
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.330
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you hear very </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently,</v>

794
00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure many of you have heard this ad </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nauseum,</v>

795
00:41:09.461 --> 00:41:11.440
<v Speaker 2>is that there's such a thing as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy,</v>

796
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The patriarchy,</v>

797
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.550
<v Speaker 2>while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

798
00:41:13.551 --> 00:41:17.710
<v Speaker 2>The Petro Patriarchy is a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct and I mean that,</v>

799
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean that technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a paternal figure that </v>

800
00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:28.261
<v Speaker 2>basically represents it can represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>the father directly or it can represent </v>

801
00:41:28.261 --> 00:41:30.070
<v Speaker 2>the structure of male power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just male power,</v>

802
00:41:30.071 --> 00:41:31.930
<v Speaker 2>but whatever for for the time being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

803
00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:37.130
<v Speaker 2>we'll stick with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a positive aspect which is why </v>

804
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:38.390
<v Speaker 2>you get to sit here and you're not being</v>
<v Speaker 2>snowed on and freezing to death.</v>

805
00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:43.580
<v Speaker 2>So that's the positive element and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a negative element and the negative </v>

806
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.340
<v Speaker 2>element is the arbitrary tyranny that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with any social organization.</v>

807
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:47.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

808
00:41:47.301 --> 00:41:52.301
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of the u of t like </v>

809
00:41:52.301 --> 00:41:52.970
<v Speaker 2>your first year?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you enjoy it?</v>

810
00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.360
<v Speaker 2>How many people didn't enjoy it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

811
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:02.060
<v Speaker 2>How many people did enjoy it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

812
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:03.470
<v Speaker 2>so mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the looks of things,</v>

813
00:42:03.471 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 2>some of you and some of you are neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You either enjoyed it or,</v>

814
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.180
<v Speaker 2>or didn't enjoy it or you don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental energy to crank your arm,</v>

815
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.970
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

816
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.640
<v Speaker 2>So mostly you didn't enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell are you doing here?</v>

817
00:42:16.641 --> 00:42:19.130
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

818
00:42:19.131 --> 00:42:24.131
<v Speaker 2>Why bother?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone who didn't enjoy it as </v>

819
00:42:24.131 --> 00:42:24.440
<v Speaker 2>answered me that maybe you really didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it,</v>

820
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:26.450
<v Speaker 2>but here you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you still here?</v>

821
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the sunk cost answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you,</v>

822
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:36.890
<v Speaker 2>you waited for a bus for half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't shown up.</v>

823
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.320
<v Speaker 2>The right thing to do is wait for </v>
<v Speaker 2>another half an hour.</v>

824
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

825
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put it in the morning,</v>

826
00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:49.250
<v Speaker 3>I approached it from a different angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically I change when I was </v>

827
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.250
<v Speaker 3>starting.</v>

828
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.270
<v Speaker 2>How would that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worked out well,</v>

829
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.260
<v Speaker 2>was it the second time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did try it.</v>

830
00:42:52.261 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 2>It worked out well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

831
00:42:53.451 --> 00:42:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was that an unpleasant process?</v>

832
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Were you confused?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you come out the other end?</v>

833
00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

834
00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.740
<v Speaker 2>right on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You more mature.</v>

835
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

836
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.530
<v Speaker 2>You know more than you did five years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

837
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.060
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it worth it?</v>

838
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.570
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

839
00:43:11.571 --> 00:43:12.680
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

840
00:43:12.681 --> 00:43:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Well Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

841
00:43:13.431 --> 00:43:16.730
<v Speaker 2>you make a calculation and what's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the University of Toronto?</v>

842
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Well there's 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>students for a starter.</v>

843
00:43:19.971 --> 00:43:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Like what the Hell do you matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

844
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 2>really your numbered and it feels like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of the time.</v>

845
00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:32.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very impersonal institution </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're sort of tossed into it so </v>

846
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.971
<v Speaker 2>you're basically facing a giant of some </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude who's kind of blind and who </v>

847
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:41.750
<v Speaker 2>sort of archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is always what culture is,</v>

848
00:43:41.751 --> 00:43:41.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

849
00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Culture is always blind because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>product of yesterday and it's.</v>

850
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:48.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not up to date,</v>

851
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:53.740
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you have that problem when you </v>

852
00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.730
<v Speaker 2>come to the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you stick with it though because it's</v>

853
00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:59.980
<v Speaker 2>got two faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One face is sank or swam there guys.</v>

854
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:05.770
<v Speaker 2>And the other face is man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're careful and you and establish </v>

855
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:06.740
<v Speaker 2>a relationship with this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution,</v>

856
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:12.700
<v Speaker 2>you can learn so much that you won't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even be the same person when you come </v>

857
00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:16.631
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'll be able to think that'd be </v>

858
00:44:16.631 --> 00:44:16.631
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

859
00:44:16.631 --> 00:44:21.270
<v Speaker 2>if you learn to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't run into sharp things </v>

860
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:23.531
<v Speaker 2>when you wander through life because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're smart enough to see where they </v>

861
00:44:23.531 --> 00:44:23.531
<v Speaker 2>are and avoid them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

862
00:44:23.531 --> 00:44:27.310
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you can think your way to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>target or maybe you could even think </v>

863
00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:31.091
<v Speaker 2>about a target that's worthwhile and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can figure out how to attain it and </v>

864
00:44:31.091 --> 00:44:34.180
<v Speaker 2>maybe you learn to write and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can articulate your ideas and you can </v>

865
00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 2>express them with some power and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could make,</v>

866
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be a positive force in the world</v>

867
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 2>and you can be successful in all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ways.</v>

868
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:43.490
<v Speaker 2>And if you have to put up with being </v>
<v Speaker 2>tyrannized by a half dad monster,</v>

869
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Alzheimer's disease,</v>

870
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:51.080
<v Speaker 2>that's blind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's life and it could be a lot </v>

871
00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:55.071
<v Speaker 2>worse because at least you're contending</v>
<v Speaker 2>with something that has a positive </v>

872
00:44:55.071 --> 00:44:55.560
<v Speaker 2>element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

873
00:44:55.561 --> 00:44:57.920
<v Speaker 2>in lots of societies if you're up </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the,</v>

874
00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:03.380
<v Speaker 2>the blind giant of society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best that you can hope for is that </v>

875
00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.740
<v Speaker 2>it isn't running around trying to stomp </v>
<v Speaker 2>on you all the time.</v>

876
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that's more the standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>human experience.</v>

877
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.360
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a patriarchy and yet it's </v>

878
00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:14.360
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it's always been like that,</v>

879
00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:18.591
<v Speaker 2>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's a good guy embedded in </v>

880
00:45:18.591 --> 00:45:21.711
<v Speaker 2>that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the thing you want to have a </v>

881
00:45:21.711 --> 00:45:21.711
<v Speaker 2>relationship with and that's the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>old story.</v>

882
00:45:21.711 --> 00:45:25.941
<v Speaker 2>It's always been like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always a wise king and tyrant </v>

883
00:45:25.941 --> 00:45:27.230
<v Speaker 2>and they're always fighting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the wise king,</v>

884
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.180
<v Speaker 2>king winds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the tyrant winds and then when</v>

885
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:35.181
<v Speaker 2>the tire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's up to the hero to defeat the </v>

886
00:45:35.181 --> 00:45:36.960
<v Speaker 2>tyrant and reestablish the rightful </v>
<v Speaker 2>king,</v>

887
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:42.110
<v Speaker 2>and that's actually what you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do when you're in university because </v>

888
00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:45.831
<v Speaker 2>the rightful king in some senses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a corpse that's embedded inside the </v>

889
00:45:45.831 --> 00:45:47.280
<v Speaker 2>university and your job is to revivify </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

890
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the living element of the </v>

891
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:52.760
<v Speaker 2>university and all the knowledge is </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

892
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.300
<v Speaker 2>It's just lying around and some of it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of date.</v>

893
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come in here and you,</v>

894
00:45:55.710 --> 00:46:00.710
<v Speaker 2>you revise it so that society can </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue and so that you can benefit </v>

895
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:02.040
<v Speaker 2>from the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

896
00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:04.260
<v Speaker 2>that's the positive and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great father,</v>

897
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:08.100
<v Speaker 2>the king and the tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then another,</v>

898
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:12.360
<v Speaker 2>another level is the feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Feminine is not women.</v>

899
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Women partake of the feminine and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>masculine,</v>

900
00:46:15.241 --> 00:46:18.120
<v Speaker 2>just like men partake of the feminine </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the masculine,</v>

901
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:21.870
<v Speaker 2>but the maternal element,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feminine elements is nature.</v>

902
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Positive nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

903
00:46:24.961 --> 00:46:26.820
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>environmentalists love,</v>

904
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's flowers and French landscapes and</v>

905
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasant days,</v>

906
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:35.910
<v Speaker 2>picnic in the park and and beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunshine and fresh air and clean water.</v>

907
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.690
<v Speaker 2>But then there's another side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another side is,</v>

908
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.550
<v Speaker 2>do you know what the Guinea worm is?</v>

909
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody know what a Guinea word is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

910
00:46:44.371 --> 00:46:49.371
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although you're not going to be happy </v>

911
00:46:49.371 --> 00:46:51.711
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a Guinea worm is this horrible </v>

912
00:46:51.711 --> 00:46:52.680
<v Speaker 2>parasite that burrows under the skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly of children,</v>

913
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:55.500
<v Speaker 2>mostly in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's about two feet long,</v>

914
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:58.920
<v Speaker 2>so it makes these coils around their </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs and then it'll poke its little head</v>

915
00:46:58.921 --> 00:47:03.921
<v Speaker 2>out and then you can pull it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it tends to break and if that </v>

916
00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:03.921
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it gets infected.</v>

917
00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:08.751
<v Speaker 2>It May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you die and so you can wrap it </v>

918
00:47:08.751 --> 00:47:08.751
<v Speaker 2>around a pencil very slowly and pull it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

919
00:47:08.751 --> 00:47:13.670
<v Speaker 2>That's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there's a doctor who's a Canadian </v>

920
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:17.211
<v Speaker 2>doctor who wasn't really very happy </v>
<v Speaker 2>about those Damn Guinea worms and he's </v>

921
00:47:17.211 --> 00:47:18.390
<v Speaker 2>just about eradicated them and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>hooray for him,</v>

922
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:23.840
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about the </v>

923
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.281
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when we're thinking about it </v>

924
00:47:25.281 --> 00:47:25.281
<v Speaker 2>and mythological categories and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about nature,</v>

925
00:47:25.281 --> 00:47:25.990
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

926
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nature and all its beneficial </v>

927
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.321
<v Speaker 2>glory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also all the things that would </v>

928
00:47:33.321 --> 00:47:35.581
<v Speaker 2>just assume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat you in the most awful possible way </v>

929
00:47:35.581 --> 00:47:38.550
<v Speaker 2>and you need to know that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you think of nature has only </v>

930
00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.710
<v Speaker 2>been official in its positive archetypal</v>
<v Speaker 2>element that that's mother nature in all</v>

931
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:46.711
<v Speaker 2>her glory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you tend to denigrate the utility </v>

932
00:47:46.711 --> 00:47:46.711
<v Speaker 2>of the positive element of culture.</v>

933
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.380
<v Speaker 2>You know it's culture that protects you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the horrible elements of nature.</v>

934
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.750
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't even be able to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

935
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Nature is beautiful if you weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>already so protected from it.</v>

936
00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:02.230
<v Speaker 2>You know you're more protected from it </v>
<v Speaker 2>than any human beings ever have been </v>

937
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:06.930
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in the entire history of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in this unbelievably protected </v>

938
00:48:07.601 --> 00:48:08.680
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can think,</v>

939
00:48:08.681 --> 00:48:11.680
<v Speaker 2>oh well we should go easy on nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>because isn't it so beautiful?</v>

940
00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:12.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

941
00:48:12.761 --> 00:48:14.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>

942
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:20.130
<v Speaker 2>And it's not all beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly not because nature will </v>

943
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.870
<v Speaker 2>eventually kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it even if it doesn't go well,</v>

944
00:48:21.871 --> 00:48:24.070
<v Speaker 2>it's going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will also make you sick.</v>

945
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:27.880
<v Speaker 2>It will also make everyone that you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>sick and it will kill all of them too.</v>

946
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's not so such a bad thing to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of empathy for human beings</v>

947
00:48:31.931 --> 00:48:33.670
<v Speaker 2>given that we have to contend with that.</v>

948
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.710
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're destroying everything,</v>

949
00:48:35.711 --> 00:48:38.830
<v Speaker 2>which we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also returning the favor.</v>

950
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.170
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

951
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:43.780
<v Speaker 2>so there's the sub stripe at the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>

952
00:48:43.781 --> 00:48:46.510
<v Speaker 2>There's this terrible monster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it hoards gold.</v>

953
00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.400
<v Speaker 2>And so encountering it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defeating it,</v>

954
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:53.430
<v Speaker 2>challenging it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facing it can be unbelievably </v>

955
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:57.630
<v Speaker 2>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a symbol of the absolute </v>

956
00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:00.391
<v Speaker 2>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you go when things fall </v>

957
00:49:00.391 --> 00:49:00.391
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know where you are.</v>

958
00:49:00.391 --> 00:49:02.110
<v Speaker 2>So where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're aware,</v>

959
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:04.900
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what things are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a place.</v>

960
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.580
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are rules to act in that place and</v>

961
00:49:09.581 --> 00:49:12.160
<v Speaker 2>that's what's so helpful because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

962
00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:16.600
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a place that you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do and that's that you're done.</v>

963
00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:19.990
<v Speaker 2>But if there's a pattern to what you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do in a circumstance like that,</v>

964
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:25.000
<v Speaker 2>then in July and on your feet and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>ready to contend and maybe the trip down</v>

965
00:49:25.001 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 2>into the underworld is something you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>undertake on your own accord.</v>

966
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:33.030
<v Speaker 2>And you can come back with the treasurer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and steadying instead of ending up as </v>

967
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:36.390
<v Speaker 2>dragon food or worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're conceptualizing </v>

968
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:37.840
<v Speaker 2>your relationship to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

969
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.090
<v Speaker 2>well let's say this society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

970
00:49:40.091 --> 00:49:40.660
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

971
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:43.180
<v Speaker 2>obviously you face a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you do.</v>

972
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:48.480
<v Speaker 2>But that is all you face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you need to be grateful for what </v>

973
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.780
<v Speaker 2>you've been given by your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you actually have to understand what</v>

974
00:49:49.781 --> 00:49:54.730
<v Speaker 2>that culture is because it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't rescue that part of you</v>

975
00:49:54.731 --> 00:49:59.731
<v Speaker 2>and that part of the culture that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything gets dad and stale and </v>

976
00:49:59.731 --> 00:50:00.550
<v Speaker 2>tyrannical and everything goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately to help.</v>

977
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:04.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then with regards to nature,</v>

978
00:50:04.661 --> 00:50:09.661
<v Speaker 2>well you obviously have to appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the positive element of nature and you </v>

979
00:50:09.661 --> 00:50:10.330
<v Speaker 2>have to enter into a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

980
00:50:10.331 --> 00:50:15.331
<v Speaker 2>but you don't bloody well want to forget</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like things are out to get you and </v>

981
00:50:15.701 --> 00:50:20.701
<v Speaker 2>you know you have to be intelligent and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ready and awake so that you can </v>

982
00:50:20.701 --> 00:50:24.340
<v Speaker 2>prevail against them and you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>grateful for what you've been offered by</v>

983
00:50:24.341 --> 00:50:29.341
<v Speaker 2>other people and by the tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts of all of culture across all of </v>

984
00:50:29.341 --> 00:50:33.671
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's put you in a position where </v>

985
00:50:33.671 --> 00:50:35.741
<v Speaker 2>you're so unbelievably privileged and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have so many opportunities at your,</v>

986
00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.140
<v Speaker 2>at your disposal.</v>

987
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of the archetypal story </v>

988
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.820
<v Speaker 2>of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always face nature and it's always on</v>

989
00:50:46.821 --> 00:50:49.130
<v Speaker 2>our side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always face our culture.</v>

990
00:50:49.131 --> 00:50:53.060
<v Speaker 2>It's always on our site and we always </v>
<v Speaker 2>have ourselves and those things that are</v>

991
00:50:53.061 --> 00:50:55.610
<v Speaker 2>arrayed against us internally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>externally.</v>

992
00:50:56.210 --> 00:51:01.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could say that's the existential </v>

993
00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:04.271
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the world of drama and the things </v>

994
00:51:04.271 --> 00:51:05.390
<v Speaker 2>that are really compelling to you as </v>
<v Speaker 2>means of communicating.</v>

995
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Use those categories to provide you with</v>
<v Speaker 2>information because what you're trying </v>

996
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 2>to figure out is if that's the landscape</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes up your being.</v>

997
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:19.700
<v Speaker 2>So that's a phenomenological idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it that you weave your way </v>

998
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:23.111
<v Speaker 2>through it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While that's what we're going to figure </v>

999
00:51:23.111 --> 00:51:23.111
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1000
00:51:23.111 --> 00:51:23.111
<v Speaker 2>we go through this class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1001
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:27.350
<v Speaker 2>so that's the mythological background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's the character,</v>

1002
00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:29.030
<v Speaker 2>illogical elements that I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>described.</v>

1003
00:51:29.031 --> 00:51:32.390
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the punctuated movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

1004
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with that is that when </v>

1005
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:39.701
<v Speaker 2>things fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you just fall apart </v>

1006
00:51:39.701 --> 00:51:41.360
<v Speaker 2>psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a psychological condition.</v>

1007
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone's be trade you deeply,</v>

1008
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:48.680
<v Speaker 2>that might be because you're naive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unready and maybe that's a psychological</v>

1009
00:51:48.681 --> 00:51:50.500
<v Speaker 2>element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're just young and you know you</v>

1010
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:55.510
<v Speaker 2>don't know battery and you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also the real fact of the </v>

1011
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:59.681
<v Speaker 2>problem that you have in fact been </v>
<v Speaker 2>betrayed and now you don't know what to </v>

1012
00:51:59.681 --> 00:52:00.560
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's reality in it as well as just</v>

1013
00:52:00.561 --> 00:52:01.520
<v Speaker 2>what psychological.</v>

1014
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.930
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

1015
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:10.120
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the ways that you might construe </v>

1016
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.310
<v Speaker 2>personality theories that have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a description of the way people are</v>

1017
00:52:13.311 --> 00:52:18.311
<v Speaker 2>and a description of how they might move</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards mental health is that there are </v>

1018
00:52:18.311 --> 00:52:22.661
<v Speaker 2>maps that tell you how to their maps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that landscape that tell you how to </v>

1019
00:52:22.761 --> 00:52:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Orient Yourself so that you can succeed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and even better,</v>

1020
00:52:26.571 --> 00:52:31.040
<v Speaker 2>and this is a Piagetian idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not only so that you can succeed,</v>

1021
00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:36.940
<v Speaker 2>it's so that you can succeed in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your family succeed so that they </v>

1022
00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.620
<v Speaker 2>can succeed in a way that society </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeeds so that everything works better</v>

1023
00:52:39.621 --> 00:52:42.530
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really success,</v>

1024
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:48.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's like you're winning a game </v>

1025
00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:48.080
<v Speaker 2>that everyone wants to play well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a deal.</v>

1026
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.650
<v Speaker 2>You get to move forward and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else gets to enjoy it.</v>

1027
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good definition of success.</v>

1028
00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.570
<v Speaker 2>It's an architectural definition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>success actually,</v>

1029
00:52:56.571 --> 00:53:00.680
<v Speaker 2>because if you succeed properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your success benefits everyone else</v>

1030
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 2>so hard to imagine that there could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything particularly wrong with that.</v>

1031
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

1032
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:14.710
<v Speaker 2>that's the mythological element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I want to tell you a little bit </v>

1033
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.710
<v Speaker 2>about the shamonic element.</v>

1034
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

1035
00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:22.360
<v Speaker 2>the reason I want to talk to you about </v>
<v Speaker 2>shamanism is because shamanism is a </v>

1036
00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.270
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very old phenomena and Sharmin isn't.</v>

1037
00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:28.271
<v Speaker 2>Looks like a phenomenon that involves </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dramatization of transformation </v>

1038
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:33.441
<v Speaker 2>processes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so so one transformation process might </v>

1039
00:53:33.441 --> 00:53:38.301
<v Speaker 2>be the initiation of young men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's more typical for young men to </v>

1040
00:53:39.451 --> 00:53:42.990
<v Speaker 2>be initiated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then young women and no one really knows</v>

1041
00:53:42.991 --> 00:53:47.991
<v Speaker 2>why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except men seem to be able to go more </v>

1042
00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:50.601
<v Speaker 2>spectacularly wrong than women so well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you look at what we'll talk about </v>

1043
00:53:51.271 --> 00:53:53.850
<v Speaker 2>that later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also competing theories that</v>

1044
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:58.851
<v Speaker 2>say you don't have to initiate women </v>
<v Speaker 2>because nature does that all by itself </v>

1045
00:53:58.851 --> 00:54:02.460
<v Speaker 2>and I think that that's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly bad way of looking at it.</v>

1046
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:07.410
<v Speaker 2>So women are going to be confronted with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brute force of nature,</v>

1047
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:13.970
<v Speaker 2>but men can either do that or not do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's in some sense an element </v>

1048
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.970
<v Speaker 2>of choice.</v>

1049
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:16.710
<v Speaker 2>And so the initiation rituals take away </v>
<v Speaker 2>the element of choice.</v>

1050
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:21.711
<v Speaker 2>And so on a typical initiation ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is that young men usually </v>

1051
00:54:21.711 --> 00:54:24.810
<v Speaker 2>at the onset of puberty or taken away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from their familial dependents,</v>

1052
00:54:24.811 --> 00:54:28.200
<v Speaker 2>which really means their mothers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're put into some situation and</v>

1053
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.650
<v Speaker 2>terrified three quarters to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now more or less,</v>

1054
00:54:31.651 --> 00:54:34.860
<v Speaker 2>they do that voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So perhaps here's an example,</v>

1055
00:54:34.861 --> 00:54:36.630
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're 13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So remember,</v>

1056
00:54:36.631 --> 00:54:39.450
<v Speaker 2>think about your 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>

1057
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're still afraid of the dark </v>

1058
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:44.960
<v Speaker 2>when you're 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they'll tell people that you</v>

1059
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:44.960
<v Speaker 2>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you are.</v>

1060
00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:50.110
<v Speaker 2>And so like if you were dropped naked in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of a forest when you're 13 </v>

1061
00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:53.421
<v Speaker 2>and it's midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be plenty frozen with </v>

1062
00:54:53.421 --> 00:54:56.421
<v Speaker 2>terror and a good thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know it's dangerous out </v>

1063
00:54:56.421 --> 00:54:56.421
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1064
00:54:56.421 --> 00:54:57.750
<v Speaker 2>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe it's just a park,</v>

1065
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:00.920
<v Speaker 2>but you're still out there and it's dark</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're afraid.</v>

1066
00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:01.560
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1067
00:55:01.561 --> 00:55:06.561
<v Speaker 2>what are you afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things you might come up </v>

1068
00:55:06.561 --> 00:55:08.010
<v Speaker 2>with as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're afraid of what you're imagining.</v>

1069
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:10.320
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1070
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:15.380
<v Speaker 2>does that mean that you're afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your imagination or are you afraid of </v>

1071
00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:17.870
<v Speaker 2>the things your imagination represents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1072
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 2>you kind of have to think if there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual objective danger there,</v>

1073
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:23.040
<v Speaker 2>then what you're afraid of is your </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

1074
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you guys ever see the Blair witch </v>

1075
00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.100
<v Speaker 2>project?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of you have seen that?</v>

1076
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.480
<v Speaker 2>How many of you haven't now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a pretty lousy example.</v>

1077
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a horror movie now there's kind of </v>

1078
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:41.360
<v Speaker 2>two kinds of horror movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the splatter type horror movie </v>

1079
00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.870
<v Speaker 2>and I think actually those expose you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>discuss and then there's the fear kind </v>

1080
00:55:45.751 --> 00:55:48.750
<v Speaker 2>of horror movie and that doesn't need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have any Gore at all.</v>

1081
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.130
<v Speaker 2>It just makes you afraid.</v>

1082
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:55.130
<v Speaker 2>And the Blair witch project is very good</v>
<v Speaker 2>example of that because all that </v>

1083
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:55.130
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens,</v>

1084
00:55:55.130 --> 00:56:00.020
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you think something terrible is </v>

1085
00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:02.871
<v Speaker 2>going to happen every second and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that something terrible is going </v>

1086
00:56:02.871 --> 00:56:03.270
<v Speaker 2>to happen keeps climbing through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole movie.</v>

1087
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:08.510
<v Speaker 2>And so what they do is put you in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of radical uncertainty and never </v>

1088
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 2>let you off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1089
00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:14.690
<v Speaker 2>well so basically they're playing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your imagination and that can work very </v>

1090
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:16.400
<v Speaker 2>effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's often horror movies,</v>

1091
00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:21.410
<v Speaker 2>often more effective if they don't show </v>
<v Speaker 2>you what's making those horrible noises </v>

1092
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:22.080
<v Speaker 2>off screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1093
00:56:22.081 --> 00:56:27.081
<v Speaker 2>because no matter what show you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that he can be as </v>

1094
00:56:27.081 --> 00:56:30.151
<v Speaker 2>personally horrible as what are their </v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters you're dredging up out of your </v>

1095
00:56:30.151 --> 00:56:31.930
<v Speaker 2>imagination is very low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1096
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:35.080
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reasonable to be afraid of the dark</v>

1097
00:56:35.081 --> 00:56:37.180
<v Speaker 2>because throughout our biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

1098
00:56:37.181 --> 00:56:42.181
<v Speaker 2>lots of unfortunate people were devoured</v>
<v Speaker 2>by things in the dark or hurt very badly</v>

1099
00:56:42.371 --> 00:56:43.610
<v Speaker 2>by them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1100
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wE're also daytime creatures,</v>

1101
00:56:45.581 --> 00:56:48.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't like the dark very much.</v>

1102
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:53.940
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do to someone if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to initiate them is maybe you take</v>

1103
00:56:54.701 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 2>them when they're 13 and you put them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really dark cave and caves.</v>

1104
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 2>There Are so dark man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in a cave,</v>

1105
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:03.280
<v Speaker 2>you just can't believe how dark it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1106
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.920
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't see anything in a cave.</v>

1107
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:11.610
<v Speaker 2>So you don't know how big the space </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in is and you don't know how </v>

1108
00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:14.881
<v Speaker 2>small it is and you don't know whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not it's going to collapse or when </v>

1109
00:57:14.881 --> 00:57:17.880
<v Speaker 2>it's going to stay up and you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far you are underground,</v>

1110
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.280
<v Speaker 2>especially if the people who took you </v>
<v Speaker 2>there didn't,</v>

1111
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:25.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk you around in circles and didn't </v>

1112
00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.241
<v Speaker 2>let you know where you were going and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe they leave and maybe they </v>

1113
00:57:27.241 --> 00:57:27.241
<v Speaker 2>leave for three days.</v>

1114
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And so you're sitting down there </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

1115
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you thinking?</v>

1116
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1117
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.610
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking the most horrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts you could possibly imagine,</v>

1118
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:38.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to get out of here.</v>

1119
00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:43.980
<v Speaker 2>They're never going to find me again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>some horrible snake thing that lives in </v>

1120
00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:47.761
<v Speaker 2>the darkness is going to come and eat it</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly because fast would be merciful </v>

1121
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:53.050
<v Speaker 2>and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm also going to go completely</v>

1122
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:55.180
<v Speaker 2>out of my mind so that even if something</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't eat me,</v>

1123
00:57:55.181 --> 00:57:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come over here and it will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be worse than being dead anyways.</v>

1124
00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:00.430
<v Speaker 2>And so partly what you're doing in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>

1125
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.860
<v Speaker 2>you're facing that demons of your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>

1126
00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:09.930
<v Speaker 2>And if you can stand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you grow up and that's what an </v>

1127
00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:13.321
<v Speaker 2>initiation ceremony tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now a lot of what you'll find if you </v>

1128
00:58:13.321 --> 00:58:17.521
<v Speaker 2>look at clinical theories of psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same motif applies if you want to </v>

1129
00:58:18.551 --> 00:58:23.551
<v Speaker 2>get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to find out what you're </v>

1130
00:58:23.551 --> 00:58:25.621
<v Speaker 2>avoiding and what you're afraid of and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe what you're disgusted by evil and </v>

1131
00:58:25.621 --> 00:58:30.001
<v Speaker 2>you have to expose yourself to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily and you have to let that </v>

1132
00:58:30.071 --> 00:58:32.950
<v Speaker 2>change you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not a pleasant prospect.</v>

1133
00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:38.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not dancing through a field of </v>

1134
00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:38.130
<v Speaker 2>daisies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1135
00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:41.350
<v Speaker 2>With muzak play and it'S not follow your</v>
<v Speaker 2>bliss.</v>

1136
00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:46.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the natural unfolding of a </v>

1137
00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:46.860
<v Speaker 2>positive process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that at all.</v>

1138
00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:50.140
<v Speaker 2>It's the voluntary confrontation with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that make up life's horrors.</v>

1139
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.370
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1140
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:56.590
<v Speaker 2>there's an idea there that lurks under </v>
<v Speaker 2>the surface architecturally,</v>

1141
00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:00.010
<v Speaker 2>and that is there's a lot more to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>than meets the eye,</v>

1142
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:02.910
<v Speaker 2>but it won't be released unless it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1143
00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:08.700
<v Speaker 2>And so you don't have to even figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is until you put yourself in </v>

1144
00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:08.700
<v Speaker 2>peril.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1145
00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:11.110
<v Speaker 2>part of that you might think like </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you're.</v>

1146
00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:13.270
<v Speaker 2>You're an introvert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're socially awkward.</v>

1147
00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:18.271
<v Speaker 2>You're highly neurotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you feel a lot of anxiety and </v>

1148
00:59:18.271 --> 00:59:20.581
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like going to partieS and </v>

1149
00:59:20.581 --> 00:59:21.110
<v Speaker 2>that's because the horrible tyrant lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>at parties and always glaring at you and</v>

1150
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:24.410
<v Speaker 2>judging you and telling you how useless </v>
<v Speaker 2>and insufficient you are.</v>

1151
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:29.740
<v Speaker 2>And so you go there and you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at people because you know that if </v>

1152
00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:34.001
<v Speaker 2>you did look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just see the face of the judgmental </v>

1153
00:59:34.001 --> 00:59:34.001
<v Speaker 2>tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

1154
00:59:34.001 --> 00:59:34.760
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't if you actually looked at </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1155
00:59:34.761 --> 00:59:39.761
<v Speaker 2>but you won't because you avoid and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go there and you're </v>

1156
00:59:39.761 --> 00:59:40.100
<v Speaker 2>going to put yourself in this terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

1157
00:59:40.101 --> 00:59:41.930
<v Speaker 2>And if you're lucky and you're a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>

1158
00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:46.960
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to incorporate all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of information from the external </v>

1159
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:50.561
<v Speaker 2>world that will help you develop your </v>
<v Speaker 2>social skills and make you more </v>

1160
00:59:50.561 --> 00:59:50.561
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated.</v>

1161
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.490
<v Speaker 2>And even if that doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to learn that.</v>

1162
00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:55.220
<v Speaker 2>You can tolerate your own fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>

1163
00:59:55.221 --> 01:00:00.221
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's better to not be afraid or to </v>

1164
01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:03.380
<v Speaker 2>know that you can handle being afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>and obviously to not be afraid,</v>

1165
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:08.980
<v Speaker 2>but give that up because that ain't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening so that the next best thing </v>

1166
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.020
<v Speaker 2>and the realistic thing is to know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the master of your own fear.</v>

1167
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:18.100
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of what we're going to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about in relationship to classical </v>

1168
01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.450
<v Speaker 2>theories of personality is exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that the world isn't terrible,</v>

1169
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.280
<v Speaker 2>is that the world is terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're a lot stronger than you think</v>

1170
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:26.510
<v Speaker 2>and the way you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1171
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:31.511
<v Speaker 2>And so part of that is the strength that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gather is partly the information </v>

1172
01:00:31.511 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 2>that you gather when you go somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're not good at.</v>

1173
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:38.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're establishing new skills like </v>

1174
01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:38.050
<v Speaker 2>you haven't university.</v>

1175
01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:39.410
<v Speaker 2>But there's another part that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting that's related to the little</v>

1176
01:00:39.411 --> 01:00:41.060
<v Speaker 2>video that I showed you at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

1177
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Dna turns out to be a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

1178
01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:49.040
<v Speaker 2>And so if I put you in situation a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then dna codes,</v>

1179
01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:54.041
<v Speaker 2>certain kinds of proteins that help make</v>
<v Speaker 2>up the way that your mind is in the way </v>

1180
01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:54.950
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I take you and put you in another</v>

1181
01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:57.770
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different genes turn on,</v>

1182
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:03.700
<v Speaker 2>and so what that means is that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a biological repository of potential use</v>

1183
01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:09.850
<v Speaker 2>lying dormant at the highest resolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of your molecular structure.</v>

1184
01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.760
<v Speaker 2>And then if you push yourself and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of different directions and you </v>

1185
01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.910
<v Speaker 2>find different things to pursue and test</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself against,</v>

1186
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:22.060
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to turn on parts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that aren't currently on and </v>

1187
01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.720
<v Speaker 2>god only knows what you'd be like if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned yourself completely on.</v>

1188
01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.420
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I could use a better metaphor.</v>

1189
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:52.580
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a little bit more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shavano routines because they're </v>

1190
01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:52.580
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1191
01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.710
<v Speaker 2>if there is a initiation archetype which</v>
<v Speaker 2>are kind of just described to you,</v>

1192
01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:58.330
<v Speaker 2>which is you can do this to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll Tell you,</v>

1193
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.420
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a good way to live.</v>

1194
01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:02.530
<v Speaker 2>It beats the alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone?</v>

1195
01:02:02.531 --> 01:02:07.531
<v Speaker 2>So which is like the definition of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good way to live so mad and you're </v>

1196
01:02:07.531 --> 01:02:08.430
<v Speaker 2>trying to pursue something so you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>a goal.</v>

1197
01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:13.460
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to have a goal and you don't </v>

1198
01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:13.460
<v Speaker 2>want to hold onto that too tightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he might be wrong.</v>

1199
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.170
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be willing to let that go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have a different goal,</v>

1200
01:02:16.171 --> 01:02:19.290
<v Speaker 2>but you need to go and then you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you're pursuing the goal,</v>

1201
01:02:19.291 --> 01:02:24.291
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find out that there's some obstacles in </v>

1202
01:02:24.291 --> 01:02:25.050
<v Speaker 2>your path obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe some of those obstacles are of</v>

1203
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:30.051
<v Speaker 2>a frightening time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe they're even have a disgusting </v>

1204
01:02:30.051 --> 01:02:30.051
<v Speaker 2>type.</v>

1205
01:02:30.051 --> 01:02:32.750
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to turn into that kind of </v>

1206
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.851
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so those of you who are sort of </v>

1207
01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:37.161
<v Speaker 2>socialist utopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left wingers might think that way about </v>

1208
01:02:37.161 --> 01:02:37.161
<v Speaker 2>business people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1209
01:02:37.161 --> 01:02:41.271
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would recommend that you get over it </v>

1210
01:02:41.271 --> 01:02:41.271
<v Speaker 2>as rapidly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

1211
01:02:41.271 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 2>you might think there's no way I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to act that way.</v>

1212
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:48.321
<v Speaker 2>So you sort of put it off limits saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe you're afraid to do what you </v>

1213
01:02:48.571 --> 01:02:50.340
<v Speaker 2>need to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1214
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.520
<v Speaker 2>here's the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't avoid doing things because they </v>

1215
01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:00.381
<v Speaker 2>make you feel negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have to do those things in order </v>

1216
01:03:00.381 --> 01:03:00.540
<v Speaker 2>to pursue your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1217
01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:05.541
<v Speaker 2>you should do exactly the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're pursuing a goal and </v>

1218
01:03:05.541 --> 01:03:06.630
<v Speaker 2>you find that you're afraid about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and so you're avoiding it.</v>

1219
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:10.140
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you should think is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot look.</v>

1220
01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of something and I'm avoiding</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1221
01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Dragon treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly there.</v>

1222
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:19.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's precisely right.</v>

1223
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:22.080
<v Speaker 2>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're afraid of the thing,</v>

1224
01:03:22.081 --> 01:03:27.081
<v Speaker 2>then what that means is that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed enough to handle it and you </v>

1225
01:03:27.081 --> 01:03:30.231
<v Speaker 2>need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you should think about that as a </v>

1226
01:03:30.231 --> 01:03:30.231
<v Speaker 2>discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a positive discovery.</v>

1227
01:03:30.231 --> 01:03:33.690
<v Speaker 2>You found out where you have a weakness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're now able to address it.</v>

1228
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.450
<v Speaker 2>So you know if you're an introvert and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think it's friday night,</v>

1229
01:03:36.451 --> 01:03:38.670
<v Speaker 2>I could go to this party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know I really don't want to.</v>

1230
01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1231
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:44.400
<v Speaker 2>that means I should go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly right because</v>

1232
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:55.070
<v Speaker 2>because you already know how to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you know how to do and it's </v>

1233
01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:57.540
<v Speaker 2>the things that you don't know how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bother you and oppress you.</v>

1234
01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:59.790
<v Speaker 2>And of course those things are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be difficult to learn about,</v>

1235
01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:04.791
<v Speaker 2>but you need to learn about them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to get yourself all switched </v>

1236
01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:04.860
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that switched on?</v>

1237
01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Because then you'll be able to tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that life is fundamentally </v>

1238
01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.130
<v Speaker 2>suffering and so you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world doesn't get safer us.</v>

1239
01:04:14.131 --> 01:04:16.020
<v Speaker 2>You developed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact quite the contrary.</v>

1240
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:21.170
<v Speaker 2>You just get more competent and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>better anyways because it's conceivable </v>

1241
01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:23.670
<v Speaker 2>that you don't want safety anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably want adventure.</v>

1242
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.840
<v Speaker 2>You probably want to be compelled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably want to be engaged.</v>

1243
01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:29.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want security,</v>

1244
01:04:29.191 --> 01:04:34.191
<v Speaker 2>you might as well be dead well because </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing's happening then and that </v>

1245
01:04:34.191 --> 01:04:37.950
<v Speaker 2>there's no danger to be alive is to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>contending with the world and you want </v>

1246
01:04:39.241 --> 01:04:44.241
<v Speaker 2>to be the best you can possibly be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly what we're going to </v>

1247
01:04:44.241 --> 01:04:46.200
<v Speaker 2>learn about as we go through the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>

1248
01:04:46.201 --> 01:04:51.201
<v Speaker 2>But certainly the elements that have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with clinical psychology because all </v>

1249
01:04:51.201 --> 01:04:52.860
<v Speaker 2>of them circulate around this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental fee.</v>

1250
01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:57.920
<v Speaker 2>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's the fundamental story of </v>

1251
01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.841

<v Speaker 2>fundamental story is because we're all </v>

1252
01:04:59.841 --> 01:05:02.430
<v Speaker 2>human and you need to know the story and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you can decide how you're going to act </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out,</v>

1254
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:07.050
<v Speaker 2>but at least you need to know the damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>story first.</v>

1255
01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:10.110
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see you.</v>
