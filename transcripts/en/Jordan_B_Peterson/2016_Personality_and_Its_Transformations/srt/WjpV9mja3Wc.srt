1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,990
Okay,
so we're actually going to take a step 

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,090
back.
Historically,

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,740
doctor both Carl Rogers last time as a 
phenomenologist,

4
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:20,640
so we started our brief foray into the 
ideas behind phenomenology,

5
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:25,641
but now we're going to go back in time 
and VIP and we're going to talk about 

6
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:29,240
the end of the 19th century and we're 
going to discuss Nietzsche and 

7
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:34,521
Dostoevsky and character guard in some 
detail and the reason we're going to do 

8
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:36,720
that is because those three men,
I,

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,660
I would say more than anyone else in the
19th century,

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,170
laid the groundwork not only for what 
would become psychoanalysis and then 

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,910
later personality psychology and 
clinical psychology,

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,590
but they also describe the broader 
social,

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,830
political and cultural situation that 
modern people find themselves in now and

14
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,050
their thought is exceedingly 
sophisticated and it's really worth 

15
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,400
grasping.
Because if you can get it,

16
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,870
you know we're going through these 
personality theories one of the time and

17
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:16,650
we're making going to make forays into 
biology and neuro psychology.

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,120
You need a structure underneath that.
You need to understand a structure 

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,270
that's underneath all of that to slot 
everything into.

20
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:29,271
Because that way you can understand it 
in more detail and so partly because 

21
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:34,110
ideas develop historically and also as 
an idea,

22
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:39,111
as a seed and the seed,
other plants grow and so forth and the 

23
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:40,470
plant grows and so forth and branches 
off.

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,720
If you can get back down to the origin 
point,

25
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,230
then you can often understand the entire
structure more straightforwardly and 

26
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,130
also these three men are so brilliant 
that it's a joy to encounter their 

27
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,760
thinking even though it's very,
very subversive.

28
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,570
Seriously diverse.
So we're gonna start with this diagram 

29
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:09,210
which you will remember.
So okay.

30
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,750
You're so think about this from the pit 
of perspective,

31
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,500
like we made the point that as the child
puts itself,

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,560
let's say together,
it starts by practicing micro routines,

33
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,910
micro molder,
routines,

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,500
and those are accompanied by perceptual 
frameworks and also they're incorporated

35
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:33,501
into a motivational value system because
they're motivated actions and then the 

36
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:35,880
child practices sequencing.

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Those micro personalities will say 
together to make ever more and more 

38
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,760
complex and ever more and more 
integrated macro personalities.

39
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,760
And so that's basically what this 
diagram describes.

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,420
We were looking at it from an adult 
perspective.

41
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,770
So you know if you're going to be a good
person,

42
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,130
you can decompose being a good person 
into sub of being a good person and you 

43
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,851
can decode it,
so being a good person is an abstract 

44
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:06,760
ideal,
but as you move closer and closer to the

45
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:10,690
point where the goodness is manifested 
in action,

46
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:15,691
you move closer and closer to actual 
movements in the world and so the 

47
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:18,250
abstract category good person is 
actually made out of.

48
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,550
You can think about it as a very complex
melody of motor motor actions and 

49
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,741
perceptions.
Perception is very tightly linked to 

50
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:28,741
motor action because whenever you 
perceive anything,

51
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:33,720
you're doing it in part by actively 
investigating world is partly why your 

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,570
eyes are moving around all the time and 
if you're listening,

53
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,000
you move your head and touch something.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You have to actively investigate it.
So it's always an activity of 

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,761
exploration.
Now in some ways when you think about 

56
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,560
the child piecing,
it's.

57
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,440
It's being together from the bottom up.
You can think about that as a biological

58
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,020
process unfolding.
You know,

59
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,060
and you can take up the child is 
crawling and then learning to walk as a 

60
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,190
biological process unfolding,
but that's an oversimplification because

61
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,060
human beings exist from day one in a 
very,

62
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:12,061
very social world.
And so what that means is the way that 

63
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:16,261
those behaviors are sub micro 
personalities start to organize 

64
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:18,990
themselves is always under the influence
of,

65
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,060
of the society in which they're 
embedded.

66
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,830
And so,
you know,

67
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,950
Piaget talked about the child as,
as,

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,630
as being,
uh,

69
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,530
as,
as having reflex basic built in reflex 

70
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:37,970
is at birth,
and that,

71
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,020
that,
those reflexes are then elaborated up 

72
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,020
into more and more complex structures.

73
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,500
But you can think that even the 
elaboration of those basic reflexes,

74
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:49,501
even right from the beginning,
like there's a routing and sucking 

75
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:49,501
reflex,
which you can,

76
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:52,030
you can listen from a child by tapping 
on the side of it's cheap when it's very

77
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:57,031
new,
newly born and it'll search to try to 

78
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:57,031
put what's tapping in its mouth.
And that's,

79
00:04:57,031 --> 00:05:00,400
that's a,
that's part of the reflection process.

80
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:05,401
The built in perceptual motor unit that 
allows the child to begin to cycle.

81
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,220
Now the thing is though,
what it suckling isn't a static and 

82
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,090
objective entity,
it's a person and part of breastfeeding 

83
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,140
is the establishment of a relationship,
a complex relationship,

84
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:19,240
because it's also not only a feeding 
relationship,

85
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:24,241
it's a caring relationship.
It's a relationship that's based on 

86
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,680
tactile interaction.
There can be nervousness associated with

87
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:27,350
it.
Uh,

88
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,870
and,
and often is,

89
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,300
especially for a new mother,
it's a very complex,

90
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,740
dynamic social act.

91
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,440
And so what that means is that right 
from the beginning,

92
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:39,760
in order for the baby to engage in that 
process properly,

93
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,300
it has to allow its initial reflexive 
movements to be modified by social 

94
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:50,440
necessity immediately.
So for example,

95
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,420
if a baby is breastfeeding,
it can't bite and you know,

96
00:05:55,421 --> 00:06:00,421
it doesn't have any teeth.
So being isn't necessarily a 

97
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:00,590
catastrophe,
but it's not pleasant.

98
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,470
And so what will happen if the baby 
bites the mother is that the mother will

99
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,340
pull away and startle the baby and then 
the baby will cry and you know,

100
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:11,090
the father will be at least startled by 
the,

101
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,700
by the error.
And so the baby has to learn to you.

102
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,110
It has to learn to be civilized in some 
sense.

103
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:23,111
Right off the bat.
Now you know when Freud was talking 

104
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:25,571
about the process of socialization,
he tended to concentrate more on toilet 

105
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,210
training.

106
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,660
No,
because he thought of that as the first 

107
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,240
place were the first major place where 
the ID of the child,

108
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:37,241
which which or which Rogers would regard
as an organismic as the organismic.

109
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,600
A experiential domain is brought under 
control of the superego.

110
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,620
Right?
Because of the baby.

111
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,150
Obviously it's fundamental biological 
function is to relieve itself,

112
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,720
but that has to come under very,
very strict social control and it's a.

113
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,790
it's a complex form of learning which 
basically the acquisition of voluntary 

114
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,380
control over what was here too for an 
involuntary reflex essentially,

115
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,830
and so that can go well or it can go 
badly and it can very well go very 

116
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,300
badly.
So I knew a family who had a daughter at

117
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:16,301
one point and that daughter would only 
dedicate in her diaper when she was 

118
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:20,831
three.
So that meant she had full of voluntary 

119
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,081
control of her bowel function,
but there was no way she was going to 

120
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:26,030
participate in the social ritual that 
surrounded proper toilet.

121
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,340
There was a war going on like a serious 
war and that sort of thing happens while

122
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:36,341
not infrequently.
And of course you remember in the crumb 

123
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:36,341
movie,
the mother,

124
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,130
the boys accusing the mother of giving 
them enemas and her of course denying 

125
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,451
that any such thing happened,
which was something that made both of 

126
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:46,451
them roll their eyes,
you know,

127
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:50,470
and they all laughed,
but it's really not particularly 

128
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:50,840
amusing.
So anyways,

129
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:54,830
my point is is that even at the micro 
level,

130
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,310
the manifestation of what we'll call 
micro personalities expands and 

131
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,580
organizes into an environment that's 
conditioned by social expectation.

132
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,270
Okay.
So then then,

133
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,640
and this is something we haven't talked 
about before,

134
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,550
one thing you might ask is,
okay,

135
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,640
where does the social expectation come 
from?

136
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,750
Now that's a very complex question 
because in some sense that's the same 

137
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,780
question as that as where does culture 
come from?

138
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,140
And that's partly a complex question 
because you have to take into account 

139
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,120
evolutionary history which provides the 
substrata for the development of 

140
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,921
culture.
So that would be human biology of take 

141
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:39,320
that into account and then you have to 
take human history into account and,

142
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,220
and we're what you don't have to take 
into account is not clear,

143
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,230
right?
Because it's very difficult to,

144
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,590
to track the origins of the social 
routines that make up the fundamental 

145
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,360
social contract.
You know,

146
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,470
we know how to behave properly.
Roughly speaking.

147
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,680
We have a set of expectations and a set 
of wants for about the way that other 

148
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,370
people are going to behave with regards 
to us.

149
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,380
And they returned the favor and everyone
is participating in this and everybody 

150
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,490
basically knows,
unless they're very poorly socialized,

151
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,910
you can usually tell that right away.
You know,

152
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,970
kids can tell that because if a three 
year old is playing with another three 

153
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,421
year old and one of them is poorly 
socialized and so maybe has the 

154
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,930
behavioral repertoire of a fairly badly 
behaved two year old.

155
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,500
The other three year old being socially 
sophisticated will say,

156
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,590
will not play with the first one,
so even though they might be perfectly 

157
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,750
happy to play for a time with an actual 
two year old,

158
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:38,270
so it doesn't take very long.
It's really about the age of three.

159
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,370
The children are already sophisticated 
enough to have embodied the rules that 

160
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:48,591
constitute appropriate cultural behavior
and those rules are there patterns 

161
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:53,901
actually for the exactly rules for the 
child because the child couldn't 

162
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:55,500
explicitly state them,
but they can act them out.

163
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:58,380
Now you remember now,
Piaget talked about this a fair bit,

164
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:03,381
right?
Because he said that part of the way 

165
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:06,351
that the slightly larger micro 
personality say have a two year old are 

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
integrated into the broader social world
is through games that are played with 

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,560
peers and with older children and the 
games are ways that like a game is 

168
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,880
fundamentally a negotiated.

169
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,120
It's a negotiated sphere of action and 
perception that has a particular goal 

170
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,950
and the goal is defined by the players 
and the sphere of interaction is defined

171
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,050
by the players.
And so then if you're a good player,

172
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:39,051
what happens is that you become part of 
a higher order structure and the 

173
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:41,070
hierarchy structure is the game.
So if you're playing soccer,

174
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,250
all of a sudden if you're civilized,
what you do is you manifest those 

175
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,731
behaviors that are appropriate to play 
soccer and you subordinate your 

176
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:54,501
voluntarily subordinate,
your individuality at that point to the 

177
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:56,790
higher order structure of the game.
That's a communal agreement.

178
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:01,791
So it's a basic social contract.
And so you practice being part of basic 

179
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:07,191
social contracts by playing games.
And you can do that with games that are 

180
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:11,450
in some sense relatively straightforward
and regulated by strict conventions and 

181
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:17,991
articulated rules.
And so that would be like a soccer game 

182
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:19,650
or you can do it in a more complex way 
and a less,

183
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,920
a less,
a less structured and less articulated 

184
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:27,090
manner by engaging in dramatic play.

185
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,600
And so what children usually do when 
they're doing that is that they'll 

186
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:32,600
gather around a little group and 
they'll,

187
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,910
they'll lay out the drama.
So drama would be,

188
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:40,380
we're going to simulate x,
we're going to simulate a family.

189
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,250
And then everybody is assigned a role 
and so you're supposed to act out your 

190
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,941
role,
but exactly how you're supposed to act 

191
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,551
it out is left open during the games so 
you can riff and improvise and basically

192
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:58,801
what children are doing when they're 
doing that is acting out the family and 

193
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:04,411
you know,
because they need to get the family in 

194
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:06,151
their bones.
Because being a parent isn't a set of 

195
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,140
ideas about parenting.
It's a set of behaviors.

196
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:12,370
It's a dance that you learn to have with
your children and with your partner.

197
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,520
And it's very complicated and the rules 
go far beyond what you could ever 

198
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,100
articulate,
you know,

199
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,720
because you can ask yourself a question 
like,

200
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,790
well,
how should you discipline a child?

201
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,780
Well,
first of all,

202
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,690
you can argue about that forever,
but second of all,

203
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,090
you cannot actually elaborate a set of 
principles that will guide your behavior

204
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:36,091
in every situation where a child is 
likely to disrupt the social 

205
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:39,751
circumstance.
So you have to be smarter than you can 

206
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:41,890
say in order to be good at doing 
something as complicated as disciplining

207
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:42,860
a child.
Now,

208
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,800
because discipline also means 
encouraging,

209
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,410
right?
Because it's part of discipline as well,

210
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,440
you shouldn't do those things,
but another part of it is you should 

211
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,411
definitely do more of those things and 
so it's the inculcation of a moral code 

212
00:12:55,421 --> 00:13:00,421
and a lot of that's done through 
nonverbal behavior and through providing

213
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:06,181
a role model for spontaneous invitation 
and all sorts of things that aren't 

214
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:07,390
verbal.
Okay.

215
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:09,970
Now,
so,

216
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,950
so piaget talked about the game and then
you could take the games become more and

217
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:19,951
more complex and more and more abstract 
and more and more like real life as you 

218
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:21,450
mature until they.

219
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,530
They may be the games transform into 
what sociologists would refer to as 

220
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,580
roles.
So the role you're playing at the moment

221
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:33,581
that at least in principle is student 
and you know it's a game and it's a game

222
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:36,850
because it's a fiction in some sense,
you know,

223
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:39,700
it's a fiction.
It's a dramatic fiction in some sense.

224
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:44,701
The only reason that it exists as a role
is because society is structured in such

225
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:50,401
a way that enables.
This too enables you to do what you're 

226
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:52,990
doing and to live at the same time.
So it's not exactly how to outpatient to

227
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,810
the normal,
to the natural world in any sense of the

228
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,020
in any sense of the word,
but it's also,

229
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,230
it's also real life or maybe it's almost
as close to real life as you ever get 

230
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,190
because almost everything that modern 
people do,

231
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,890
and maybe this is true for a long time 
into the past,

232
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,820
his game like in its structure,
so the game's just get more and more and

233
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:13,300
more.

234
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,270
There's more and more and more 
encompassing in some sense.

235
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:18,940
But you can,
you can almost.

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You can almost say that it never comes 
to the point where what you're doing is 

237
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,511
no longer playing the game.
Now that's a bit of an 

238
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:28,480
oversimplification,
but because there are games and games,

239
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,880
but we won't talk about the games at the
moment.

240
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,690
Okay.
So now you can understand sort of some 

241
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,860
of the lower order games and you can 
even understand some of the higher order

242
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,120
roles.
Like you,

243
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,570
you could basically articulate in some 
sense what it means to be a student.

244
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,190
But if you go up the hierarchy,
you know,

245
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,360
because good person,
a subset of good person could be good 

246
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,560
student.
You can kind of articulate what it means

247
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:54,770
to be a good student,
although you can't fully articulate it,

248
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,370
but if you go at levels above that,
like be a good citizen or be a good 

249
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:05,141
person,
but gets more and more difficult to 

250
00:15:05,141 --> 00:15:07,331
fully articulate because of course it's 
more and more abstract and in 

251
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:11,161
encompasses more and more territory and 
so by the time you're at the top of the 

252
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,620
hierarchy,
so to speak,

253
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,090
be a good person.

254
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,980
Well,
it's much.

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,040
It's a much more complex phenomena than 
you can articulate.

256
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,070
It can't be fully articulated.
Now I want to read you something that 

257
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,070
Nisha said.

258
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:54,310
Now you have to listen to this carefully
because there's some very interesting 

259
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,950
things about the way nature writes.
He's writes a for forest,

260
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,290
an need for Islam is a short statement.
Often only a sentence,

261
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:03,290
but more typically a paragraph.
Next,

262
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:08,291
very,
very densely packed with ideas and I 

263
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,170
think you could say in some sense that 
if you read Nietzsche,

264
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,230
the stuff that I'm going to read right 
now is from beyond good and evil that 

265
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,061
every single sentence has an idea in it 
and it's often an original idea and 

266
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,910
that's a remarkable accomplishment.
I mean I've often gone through books and

267
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:27,911
marked.
I usually fold the top of the page over 

268
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:28,760
mark where I think there is an idea 
worth keeping.

269
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:33,140
It's an idea I haven't run into before.
So it's an original idea and I would say

270
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:36,260
in a typical book I read there's none of
them.

271
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,730
There might be one or two,
but with nature there's probably 20 on a

272
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:43,690
page and so it makes it,
it,

273
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,690
it,
it's.

274
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,470
He's packed a tremendous amount of 
information into a very,

275
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:53,471
very small space and one of the things 
and he tried to do that and there was a 

276
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,280
bunch of reasons.
One was his health wasn't very good,

277
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,820
although he was an early stage genius.
He was a full professor in Germany,

278
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:02,750
I think when he was 22 or 23,
which is impossible because if you don't

279
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:07,751
become a full professor,
especially 130 years ago,

280
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,020
140 years ago in a German University at 
the age of 23,

281
00:17:13,021 --> 00:17:15,770
it just isn't possible,
but he was a spectacular genius,

282
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:20,771
but his health failed him and so he had 
a very difficult time writing and so 

283
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:24,530
what he did was spending an awful lot of
time thinking and a very short period of

284
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:25,190
time writing.

285
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,910
And so what that meant was that he would
take a tremendous amount of thought,

286
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,940
genius level thought and then compress 
it into like a single sentence or a 

287
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,081
single paragraph in and he said that he 
liked to philosophize with a hammer and 

288
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:42,941
in some sense,
you know now you know about hierarchy 

289
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:42,941
that I just showed you.
You know,

290
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:47,680
we talked about the idea that if you hit
something disruptive in your life,

291
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,230
that the magnitude of your response is 
proportionate to the,

292
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,070
to the elevation of the level.
Right?

293
00:17:56,071 --> 00:18:00,390
It's much more damaging to be accused of
being a bad person.

294
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,740
You know,
seriously,

295
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,570
than it is for someone to complain 
about,

296
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,500
you know which side of the plate you 
happen to put the forecourt.

297
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,930
So and I think you can say that you can 
sort of think of those nested 

298
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,280
hierarchies of value as nested 
hierarchies of.

299
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,010
They're almost like maps in the sense 
there their little units of things,

300
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,660
ways that you know how to maneuver in 
the world and not in.

301
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,240
What that means is that as you go up the
hierarchy,

302
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,600
the map is larger and larger and more 
comprehensive and so if you blow out 

303
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,700
someone's map of which fork to put on 
the table,

304
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,830
that's not so bad.
They can just rectify that in no time 

305
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,660
flat.
It leaves 99 point nine,

306
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,890
nine percent of their personality and 
tech.

307
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,170
But if you fail a crucial exam for it,
for example,

308
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:51,171
and part of the reason that you're going
to fit your a student is because you 

309
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,321
want to go to medical school.
You know that'll blow out like 50 or 60 

310
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:55,380
percent of your personality.
Or at least it'll feel that way.

311
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,920
And that's because what's happening is 
that the structure that you use to 

312
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,911
regulate the relationship between you 
and the world has become damaged at a 

313
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:05,340
high level.

314
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,460
And that invalidates,
like if you're not a student,

315
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:12,990
if you're not a good student anymore 
than all of the sub factors that make up

316
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:16,030
being a good student might be invalid.
And you know,

317
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,570
you might've put a lot of effort into 
being a good student.

318
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,640
And so if all of a sudden you're not 
that,

319
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:22,200
you have to ask yourself,
well,

320
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,550
what exactly am I and where are all the 
errors?

321
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,170
And that's a very,
that can be a,

322
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,200
well that's an extraordinary difficult 
cognitive problem because you've built 

323
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,620
that structure who knows,
you know,

324
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,390
over what period of time it might be 15 
years or something like that.

325
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,391
And you'd be practicing building that 
structure and it's a huge part of your 

326
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,120
identity because someone might say,
well,

327
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,400
what are you even?
And you'd say a student,

328
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,170
you know,
they might say,

329
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,910
what do you do?
But they could easily say,

330
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,570
what are you?

331
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,780
I'm a student.
While if you're not a student at least 

332
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,760
in so far as you desire to find student,
then just exactly what are you.

333
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,240
All right.
So nature,

334
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:05,400
you know,
when he packed a lot of information into

335
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:10,401
a sentence or a paragraph,
you have to be very careful reading him 

336
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:13,531
and young is like this too because he'll
throw some information if you that's 

337
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:17,391
packed into a paragraph and it'll be the
kind of information that disrupts high 

338
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:18,600
level structures.
You won't even notice it,

339
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:22,410
but because it's so subversive and he,
he wanted to do that.

340
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:25,110
It was the name of his.
He had his reasons to do it.

341
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,470
He would say that you have to be broken 
down to nothing before you can be 

342
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,461
rebuilt.
So it's like a trip to the underworld 

343
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:34,461
thing.
So,

344
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:36,150
and I suppose in many ways that's what 
philosophy is.

345
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:36,790
You know,
it's,

346
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:42,260
you don't learn a new principal without 
allowing old principles to disappear 

347
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:46,710
because you can't have the new principal
and the old principal at the same time.

348
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,960
So almost always any radical learning 
involves the destruction of old habits 

349
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,970
and have action and perception.
And that's,

350
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:56,890
that's a kind of death,
like it's a,

351
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,220
it's a,
it's an abstract death,

352
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,250
you know,
but at that doesn't make it not painful.

353
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:08,251
And the thing is,
if the abstract is of sufficient 

354
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:11,251
intensity,
it can drive people to suicide because 

355
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:13,780
they regard killing themselves as easier
than making the reparation,

356
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:17,200
you know,
facing the anxiety and the suffering and

357
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,650
going through the intolerably difficult 
task of retooling and they may well 

358
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,150
regard that as more emotionally 
threatening then death.

359
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,090
And so and that,
that's not that rare,

360
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,690
you know,
I mean,

361
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,240
suicide is rare,
but it's not that rare.

362
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,780
So you know,
and it certainly a behavior that 

363
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,971
everyone is.
I suspect everyone here has known 

364
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:40,930
someone who was touched by suicide in 
some way,

365
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,990
you know,
it might not be your family member or 

366
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,240
even your extended family member,
but the probability that you know,

367
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:49,150
someone who knows someone who committed 
suicide is extremely,

368
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,680
extremely likely.
So Nietzsche is a very dangerous,

369
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:58,681
dangerous thinker.
I'm the only person I know who kind of 

370
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:02,490
approaches him and not regard as young.
And Yoga is actually less troublesome 

371
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:07,231
because a lot of what does the NSBE 
offers is his destruction.

372
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,540
It's intelligent,
brilliant destruction,

373
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:15,541
but he doesn't really offer a solution.
He's sort of sketches out the 

374
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:19,951
possibilities of a solution and he died 
young and then in many ways what 

375
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:24,241
happened was that young picked up where 
[inaudible] left off and tried to solve 

376
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:25,360
the problems that need you left 
unsolved,

377
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:26,590
so it was nature,
for example,

378
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,860
in some sense,
along with Dostoevsky who really 

379
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,261
definitively announced the death of God 
at the end of the 19th century in that 

380
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:36,880
left people in some ways bereft of 
belief,

381
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:39,310
and we're going to talk about why that's
so important in a moment.

382
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,460
What union was doing was trying to.
Well,

383
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:47,461
he was trying to rescue the farther from
the underworld in the sense he was 

384
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:50,551
trying.
He tried to go back to the religious 

385
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:52,591
traditions that Nietzsche had had 
described as fatally anachronistic and 

386
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:58,531
demolished by the claims of science.
He attempted to go back to those 

387
00:22:58,531 --> 00:23:01,960
religious traditions and reassess them 
from a psychological perspective to pull

388
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:06,961
back the necessary meaning that was 
embedded in them so that people could 

389
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:10,770
reunite with their culture and in 
principle not be so prone to 

390
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,581
pathological belief systems like 
ideology that tend to rush in where 

391
00:23:14,581 --> 00:23:15,680
there's a gap.
You know,

392
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,720
a niche has said very clearly and and 
Dostoevsky knew this as well by the end 

393
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,040
of the 19th century,
is that the death of God would mean that

394
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:29,041
people would turn on Mohs to 
rationalistic ideologies and that would 

395
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:33,871
be murderous.
They knew that was coming and that's an 

396
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:34,390
amazing prediction,
really is amazing prediction.

397
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,690
It just shows you how thoroughly they 
understood the structure.

398
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Okay,
so I'm going to read you something by 

399
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,371
nature and then we're going to return to
the hierarchy so that you can kind of 

400
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:47,000
understand something deeper about the 
way the hierarchy is structured.

401
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:53,060
Okay?
Now he's talking about philosophical 

402
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,740
ideas here and he's actually talking 
about articulated ethics.

403
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,130
So one way that you might think about 
philosophy is that philosophers or 

404
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,480
originate articulated moral principles,
and that is often the way that people 

405
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:08,990
think about especially moral philosophy.
It's like it's the philosophers who come

406
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,030
up with the ideas,
but that isn't what needs you believe.

407
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,940
Here's what he said.
Instead,

408
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,210
separate philosophical ideas are not 
anything optional or autonomously 

409
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,440
evolving.

410
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,580
They grow up in connection and 
relationship with each other.

411
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:33,510
However,
suddenly an arbitrarily they seem to 

412
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,890
appear in the history of thought.
They nevertheless belong just as much to

413
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,850
assist them as the collective members of
the fauna of a continent.

414
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,310
Okay?
So it's a very interesting idea.

415
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:46,330
So the first idea that he's putting 
forward is that you could.

416
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,150
The best way to think about a 
philosophical system,

417
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:54,270
say a philosophical system of ethics is 
as if it's different statements are 

418
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,760
animals related to one another in an 
ecosystem.

419
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,940
So he has a biological metaphor in some 
sense,

420
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:02,050
for,
for,

421
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,300
for the emergence of a philosophical 
system.

422
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,950
It's quite an interesting way of 
thinking,

423
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:10,951
of course,
and it makes sense because if a 

424
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:14,520
philosophical system of ethics,
which is a philosophical system that 

425
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,420
tells you how and why you should behave 
a certain way is about how you should 

426
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,710
act and you're a biological being,
then of course,

427
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:24,910
it only makes sense that the concepts 
themselves which are guides to actions,

428
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,210
can logically be considered biological 
entities.

429
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,820
They're abstracted biological entities,
but they still have the same nature as 

430
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,330
biological entities and that means 
according to meet you,

431
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:39,460
that they're subject to the same rules.
Now,

432
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:42,850
this is the sort of place where he 
foreshadows Freud deeply,

433
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,080
so

434
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,340
nature says

435
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:54,300
they never little last belong just as 
much to assist them as the collective 

436
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:54,700
members of the forerunner of a 
continent.

437
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,460
This is be treated in the end by the 
circumstance.

438
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,800
However,
unfailingly,

439
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,130
the most diverse philosophers always 
fill in,

440
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,800
again,
a definite fundamental schema.

441
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,620
Possible philosophies under an invisible
spell.

442
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:12,460
They always resolved once more in the 
same orbit.

443
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,290
However,
independent of each other,

444
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:17,500
they may feel themselves with their 
critical or systematic wills.

445
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,120
Something within them leads them 
something impels them indefinite order.

446
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:27,150
The one after the other to wit the 
innate methodology in relationship of 

447
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,501
their ideas,
their thinking is in fact far less a 

448
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:33,360
discovery then direct than a 
rerecognition,

449
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:38,490
a remembering a return and a homecoming 
to a far off ancient common household of

450
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:43,801
the soul out of which these ideas 
formerly group philosophizing so far,

451
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:46,560
it kind of activism of the highest 
order.

452
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,320
Okay,
so here,

453
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,390
here's the idea.
There's,

454
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,210
there's two fundamental ideas that are 
embedded in this,

455
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,860
which actually neat.
You differentiates.

456
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:20,030
Alright,
I'm going to read you another section 

457
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,030
that illuminates the first one.

458
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,920
It's gradually became clear to me what 
every great philosophy up till now has 

459
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,341
consisted of namely the confession of 
its originator and a species of 

460
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:35,161
involuntary and unconscious 
autobiography and moreover that the 

461
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:39,811
moral or immoral purpose in every 
philosophy has constituted the true 

462
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:41,740
vital germ out of which the entire plant
has always grown.

463
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,020
Okay?
So this is a very radical statement.

464
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:47,120
So because what Nietzsche is saying is 
that philosophies,

465
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,180
even when they declare themselves 
rational,

466
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,540
are deeply personal and they're also 
necessarily embedded within a 

467
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:58,330
motivational structure that is either 
pro or anti life,

468
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,590
something like that.
So there's no value free philosophizing.

469
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,130
What there is is the expression of 
biologically and culturally conditioned 

470
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:12,391
being which is conditioned by let's say,
the same sort of fundamental forces that

471
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,300
Freud described in the in the in the 
biological realm,

472
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,020
and then that's conditioned by the 
cultural processes that we just 

473
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,681
discussed in relationship to piaget and 
then what the philosopher does is 

474
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:27,370
observe that all of those things are 
happening.

475
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,530
Allow that to be articulated and confuse
that with his own thought.

476
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,700
That's a brilliant idea.
Now here's a way of thinking about it.

477
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:42,570
Now,
one of the things Piaget said was that 

478
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,240
once children start to play games,
when they're young,

479
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,960
collective games,
you can watch the children play the 

480
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,261
collective games like maybe eight kids 
are playing marbles or something like 

481
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:53,140
that,
and then you can take the young kids out

482
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:56,080
of the game and you can ask them what 
the rules are.

483
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,320
And what will happen is you'll get a 
diverse set of diverse and paradoxical 

484
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:06,451
set of articulated rules.
And what that means is that the children

485
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,880
can play the game when they're in the 
game and we're in there in the context 

486
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,451
of all the other people because in some 
sense the game is embedded in pieces in 

487
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:17,350
all of them and as long as they're all 
there,

488
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,130
that all works.

489
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:23,130
But if you pull the child the way they 
don't have the intellectual wherewithal 

490
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,090
to do,
describe the patterns of behavior that 

491
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,091
make up the game.
And that's only to say that they know 

492
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:30,670
things that they can't say because you 
might say,

493
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:31,570
well,
the game,

494
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,110
the rules of the game come first and 
then the game emerges.

495
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,900
But that's wrong.
It's the game comes first.

496
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,790
And only after that do the rules emerge.
And of course there's,

497
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:46,190
you know,
there's a reciprocal relationship 

498
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:46,270
between them because once the rules are 
somewhat articulated,

499
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,570
then the game becomes more structured,
you know,

500
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:49,010
and,
and,

501
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,400
and the rules can become more structured
and so on.

502
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:56,401
So the articulation changes the rules.
What niche you is saying is the same 

503
00:29:56,401 --> 00:30:00,331
thing applies to societies.
He says like in so far as you can 

504
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:05,341
consider society,
a collective game played by millions of 

505
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:07,450
people over vast spans of time.

506
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:12,430
It's a game of games in some sense,
and it emerged from the bottom up.

507
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,730
It emerged out of biological impulses 
and an interpersonal and social 

508
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:23,041
interactions,
conditioning and shaping everyone's 

509
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:27,690
behavior and perception,
and that happened way before anyone 

510
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,521
could articulate what those rules were.
Now you remember when Nisha was writing,

511
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,450
there was no real sense of how old the 
earth was or how old the universe was 

512
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,830
mean.
People thought even the radical people 

513
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,140
thought maybe in terms of hundreds of 
thousands of years,

514
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:49,590
you know,
and now we know that the universe is 14 

515
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,230
billion years old and that the earth is 
4 billion years old and that life has 

516
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,910
been plentiful on the earth for three 
point 5 billion years.

517
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,940
You know,
so that the historical context within 

518
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,481
which we've originated has expanded by,
by orders of magnitude since the last 

519
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,720
19th century.
And so then what you think that means is

520
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:12,721
that the way that our games have been 
organized stretches impossibly back in 

521
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:14,980
time.

522
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,550
Now I already told you I believe the 
story about lobster dominance,

523
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:19,360
higher fees,
right,

524
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,630
so even lobsters that's 400 million 
years ago,

525
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,960
lobsters arrayed themselves in a social 
space and they regulate each other and 

526
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,230
that means the lobsters essentially have
a lobster society and you know,

527
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,260
each lobster has biological 
predispositions that are quite 

528
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,160
determined.
They're quite a.

529
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,670
The lobster is quite a deterministic 
creature,

530
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,970
but nonetheless,
the way that those biological 

531
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,161
predispositions manifest themselves is 
conditioned and shaped by the social 

532
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:52,390
surrounding.
And so you think,

533
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:57,391
well,
lobsters start to play games for a 

534
00:31:57,391 --> 00:32:01,290
hundred million years ago and you know,
as we've taken the tremendously long 

535
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,900
evolutionary journey across that time,
we'd been playing social games the whole

536
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:09,901
time.
And that means that the way that we 

537
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:12,880
interacted with each other has evolved 
and it's even shaped the way our biology

538
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:15,960
manifests itself because that's how 
we'll culture is.

539
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,210
And then out of that,
as we became more capable of 

540
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:21,210
abstraction.

541
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,800
And maybe that's,
you know,

542
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,590
that's something that really took off 
probably 7 million years ago with modern

543
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:31,591
human beings emerging about 150,000
years ago because we separated from the 

544
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:36,121
common ancestor of peep of human beings 
in chimpanzees about 7 million years 

545
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:40,141
ago.
You can tell that by doing analysis of 

546
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:41,510
genetic differences.
So the brain expanded very rapidly after

547
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:46,511
that point and our culture became more 
and more conscious and articulated and 

548
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:48,740
complex and larger and more 
technological,

549
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,850
you know,
so it became in some ways more dependent

550
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:57,851
on social norms and less dependent on 
deterministic biological 

551
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:01,331
predispositions.
But we've still been doing that for a 

552
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:01,331
very long time.
There's,

553
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:03,070
there's good evidence that,
um,

554
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,710
you know,
we started using fire about 2 million 

555
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:08,710
years ago.
And uh,

556
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,730
forgive me if I told you this already,
but you know,

557
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,850
if you look at a human being and you 
look at a champion z one,

558
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,900
there's a bunch of things you see that 
are very different.

559
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,260
Morphologically,
the chimp is much shorter,

560
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,770
much,
much wider and way more powerful.

561
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:26,690
So like a normal mail chimp is about six
times as strong as the strongest Olympic

562
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:29,420
athlete.
So don't mess with chimps.

563
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,010
They'll tear you apart,
they're really,

564
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,320
really strong and dangerous.
So.

565
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,990
But the chimp is shaped sort of like 
this.

566
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,640
No,
they have a huge gastrointestinal 

567
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:41,640
system,
roughly speaking,

568
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,640
and the reason for that is mostly what 
they eat is leaves and leaves,

569
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:48,641
have no caloric content,
and so they have to eat immense numbers 

570
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:51,620
of leaves and leaves are hard to digest 
so they have to chew them like mad.

571
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:53,870
So the typical chimps sits around eight 
hours a day,

572
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,900
chewing,
and then they have this tremendously 

573
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,940
long gastrointestinal system because it 
takes that long to extract any nutrients

574
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:05,300
out of out of leaves.
While we circumvented that man,

575
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:10,301
as soon as we invented fire and fire 
allowed us to outsource our digestion 

576
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,490
because if you cook most things,
vegetables,

577
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:15,230
but more importantly meet.

578
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,410
If you cook them,
they become much more bioavailable and,

579
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,820
and it takes much less energy to digest 
them.

580
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,560
So that way you can shrink your gut and 
grow your brain.

581
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,370
And so that's apparently what we did 
because here we are,

582
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,540
you know,
relatively slim at least compared to 

583
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,000
chimpanzees and so fire popped up 2 
million years ago.

584
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:37,640
It's a real cultural revolution,
but you know,

585
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,830
that's so old,
that culture revolution,

586
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:42,500
that content completely reshaped our 
bodies.

587
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,350
And so this interplay between biology 
and culture,

588
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:48,530
it's been going on for an unimaginably 
long period of time.

589
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,040
And it conditions everything we do.
Now here's a complicated idea.

590
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,290
Okay,
so imagine a wolf pack.

591
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,100
Now.
Wolf pack is a pretty complex,

592
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,240
complicated social group.
It's,

593
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,500
it's a fair bit like a primordial human 
group,

594
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,550
which is why dogs have been with us for 
25,000

595
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:25,100
years.
Maybe they were walls that first started

596
00:35:25,101 --> 00:35:26,510
to follow us around.
And scabies,

597
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:29,480
or more likely,
I think someone went out,

598
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,850
some primordial hunter,
went out hunting,

599
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:37,180
killed a wolf female,
found the pops and one home for the 

600
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:40,260
children to play with,
you know.

601
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:42,660
And that was the origin,
the origin of the dog.

602
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:45,060
I think it was something like that 
because dogs are basically,

603
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,120
they're basically genetically identical 
with wolves.

604
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,450
Now the thing is is we can get along 
with dogs and the reason we can get 

605
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,140
lauren with dogs,
because dogs have a social organization,

606
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,530
you could call it a dominance hierarchy.
That's a fair bit like the Human Social 

607
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,560
Organization and so you can see that 
part of what it means to be human is the

608
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:08,700
same thing that it means to be a pack 
animal like a dog or a pack animal,

609
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:11,910
like our domesticated horses and cows 
for example,

610
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,490
which we can domesticate partly because 
there are social.

611
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,970
So some of the structure of our social 
organization is the same sort of 

612
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:24,141
structure that an animal dominance 
hierarchy has like a chimpanzee 

613
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:27,801
dominance hierarchy for example.
And so we know that chimpanzees and 

614
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:29,010
other primates,
monkeys for example,

615
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,600
are acutely aware of the levels of 
hierarchy in their social structure.

616
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,910
And there are,
I think it's vervet monkeys.

617
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:40,911
This is a very funny experiment.
So imagine that the top vervet monkeys 

618
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:42,210
are like celebrity monkeys,
you know,

619
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,920
and the bottom vervet monkeys are like,
you know,

620
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:49,970
dissolute street people.
And so then you take some pictures of 

621
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,840
dissolute street people who are just at 
the bottom of the hierarchy and you take

622
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:55,650
some pictures of celebrities and you 
show pictures to a human audience,

623
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:59,370
and the human audience will look at the 
celebrities longer.

624
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:04,730
Well,
if you take the vervet monkeys and you 

625
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,381
take photographs of the top ranking 
vervet monkeys and the bottom vervet 

626
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:09,771
monkeys,
and you showed them to vervet monkeys 

627
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:09,850
than the vervet monkeys will look at the
top ranking Verdun Vervet,

628
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,380
monkey photographs more than the bottom 
ranking vervet monkey photographs.

629
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,380
So in some sense,
they're transfixed by the individuals 

630
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,560
who are higher up in the in the social 
order.

631
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,940
And that makes sense,
right?

632
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:25,941
Because what you should feel,
especially in a fairly aggressive 

633
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,260
dominance hierarchy,
what you should feel,

634
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,260
the closer you are to the bottom of the 
dominance hierarchy,

635
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:36,770
the closer what you should feel for 
whatever's at the top of the dominance 

636
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:37,230
hierarchy.
That should be.

637
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,920
It should be closer and closer to all.
Now,

638
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:45,921
when people feel off,
they get chills running up and down 

639
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:45,921
their back,
their neck,

640
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:50,721
well white.
The reason that happens is because it's 

641
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:50,721
an.
It's an,

642
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:54,050
it's an activism.
It's a hangover from the time that when 

643
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:54,870
you were threatened by something awe 
inspiring,

644
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,300
let's say a snake or a bear or something
like that,

645
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:02,750
your hair would stand up and the reason 
for that is so that you look bigger and 

646
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:06,180
you still see this happening all the 
time with cats right to capsule.

647
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,240
Normally cat's face each other this way,
right?

648
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:14,780
But if they start to fight,
they turned sideways and that so they 

649
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,300
each look bigger than they puff up their
fur and their tail and that's to show 

650
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,770
the other cat that they're really a lot 
bigger than the cat first thought.

651
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:24,771
Now,
of course they're both doing that so 

652
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:24,771
it's a little bit pointless,
but they're just cat.

653
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:28,891
So you know you can give them a break,
but the point is is that the pilot will 

654
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,630
erect and that's the same thing that 
happens.

655
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:35,631
For example,
when you're listening to very powerful 

656
00:38:35,631 --> 00:38:35,631
music and it deeply affects you and you 
get chills.

657
00:38:35,631 --> 00:38:39,100
It's like the hair stands up on the back
of your neck and that's the signaling of

658
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:44,101
all.
Now the reason you should feel odd to 

659
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:46,831
award something that's higher up in the 
dominance hierarchy is because that 

660
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:47,970
thing has power like is there.

661
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Well,
there's more than one reason a that 

662
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,961
thing has power.
You better be careful of it because it 

663
00:38:54,961 --> 00:38:57,451
will put you in your place and fast and 
part of the reason the dominance 

664
00:38:57,451 --> 00:39:00,961
hierarchy exists is so that everybody 
knows their place and they don't have to

665
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:05,320
be reminded of it by being half killed 
on a regular basis.

666
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,640
You know,
so maybe your nine on a scale of one,

667
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,110
one being the top,
maybe your number nine,

668
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,890
it's not so good,
but number nine and not hurting,

669
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:17,980
there's a lot better than number nine in
lying there bleeding on the ground.

670
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,400
And so what happens with dominance 
hierarchies is they usually arrange 

671
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,750
themselves in part by power,
but by no means only empower.

672
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:31,020
Everybody knows where they are and 
pretty much everybody stays there and 

673
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,480
not even happens over multiple 
generations saying in,

674
00:39:32,481 --> 00:39:37,481
in complex primate dominance,
trues statuses heritable so,

675
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:40,420
and you know that there's not much of a 
leap between that.

676
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,280
Inheritable monitor peace among human 
beings.

677
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:43,750
It's a reflection of,
you know,

678
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:48,751
it's much more complex among human 
beings because it's articulated in 

679
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:49,990
structure,
but it's the same basic thing.

680
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,890
Now.
Niches point was so now imagine in that.

681
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Now here's another problem.
So imagine that,

682
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,310
okay,
so you've got a garment,

683
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,320
it's art and it's fairly stable and one 
of the things you want to do is climb to

684
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:16,700
the top of the dominant Turkey.
And the reason you want to do that,

685
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,520
there's all sorts of reasons.
High quality mates,

686
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:22,310
that's the primary reason that's 
particular true in humans.

687
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:27,230
If you're male,
because males are much more differential

688
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:32,231
reproducers that females,
which means a lot of males fail to 

689
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:33,500
reproduce completely and some reproduce 
a lot.

690
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,040
Whereas the typical woman reproduces at 
least some.

691
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,890
So that means competition is more 
intense among men.

692
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:44,891
And that's part of the reason why 
dominance hierarchies tend to be tilted 

693
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:46,100
towards male power because competition 
means more to them.

694
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:51,190
The outcome is more crucial.
So now part of what happens is that as 

695
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:54,020
people compete within the dominance 
hierarchy,

696
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,200
what they're doing is to try to figure 
out who it is that is fit to be on top.

697
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,960
Now you might think that that's a matter
of power,

698
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,010
you know,
in fact,

699
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:12,310
your basic social lefty,
social constructionists would have you 

700
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:12,320
believe that that was all there is to 
it,

701
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:16,250
is that the whole dominance hierarchy is
nothing but a power system.

702
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,430
And the people on top are there because 
they have power and what's there is 

703
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,931
power.
And by that they mean the ability to 

704
00:41:25,931 --> 00:41:25,931
enforce their will on other people.
Well,

705
00:41:25,931 --> 00:41:27,950
that's a,
that's a dopey theory.

706
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,640
And the reason for that is,
is that if unit dimensional,

707
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:32,930
you know,
we,

708
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,980
that people are multifaceted,
there's no single motivation.

709
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:38,280
That's king.
You know,

710
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,300
for Freud it was sex and aggression and 
like if you're going to come up with a 

711
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,150
couple of potent candidates,
those are two.

712
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,110
But there's lots of other ones.
People are playful and play as a primary

713
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:50,120
biological circuit.
You know,

714
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,190
we suffer,
we're hungry,

715
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,170
we're thirsty,
we're affiliative.

716
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:59,530
Like there's a lot of biological 
necessity driving the makeup of our 

717
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:06,881
personalities and there are biological 
subpersonalities into arbitrarily call 

718
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:11,171
one of them.
The source of something as complex as 

719
00:42:11,171 --> 00:42:11,530
social organization is,
it's a.

720
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,830
it's,
it's a,

721
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,890
it's a false form of monotheism.
It's a crazy idea and it's the kind of 

722
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:22,340
idea that only people who really don't 
like to think would have.

723
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,610
Because once you come up with that idea,
it's all power.

724
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,730
You don't have to think anymore.
Someone can say to you,

725
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:33,731
well,
why is complex phenomena x the way it 

726
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:37,061
is?
Why is the economy arranged the way it 

727
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:37,061
is?
Well,

728
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:37,940
it's so that the people at the top can 
maintain their power.

729
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,500
Well,
yeah,

730
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:45,040
sure,
but maybe that accounts for 10 percent 

731
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,650
of the reason it doesn't get close to 
100 percent.

732
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:50,651
There's lots of reasons why hierarchies 
are structured the way they are,

733
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:54,890
and sheer physical force is one of them,
but it's.

734
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,780
It's unstable.
So.

735
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,840
So Frans de Waal,
who was watching chimps organize their 

736
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,160
dominance hierarchies in the zoo in 
Holland,

737
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,940
noted quite quickly that it was fairly 
typical or at least possible for the 

738
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:11,300
meanest,
ugliest,

739
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,660
strongest mail chimp to be the dominant 
guide.

740
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,840
Sometimes it was the chip who learned to
pick up a garbage cameron who act the 

741
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,220
hell out of it with the stick because 
that intimidated his enemies,

742
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:24,030
you know,
so it's a bit of creativity,

743
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,940
creativity there,
but what,

744
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,480
but what they found was that the stable 
hierarchies were never run by barbarian 

745
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,130
chimp dictators.
And the reason for that was that 

746
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,050
coalitions of other males would take 
them out because you know,

747
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,630
you think,
well,

748
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:43,631
if you're,
if you're one of antisocial aggressive 

749
00:43:43,631 --> 00:43:44,420
male in endure tough,
it's like,

750
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,380
okay,
you're tough.

751
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:50,381
But three lesser friendlier males who 
are bound together in a friendship pack,

752
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,010
which chimpanzees form quite intensely.

753
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:59,300
It's like as soon as that guy turns his 
back or has a bad day or gets hurt,

754
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,460
they're going to jump in there and tear 
him to pieces.

755
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:05,840
And that's exactly what happened.
So what below found was that the stabler

756
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:10,930
chimpanzee dominance hierarchies were 
run usually by males who were 

757
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:15,120
affiliative and gregarious who 
remembered their social obligation.

758
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:20,121
So that meant with with regards to their
friendship network and who were also 

759
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:22,850
very good to the females and the infants
in the truth,

760
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,880
even if they weren't his.
And the idea there is that power is an 

761
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,380
unstable basis for the maintenance of a 
dominance hierarchy across time.

762
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,790
Because in some sense,
even among the chips,

763
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:37,050
you have to have the consent of the 
governed because you'll get a revolution

764
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:42,051
otherwise.
And so you know you're going to get a 

765
00:44:42,051 --> 00:44:43,560
revolution if you put people in or 
animals in the situation where they have

766
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:44,760
nothing to lose.

767
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:50,060
And so what that means is there are 
constraints on how you can act well.

768
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:55,821
You try to move up the dominance 
hierarchy system because if you're too 

769
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:58,881
aggressive and selfish and you're not 
grooming anyone else and you're not 

770
00:44:58,881 --> 00:45:00,570
communicating with the other creatures 
in the truth,

771
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,050
they're going to gang up on you and take
you down.

772
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,120
And so if you're going to maneuver your 
way up the true,

773
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:12,530
you have to be do it in a manner that 
civilized enough so that you don't get 

774
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:16,050
every one against you.
And so what it means is that to maneuver

775
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:21,051
up a power hierarchy,
especially a complex power art 

776
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,170
heartbeat,
you have to be a lot more than powerful.

777
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,930
So,
okay,

778
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:29,990
now,
so now we've got this idea that there 

779
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:31,530
are principles governing the movement of
peep,

780
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,590
of creatures up a dominance even among 
the animals,

781
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,500
and one of the defining characteristics 
of the that,

782
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:44,460
that one of the characteristics that 
necessity makes the limit,

783
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:49,461
that process is that overtime the truth 
can't let anybody climb the dominance 

784
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,460
hierarchy who will destabilize the whole
dominance heart.

785
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,040
Because then that's it.
Game over.

786
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,460
So at the very least,
you have to learn how to climb up the 

787
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:01,980
hierarchy so that you don't destabilize 
it while you climb,

788
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,950
because otherwise you get to the top and
there's nothing left.

789
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,200
Well,
and in animals know this,

790
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:09,150
they know this instinctively.
So for example,

791
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:14,151
when wolves go at it first,
they puff up and they'd grow with each 

792
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:17,751
other and they put up their shoulders 
and like they get more and more 

793
00:46:17,751 --> 00:46:21,680
aggressive until attack is imminent and 
often one of them will back off with 

794
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,790
there's no fighting,
no one gets damaged.

795
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,910
And,
and so that's the typical situation.

796
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:28,260
It's like one says,
yeah,

797
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:28,890
okay,
you know,

798
00:46:28,891 --> 00:46:29,330
I'm,
I'm,

799
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,130
I'm out of here.
And God only knows why that is.

800
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:37,310
Often I suspect the wolf with the higher
serotonin level winds because it has 

801
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,150
less negative emotion.
And Sarah Donin levels go up as you move

802
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:41,310
up the dominance art now.

803
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,520
And then they'll go into,
you know,

804
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:47,570
they'll actually have a fight,
but the fight usually doesn't last very 

805
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:47,670
long.
And then the loser will roll over,

806
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,070
throw itch,
show its throat to the winter,

807
00:46:50,071 --> 00:46:52,610
which is quite a behavior because wolves
tear the throats out of,

808
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,940
of,
of their prey.

809
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,150
And the top woeful back off.
And you know,

810
00:46:57,151 --> 00:47:02,151
you think about,
that's unbelievably sophisticated 

811
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:02,400
morality.
You know there there's echos in there of

812
00:47:02,401 --> 00:47:07,401
the New Testament injunction to love 
your enemy because that's exactly what 

813
00:47:07,401 --> 00:47:12,291
the wolf is doing and you know it 
doesn't know this because it can't 

814
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:14,940
articulate the rule,
but what it's doing is acting as if even

815
00:47:14,941 --> 00:47:18,900
the thing that attacked you is valuable 
in its own right.

816
00:47:18,901 --> 00:47:23,400
If it's part of your truth and you know,
you can see there the,

817
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:28,530
the,
the ancient biological origins of the 

818
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:28,530
idea of the,
you know,

819
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:32,940
of the,
of the equality and value of each 

820
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:32,940
individual.

821
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:33,580
So these things have deep,
deep,

822
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:35,590
deep roots.
They're not arbitrary,

823
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,930
they're not arbitrary and no one 
invented them.

824
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:40,000
And that's exactly what Nietzsche is 
saying here.

825
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:45,070
To understand how the abstruse 
metaphysical assertions of a philosopher

826
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,350
have been arrived at,
it is always well.

827
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:52,351
And why is to first ask oneself what 
morality do they or does he aim at?

828
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:58,830
Accordingly?
I do not believe that an impulse to 

829
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:02,131
knowledge is the father of philosophy,
but that another impulse here as 

830
00:48:02,131 --> 00:48:06,091
elsewhere has only made use of knowledge
and mistaken knowledge as an instrument.

831
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,540
But whoever considers the fundamental 
impulses of man with a view to 

832
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:16,951
determining how far they may have here 
acted as inspiring Jeannie or as demons 

833
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:23,490
will find that they have all practiced 
philosophy at one time or another and 

834
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:26,881
that each of them would have only been 
to glad to look upon itself as the 

835
00:48:26,881 --> 00:48:29,680
ultimate end of existence and the 
legitimate lord of over all of the other

836
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:30,370
impulses.

837
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:32,010
So what is he saying there?
Well,

838
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:37,020
you know,
nature makes this explicit in passages 

839
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,681
that are related to this one.
He viewed the human being as a 

840
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:43,651
collection of sub souls and the souls 
were grounded in their existence and in 

841
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:49,290
biological underpinnings.
And that was the case for every human 

842
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:52,591
being in that made us roughly similar.
It certainly made our groups roughly 

843
00:48:52,591 --> 00:48:54,340
similar.
And so these,

844
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,400
each of these biological subsystems 
conceptualized as a sub soul was 

845
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,780
something that had its own viewpoint,
has its own rules,

846
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,760
had its own games,
and they would,

847
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:08,850
they jockey for precedence.
Now you know that because sometimes 

848
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:12,451
you're sitting there reading and you're 
trying to concentrate on a higher order 

849
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:12,730
goal,
like completing your classes.

850
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:17,731
And you know,
some biologically determined subsystem 

851
00:49:17,731 --> 00:49:18,610
pops up and says,
you know,

852
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,010
this would be an excellent time to go 
have a coffee,

853
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:26,650
you know,
and you might do everything you can to 

854
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,020
not allow that thing to take over,
but often it does.

855
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:34,020
And so,
and often that's despite what you think 

856
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,620
you might actually want to do.
And then later you're all upset about it

857
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:38,890
because you've procrastinated yet again.
But you know,

858
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:43,891
nature view the psyche as a place you 
could almost think of yourself as a set 

859
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:49,810
of apps.
It's like your brain is a set of animals

860
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,140
and the animals are all dependent on one
another,

861
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:56,710
but each animal needs to be boss from 
time to time.

862
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:00,580
And each animal wants to be boss more 
often than it should be.

863
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:06,150
And then you know,
the higher order critical systems are 

864
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:10,141
there to figure out how to sequence all 
of these other animals so that they all 

865
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:14,341
get what they need without interfering 
with each other across large spans of 

866
00:50:14,341 --> 00:50:18,730
time in the presence of many other 
people in a manner that's sustaining.

867
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,890
So it's very,
very complicated.

868
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,360
Okay.
Now,

869
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:28,080
so let's go back to the hierarchy so you
have the hierarchy and overtime.

870
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:34,690
Now remember,
this hierarchy stays there for a very 

871
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:37,211
long period of time and remember as well
that the people who climbed to the top 

872
00:50:37,211 --> 00:50:41,771
of the hierarchy are much more likely to
leave offspring than the people who 

873
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:46,361
don't.
And so then what that means is that the 

874
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:49,001
hierarchy in part is one of the primary 
selection forces operating on humanity 

875
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:56,290
and what that means is that we evolve 
towards the thing that can most 

876
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:59,090
successfully climbed the dominance 
heart.

877
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:04,390
And so that means that we evolve towards
the thing that has the best probability 

878
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:09,080
of ruling properly and that that's not 
just cultural.

879
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,940
It's cultural because it's the continual
interplay between cultural and biology.

880
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,770
Going back,
we'll save 400 million years or more.

881
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,060
Okay,
now,

882
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:22,070
but it's even more complicated than 
that.

883
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:27,390
And,
and this is one of the things that you 

884
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:29,951
have to understand if you really want to
understand what niche of meant by the 

885
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:29,951
death of God.

886
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:31,580
So because that's his most famous 
pronouncement,

887
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:36,581
God is dead and we have killed them and 
we'll never find enough water to wash 

888
00:51:36,581 --> 00:51:38,120
away the blood now.
So he wasn't announcing that in triumph.

889
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,820
He was announcing it in terror.
Okay,

890
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:45,620
now imagine this.
So as human society becomes more complex

891
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:50,770
and as our brains become larger and 
larger so that we can track larger 

892
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:54,140
social organizations and we can organize
more complex communities.

893
00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:00,610
What happens is that here to for 
isolated tribes of people come together 

894
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,760
and then they have to engage in conflict
and negotiation and partly what they're 

895
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,410
in conflict about is what is the way 
that you should act and what should the 

896
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:16,421
values be?
Now there's an old mythological idea 

897
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:19,970
that the gods fight in heaven to see who
is the dominant God.

898
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,240
While you can imagine all of these 
individual tribes,

899
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:28,510
they had their ideals and those were 
creatures of their imagination,

900
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,600
but those were imagined representations 
of proper behavioral patterns and they 

901
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:39,701
saw there was this transcendent 10 super
ordinate and so then try bay would come 

902
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:44,651
into contact with tried b be and the 
guards would clash and out of that,

903
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,730
and I know the death and destruction 
that went with it.

904
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:52,750
The two tribes would integrate and maybe
that would take hundreds of years and 

905
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,960
the religious system that sat above 
that,

906
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:56,810
which was the representation of the 
dominance hierarchy,

907
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,050
would also transform.
So you take [inaudible] Bay and you take

908
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:05,051
try b and then you'd take tried c and 
then you paid try b and they all 

909
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,190
accumulate across time and,
and,

910
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:12,290
and sort out and articulate and 
represent all of their beliefs.

911
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:17,470
And what happens is that this tribe has 
a game and this tribe has a game and 

912
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:23,021
this tribe has a game.
And then if you put all those games 

913
00:53:23,021 --> 00:53:24,320
together,
they tilt so that a metagame emerges out

914
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:25,240
of it.
It's,

915
00:53:25,241 --> 00:53:28,050
it's like if it's,
if it's fortunate,

916
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:32,120
the best of all three games gets put 
together in a larger game and it,

917
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,740
it has to be the best because otherwise 
it won't work.

918
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,780
The thing will fall apart,
right?

919
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,320
Because if,
if,

920
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:42,360
if your family unit isn't functional,
it'll disperse,

921
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,710
you know,
and,

922
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,140
and maybe people will die because of it.
It has to have the,

923
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:51,170
it has to be iterative,
it has to be playable across time 

924
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,660
without falling apart from internal 
pressure and without getting wiped notes

925
00:53:53,661 --> 00:53:56,010
from the outside.
So it's very tightly constrained.

926
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,120
So then let's say this happens over tens
of thousands of years,

927
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:00,650
we could say,
well,

928
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:05,660
it happened in the Middle East because 
we know that as Mesopotamia came 

929
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:05,660
together,
for example,

930
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:10,160
it was the aggregation of multiple 
tribes and all of the Gods of those 

931
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,271
tribes.
And we know the Mesopotamians organized 

932
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,410
all those gods into one God,
his name was Marduk.

933
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:20,630
And that the story that they tell about 
the aggregation of the gods into one is 

934
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:25,371
the story of the gods getting together 
and voting on which of them should be at

935
00:54:26,311 --> 00:54:26,880
the talk.

936
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:32,810
And then we know that the Mesopotamian 
emperor was charged with the 

937
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:37,581
responsibility of acting out that taught
gone and that that's what made him a 

938
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:43,221
good emperor,
and he got reminded of that every year 

939
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:46,161
at the new year ceremony,
he had to tell all the ways that he 

940
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:47,520
hadn't been a good Marduk and then he'd 
get punished for it,

941
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:52,790
and then they would reenact the battle 
of the gods and recreate this martech 

942
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:52,790
character.
Okay,

943
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:57,531
so,
so you can understand how that might've 

944
00:54:57,531 --> 00:54:59,810
come about.
Now you could say that the idea of that 

945
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:03,270
emergent ideal that was not,
that wasn't rational,

946
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,670
it was the consequence of conflict and 
cooperation in,

947
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:11,670
in the real world across time.
The representations of that were,

948
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:17,060
you know,
we might think about them as narrative 

949
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:17,060
representations or if they're deep 
enough,

950
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,450
even as an anthology,
you could think about those as the,

951
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,050
as the soil for which religious 
presuppositions emerge.

952
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:27,650
And so what happens is that what you 
have at the top of the dominance 

953
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:31,671
hierarchy as your representation of the 
good person is no different in its 

954
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:38,121
totality.
Then the idea of the sovereign God that 

955
00:55:38,121 --> 00:55:40,740
has emerged across thousands and 
thousands of years of human history,

956
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:46,010
so the whole structure has this thing at
the top and it's regarded in imagination

957
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:51,501
as divine.
It's the consequence of the represent 

958
00:55:51,501 --> 00:55:53,760
the consequence of the battle of 
representations,

959
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:59,310
of morality in imagination across 
thousands and thousands of years,

960
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,900
and that's a reflection of the actual 
conflict and restructuring of society is

961
00:56:03,901 --> 00:56:07,260
across all that time.
So then you have this thing at the top,

962
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:09,660
so we could say in the West,
in western Europe,

963
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:14,661
that thing at the top is Christ and 
that's the dying and the dying and dying

964
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:19,320
and revivifying hero.
We talked about reasons for that.

965
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:22,200
That's the thing that can go to the 
underworld and then come back up.

966
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,070
Okay,
that's at the top.

967
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,170
What happens when it disappears?
What will turn to Dostoevsky for that?

968
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:42,090
This is from notes from underground,
so this is someone who's in the 

969
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:43,840
underground and that's where you go when
your value systems collapsed.

970
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,630
I'm a sick man.
I'm a spiteful man.

971
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:51,760
I'm an unattractive man.
I believe my liver is diseased.

972
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:56,790
However,
I know nothing at all about my disease 

973
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:56,790
and do not know for certain what ails 
me.

974
00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:01,770
I don't consult a doctor for it and 
never have I ever respect her medicine 

975
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:06,781
than doctors.
Besides I'm extremely superstitious 

976
00:57:06,781 --> 00:57:07,630
sufficiently,
so to respect medicine.

977
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:12,720
Anyway,
I am well educated enough not to be 

978
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:12,720
superstitious,
but.

979
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,360
But I am superstitious.
No,

980
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:18,361
I refuse to consult a doctor from spike 
that you will probably not understand.

981
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,370
Well,
I understand that though.

982
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:27,420
Of course I can't explain who it is,
precisely that I'm more declining in 

983
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,450
this case.
By my spite.

984
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:34,110
I'm perfectly well aware that I cannot 
pay out the doctors and extract revenge 

985
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,320
by not consulting them.

986
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:39,220
I know better than anyone that by all 
this I'm only injuring myself and no one

987
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:40,450
else,
but still,

988
00:57:40,451 --> 00:57:43,150
if I don't consult a doctor,
it's from spiked.

989
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,550
My liver is bad.
Well,

990
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,180
let it get worse.
Now he's a civil servant.

991
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:56,080
I low ranting civil servant and he's 
retired because he got a little bit of 

992
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,490
inheritance.
He says,

993
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:02,620
when petitioners used to come for 
information to the table at which I sat,

994
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:08,220
I used to grind my teeth at them and I 
felt intense enjoyment when I succeeded 

995
00:58:08,271 --> 00:58:12,100
in making anybody unhappy,
I almost always succeeded.

996
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,040
For the most part.
They were all timid people.

997
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,370
Of course they were petitioners,
but you know,

998
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:20,950
gentlemen,
what was the chief point about my spite?

999
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:27,270
Well,
the whole point that the real standard 

1000
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,950
lay it in the fact that continually even
in the moment of the acute spleen,

1001
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:35,160
I was inwardly conscious with shame,
that I was not only not spiteful,

1002
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:40,171
but not even embittered and that I was 
simply scaring sparrows at random and 

1003
00:58:40,171 --> 00:58:41,230
amusing myself by it.

1004
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,630
I was lying when I just said,
now that I was a spiteful officials,

1005
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,960
I was lying from spike.
I was simply amusing myself with the 

1006
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,110
petitioners and with the officer and in 
reality,

1007
00:58:53,111 --> 00:58:58,111
I never could become spiteful.
I was conscious every moment in myself 

1008
00:58:58,111 --> 00:59:01,390
of many very many elements,
absolutely opposite to that.

1009
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:06,040
I felt them positively swarming in me 
these opposite elements.

1010
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:10,360
I knew that they had been swarming and 
me my whole life and craving some outlet

1011
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:12,640
for me,
but I would not let them out,

1012
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:17,590
would not let them purposely,
purposely would not let them out.

1013
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:23,540
He tormented me until I was ashamed.
They drove me to convulsions and sick 

1014
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,100
and be at last.
At last.

1015
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:30,101
How are they sick and me now.
You're not fencing gentleman that I'm 

1016
00:59:30,101 --> 00:59:33,530
expressing remorse for something.
Now that I'm asking your forgiveness for

1017
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:38,531
something,
I'm sure you're fancying that however I 

1018
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:42,311
assure you I do not care if you are.
It was not only that I could not become 

1019
00:59:42,311 --> 00:59:46,130
a spiteful.
I did not know how to become anything,

1020
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,900
neither spiteful nor kind.
Neither a rascal nor and honest man.

1021
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:56,770
Neither hero nor an insect.
Now I'm living my life out in my corner,

1022
00:59:57,871 --> 01:00:02,871
taunting myself with the spike lists and
useless constellation that an 

1023
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:05,460
intelligent man cannot become anything 
seriously,

1024
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,980
and it's only the fool who becomes 
anything.

1025
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:17,220
A direct person I regard as the real 
normal man

1026
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:25,420
as his tender mother.
Nature wished to see him once she 

1027
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:25,640
graciously brought them into being on 
the earth.

1028
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,240
I not such a man til I'm green in the 
face,

1029
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,510
he's stupid.
I'm not disputing that,

1030
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,760
but perhaps the normal man should be 
stupid.

1031
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:38,420
How do you know?
Perhaps it's very beautiful in fact,

1032
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:44,620
and I am the more persuaded of that 
suspicion if one can call it so by the 

1033
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:48,881
fact that you take,
for instance the antithesis of the 

1034
01:00:48,881 --> 01:00:51,260
normal man that is the man of acute 
selfconsciousness who has come,

1035
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:54,080
of course not out of the lap of nature,
but out of a retort.

1036
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,920
This is also almost mysticism gentlemen,
but I suspect this to miss retort made,

1037
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:03,930
man is sometimes so nonplussed in the 
presence of his intense USCIS,

1038
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:08,120
the normal man that with all his 
exaggerated self consciousness,

1039
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:11,570
he genuinely thinks himself a mouse and 
automation at all.

1040
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,980
It may be an acutely conscious mouse,
yet it is a mouse.

1041
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:19,880
Well,
the other is a man and therefore etc.

1042
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,610
Etc.
And thE worst of it is he himself,

1043
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:25,970
his very own self looks on himself as a 
mouse.

1044
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:30,110
No one asks him to do so.
And that's an important point.

1045
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:32,690
Now,
let us look at this mouse in action.

1046
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,890
Let us suppose for existence,
for instance,

1047
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:42,220
that it feels insulted and it almost 
always feels insulted and it wants to 

1048
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:47,681
revenge itself too.
There mAy even be a greater of a 

1049
01:01:47,681 --> 01:01:50,480
cumulation of spike in it than in the 
man of nature and truth,

1050
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,490
the base and nasty desire to vent that 
spite on it's a sale.

1051
01:01:54,491 --> 01:01:59,491
Assailant rankles,
perhaps even more nastily in it than in 

1052
01:01:59,491 --> 01:02:02,540
the man of nature and truth for throw 
these innate stupidity,

1053
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,750
the latter.
The normal mac looks upon his revenge.

1054
01:02:05,751 --> 01:02:09,400
Is justice pure and simple?
Well in consequences,

1055
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:13,580
his acute selfconsciousness the mouse 
does not believe in any justice at all.

1056
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:19,360
To come at last to the deed itself to 
the very act of revenge apart from one

1057
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:25,010
the one fundamental nastiness.
The luck was mouse succeeds in creating 

1058
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:28,371
around it.
So many other nastiness is in the form 

1059
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:29,340
of doubts and questions adds to the one 
question.

1060
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:33,510
So many unsettled questions that there 
are inevitably works around it,

1061
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,970
up around it,
a sort of fatal brute,

1062
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,600
a stinking mess made up of it's doubts.
Emotions,

1063
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,520
end of the content spat upon it by the 
direct men of action who stands solemnly

1064
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:48,600
about it as judges and arbitrators 
laughing at it until they're healthy,

1065
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:51,030
sides ache.
Of course,

1066
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:56,930
the only thing left for is to dismiss 
all that with a wave of it's paul and 

1067
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:01,521
with a smile of assumed contempt in 
which it does not even itself believe 

1068
01:03:01,521 --> 01:03:05,700
and creep ignominiously into its 
mousehole there and it's nasty.

1069
01:03:05,701 --> 01:03:08,940
Stinking underground.
Home are insulted,

1070
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:13,920
crushed and ridiculed.
Mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold,

1071
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:19,160
malignant and above all everlasting 
spite for 40 years together,

1072
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:25,800
it will remember it's injury down to the
smallest most ignominious details,

1073
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,060
and every time we'll add up itself 
detail still more in ignominious,

1074
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:33,270
spitefully,
teasing and turmeric itself with its own

1075
01:03:33,271 --> 01:03:37,890
imagination.
It will be ashamed of it's imaginings,

1076
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:40,920
yet it will recall it all.
It will go over and over every detail.

1077
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:43,470
It will invent unheard of things against
itself,

1078
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,550
pretending that those things might have 
happened and will forgive nothing.

1079
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,050
Maybe it will begin to revenge itself 
too,

1080
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:57,380
but as it were piece meal in trivial 
ways from behind the stove incognito,

1081
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,800
without believing either in its own 
right to vengeance or in the success of 

1082
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:07,671
its revenge.
knowing that from all its efforts at 

1083
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:08,280
revenge,
it will suffer a hundred times more than

1084
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:12,000
he on whom it revenge itself.
While he I dare say,

1085
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:16,310
well not even scratch itself on its 
deathbed,

1086
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,320
it will recall it all over again.
With interest accumulated over all the 

1087
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:26,181
years now.
The idea that nietzsche dostoevsky were 

1088
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:43,950
developing was that

1089
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:51,350
the dawning of consciousness in western 
society of the mythological substructure

1090
01:04:55,770 --> 01:05:00,770
of the value system and the 
impossibility of conceptualizing that or

1091
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:08,810
proving the validity of it's structured 
from scientific means doomed it to do 

1092
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:16,890
the people who were encapsulated in that
system to formal disbelief in it and 

1093
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:21,390
what they concluded from that was 
exactly what dos dsd,

1094
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,760
just stripe,
which is that someone with that level of

1095
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:29,761
acute consciousness and cultural self 
knowledge would immediately come become 

1096
01:05:30,101 --> 01:05:33,340
fragmented beyond belief,
unable to act,

1097
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,550
unhappy,
resentful and dangerous,

1098
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:42,400
and both osteous in nature and in their 
works and dostoevsky developed this idea

1099
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:45,280
most particularly in a novel called the 
devil's said,

1100
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:47,740
that once that you had got to that 
point,

1101
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,920
which was inevitable if you were smart 
enough to take seriously what was going 

1102
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,761
on.
It was oNly a tiny step to 

1103
01:05:56,761 --> 01:05:56,761
identification with a murderer city 
ology.

1104
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:05,680
Now,
some of the existentialists started to 

1105
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,790
work up what you might regard as a 
solution to this problem,

1106
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,640
and I'm going to read character guards

1107
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:20,430
solution.

1108
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:33,960
It is now cure.
ChAracter guard was a danish existential

1109
01:06:33,961 --> 01:06:38,820
philosopher and he lived earlier the 
niche and he was,

1110
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:43,850
in some sense,
you might think about him as the first 

1111
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:47,480
modern psychologist he was.
He was the first person to 

1112
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:47,480
conceptualize,
for example,

1113
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,430
of the separate entity of anxiety and 
despair.

1114
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:56,690
It is now about four years ago that I 
got the notion of wanting to try my luck

1115
01:06:56,691 --> 01:07:01,691
as an author.
I remember it quite clearly.

1116
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:05,550
That was on a sunday.
Yes,

1117
01:07:05,551 --> 01:07:06,840
that's it.
It's sunday afternoon.

1118
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:11,730
I was seated as usual out of doors at 
the cafe in the fredericksburg garden.

1119
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,260
I'd been a student for half a score of 
years,

1120
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:21,440
although never lazy.
All my activity nevertheless was like a 

1121
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,171
glittering inactivity.
I kind of occupation for which I still 

1122
01:07:24,171 --> 01:07:26,490
have a great partiality and for which I 
perhaps even have a little genius.

1123
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:32,330
I read much spent the remainder of the 
day idling and thinking our or thinking 

1124
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:34,140
and idling,
but that was all it came to,

1125
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:39,290
so I sat there and smoke my cigar until 
I lapsed into thought among other 

1126
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:43,830
thoughts.
I remember these you are goiNg on.

1127
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:48,831
I said to myself to become an old man 
without being anything and without 

1128
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,700
really undertaking to do anything on the
other hand,

1129
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:54,630
wherever you look around you in life and
in literature,

1130
01:07:54,631 --> 01:07:56,610
you see the celebrated names and 
figures,

1131
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,880
the precious and much heralded men who 
were coming into prominence and who are 

1132
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:05,601
much talked about the many benefactors 
of the age who know how to benefit 

1133
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:07,680
mankind by making life easier and 
easier,

1134
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:11,250
some by railways,
others by omnibuses and steamboats,

1135
01:08:11,251 --> 01:08:16,251
others by telegraph,
others by easily apprehended 

1136
01:08:16,251 --> 01:08:19,551
compendiums,
short and recitals of everything worth 

1137
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:21,971
knowing,
and finally the true benefactors of the 

1138
01:08:21,971 --> 01:08:24,110
age who make spiritual existence easier 
and easier,

1139
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:28,100
yet more and more significant,
and what are you doing here?

1140
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:33,100
My soliloquy,
it was interrupted for my cigar with 

1141
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,261
smoked out and a new one had to be lit 
so I smoked again and then suddenly this

1142
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:38,570
thought flashed through my mind.
You must do something,

1143
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,690
but in as much with your Limited 
capacities,

1144
01:08:41,691 --> 01:08:44,870
it will be impossible to make anything 
easier than it has become.

1145
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:50,350
You must with the same humanitarian 
enthusiasm as the others undertake to 

1146
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:55,691
make something harder.
This notion pleased me immensely and at 

1147
01:08:55,691 --> 01:09:00,461
the same time it flattered me to think 
that I like the rest of them would be 

1148
01:09:00,461 --> 01:09:01,370
loved and esteemed by the whole 
community,

1149
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,200
for when all combined in every way to 
make everything easier,

1150
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:12,340
there remains only one possible danger,
namely that the eas becomes so great 

1151
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:16,610
that it becomes altogether too great.
Then there is only one want left,

1152
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:21,670
though it is not yet felt want,
when people will want difficulty out of 

1153
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:24,830
love for mankind and out of disparate my
embarrassing situation,

1154
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:30,040
seeing that I had accomplished nothing 
and was unable to make anything easier 

1155
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,911
than it already was,
and moved by a genuine interest in those

1156
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:39,521
who make everything easy.
I can see that as my task to create 

1157
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,540
difficulties everywhere.

1158
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:54,500
Same idea in different words,
a traveler.

1159
01:09:54,501 --> 01:09:59,501
This is nature and this is part of the 
development of his answer to the 

1160
01:09:59,501 --> 01:10:02,891
conundrum that he rates a traveler would
seen many countries and peoples and 

1161
01:10:02,891 --> 01:10:07,861
several continents was asked what human 
traits he had found everywhere and he 

1162
01:10:07,861 --> 01:10:08,630
answered.
Men are inclined to laziness.

1163
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:11,510
Some will feel that he might've said 
with greater justice,

1164
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:16,720
they are all timid.
They hide behind customs and opinions at

1165
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:18,350
bottom.
However,

1166
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:23,830
every human being knows very well that 
he is in this world just once as 

1167
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:27,581
something unique and no accident,
however strange we'll throw together a 

1168
01:10:28,281 --> 01:10:32,930
second time into a unity such a curious 
and diffuse plurality.

1169
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:36,950
He knows it,
but he hides it like a bad conscience.

1170
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:43,450
Why procurer of his neighbor who insists
on convention and veils himself with it,

1171
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:51,250
but what is it that compels the 
individual human being to fear his 

1172
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,981
neighbor and to think and act heard 
fashion and not to be glad of himself a 

1173
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:57,680
sense of shame perhaps in a few rare 
cases in the vast majority,

1174
01:10:57,681 --> 01:10:59,830
it's the desire for comfort and inertia.

1175
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:05,470
In short,
that inclination to laziness of which 

1176
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:05,990
the traveler spoke,
he's right.

1177
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,480
Men are even lazier than they are 
timorous,

1178
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:12,800
and what they fear most is the troubles 
with which any unconditional honesty and

1179
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:17,810
nudity would burden them.
Only artists hate this slovenly life in 

1180
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:21,540
borrowed manners and loosely fitting 
opinions and unveiled the secret.

1181
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:27,290
Everybody's bad conscience.
The principle that every human being is 

1182
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:29,250
a unique wonder.
They dared to show us the human being as

1183
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:32,550
he is down to the last muscle himself 
and himself alone.

1184
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:37,740
Even more that in this rigorous 
consistency of his uniqueness,

1185
01:11:37,741 --> 01:11:42,741
he is beautiful and worth contemplating 
as novel and as incredible as any work 

1186
01:11:42,741 --> 01:11:44,550
of nature,
and by no means dope.

1187
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:51,370
When a great thinker despises man,
it's their laziness that he despises for

1188
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:54,020
it is on account of this,
that they have the appearance of factory

1189
01:11:54,021 --> 01:11:59,021
products and seem indifferent and 
unworthy of companionship or 

1190
01:11:59,021 --> 01:12:02,861
instruction.
The human being who does not wish to 

1191
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:07,631
belong to the mass materially seats must
merely cease being comfortable with 

1192
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:11,870
himself.
Let him follow his conscience,

1193
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:14,660
which shouts at him.
Be yourself.

1194
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:17,630
What you are at present,
doing,

1195
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:20,510
opining,
and desiring.

1196
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:24,660
That's not really you.

1197
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:40,850
That's nietzsche and dostoevsky and 
existentialism in.

1198
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,920
That's the bare beginning of the thing.
