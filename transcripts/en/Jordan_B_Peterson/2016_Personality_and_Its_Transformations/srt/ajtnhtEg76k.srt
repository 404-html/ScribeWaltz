1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I talked a little bit last time about 
what we were going to cover,

2
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,430
but I didn't get quite through it,
so I'm going to finish that.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,650
For those of you who weren't here last 
time,

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,450
you can watch the lecture because it's 
online.

5
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:13,530
So,
um,

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,700
we,
we stopped at the depth psychologist.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,710
Really those are the psychoanalysts.
Psychoanalysts are people who are 

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,590
concerned with,

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,560
well,
for a psychoanalyst,

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:31,590
roughly speaking,
you're a collection of loosely 

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,291
integrated spirits.
That's one way of thinking about it or 

12
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:37,471
subpersonalities you're not a unity and 
no subpersonalities have their basis in 

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,620
while and all sorts of things.
They might have their basis in past,

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,680
especially traumatic experience or in 
patterns of socialization that 

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,690
characterized your family,
but they might also have their basis in 

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,800
fundamental biological motivational 
systems.

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,050
So for example,
a psychoanalyst would conceptualize it,

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,170
anger or,
or perhaps sexual attraction as a 

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,310
subpersonality.
And the reason for that is that,

20
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,670
well,
you know what it's like when you get 

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:08,670
angry,
you get angry at someone you love.

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,700
And you know,
first of all,

23
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:13,210
you know at some level you're wishing 
harm.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,210
Now that might only be that you want to 
win the argument and you want them to be

25
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:18,340
nicely crushed while you do it,
but so,

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,920
so there's a desire that comes along 
with the anger,

27
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:25,921
but,
but there's a lot of other things that 

28
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:25,921
happened to.

29
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:25,921
So for example,
if someone's annoying you,

30
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:30,571
even if you love them,
the probability that at that moment 

31
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:33,631
you're going to be able to easily access
all the memories you have about how 

32
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:37,681
annoying they are and have difficult 
time accessing the memories about how 

33
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,860
wonderful they mean to you is quite 
high.

34
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:44,010
You know,
and you know that because sometimes you 

35
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,051
get angry with someone,
you have an argument with them and you 

36
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:48,180
sort of clue in later you snap out of 
you're more or less possessed state and 

37
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,480
you think,
yeah,

38
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,150
well,
you know,

39
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,810
I really wasn't taking the context into 
mind and I was kind of harsh.

40
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,340
So.
Well,

41
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:55,780
so and so.
Then you think,

42
00:01:55,781 --> 00:02:00,781
well who's in control?
And that's the question the 

43
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:03,871
psychoanalysts are really interested in.
And their answer is it's not generally 

44
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:08,041
you.
And so it's very terrifying reading in 

45
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,101
some sense because you know,
people like to think of themselves as 

46
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,010
masters of their own house so to speak,
and it's just,

47
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,390
it's only vaguely true.
And you know,

48
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:18,460
people,
you know that too because you make

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,010
maybe New Year's Eve,
what do you call those resolutions,

50
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:29,011
how you're going to be a better person.
I think one of the most common ones is 

51
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:29,011
mad and you're going to hit the gym 
three times a week.

52
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:29,410
It's like,
no,

53
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:32,650
you're not actually.
And so very few people do.

54
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:37,651
And that's partly because,
well it's hard and so you don't want to 

55
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:40,711
do hard things.
And the reason for that is because 

56
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:40,711
they're hard.
So it doesn't take much explanation,

57
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,720
but it's also because you can't just 
tell yourself what to do.

58
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,660
And that's annoying too because life 
would be a lot easier if you could just 

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:49,660
say,
okay,

60
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,560
well you don't sit down study for two 
hours,

61
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:53,800
don't watch cats on youtube or whatever 
it is that you're watching.

62
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,730
And No,
no,

63
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:55,900
no,
that isn't what happens.

64
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:57,790
You sit there and you study for a while 
and then you know,

65
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:02,791
you're thinking about cats and next 
thing you know you're watching haunted 

66
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,990
mansions in London or some damn thing,
you know,

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,830
so,
so,

68
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,180
and it's a scary idea in some sense 
because if you think,

69
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:12,130
well,
if you're not reading master of your own

70
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:12,820
house,
you know,

71
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:17,821
if you don't have yourself under full 
voluntary control and you certainly 

72
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:17,980
don't,
then what does.

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,640
And you know,
Freud is interesting in that regard 

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,930
because he really talked about the 
motive power of fundamental motivational

75
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:30,931
systems.
Mostly for Freud it was aggression in 

76
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:30,931
sexuality,
you know,

77
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:30,931
and those are,
those are big motivators.

78
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:34,810
Let's make no mistake about it.
And so he thought of you as,

79
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,310
as the conscious part of your 
personality may be as the.

80
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,000
It's like the captain of a ship with a 
very unruly crew.

81
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,450
It's a nice metaphor because of course 
the ships on the ocean and the ocean can

82
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:51,451
be very stormy.
And so you can only sort of plot your 

83
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:52,300
course and you have to work with what's 
thrown at you.

84
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:54,850
And then the unruly crew is,
well,

85
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:59,851
it's all your drives.
That drives is a wrong way of thinking 

86
00:03:59,851 --> 00:04:03,061
about it.
That I liked the psychoanalytic notion 

87
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:05,320
of subpersonality because the 
subpersonality has a viewpoint.

88
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:07,360
There's things it wants and it plants.

89
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,400
So it's,
it's,

90
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:08,870
uh,
it's,

91
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:10,420
it's an,
it's a living entity.

92
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,480
It's not some dead cognitive system.
No.

93
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,390
So Freud was interested in some sense 
more about,

94
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,480
I would say,
the biological underpinnings of the 

95
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,480
subpersonalities,
you know,

96
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,480
because he was,
he was,

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,430
he was quite biologically oriented in 
and he realized that sexuality and 

98
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,240
aggression,
we're very fundamental subpersonalities.

99
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,870
And then there's young and young is much
more terrifying than Freud,

100
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,630
which is really saying a lot because 
Freud's quite terrifying,

101
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,040
but you,
he,

102
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,700
he's just terrifying the unbelief.
And you know,

103
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,980
for you,
the sub personalities that make you up 

104
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,280
are thousands and thousands of years 
old.

105
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,910
They're cultural constructions that are 
thousands and thousands of years old and

106
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:51,930
they have you in their grip.
So for union,

107
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,500
for example,
one of the things he said,

108
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,050
and I don't remember where it was,
I love this phrase,

109
00:04:56,051 --> 00:05:01,051
it's so true.
And you can think about this for like 

110
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,870
five years and,
and you can still think about it after 

111
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:03,870
that.

112
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,650
One of the things you said was that 
people don't have ideas,

113
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,740
ideas have people.
And that's really something to think 

114
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,790
about because you know,
just think about your own situation,

115
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,720
so no doubt you have political views and
you think I have political views.

116
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,420
It's like,
well no you don't because you share them

117
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:22,810
with a lot of other people,
so they're certainly not yours.

118
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,200
And not only that,
they've had a very lengthy historical 

119
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,370
development far before you ever showed 
up,

120
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,740
you know,
so they're rooted rooted,

121
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,980
right at the depths of your culture.
But then of course they've been 

122
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,041
elaborated by one philosopher or another
extensively over the last two or 300 

123
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,180
years.
And there's this whole system of thought

124
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:48,181
and Poof,
it inhabits your brain and then you 

125
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,181
think,
well,

126
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,181
I've got political views.
It's like,

127
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,150
no,
the political views have you.

128
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,050
And that's a very salutary thought 
because it's one of the ways to stop 

129
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:03,071
yourself from being possessed because 
people get possessed all the time by 

130
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:03,071
ideas.

131
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,730
Right?
That's what happened in Nazi Germany.

132
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,590
That's what happened in the Soviet 
Union.

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,280
It happens everywhere all the time and 
you might think,

134
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:12,080
well possessed is a little strong,
but.

135
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,090
But no,
it's not actually.

136
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:17,000
It's a very nice.
It's a metaphor obviously,

137
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,180
but it's the right kind of metaphor 
because a body of ideas like political 

138
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,600
ideas,
there are living thing,

139
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,660
you know they're not.
They're not some dead dusty words on a 

140
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,531
bookshelf somewhere.
They're an integral part of a dynamic 

141
00:06:32,531 --> 00:06:35,270
society and and the motive force,
those ideas have motivates you.

142
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:40,271
You're in their grip and so you can tell
when you're talking to someone who's 

143
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:44,860
completely possessed by it,
by an idea system or in India logical 

144
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,101
system because they'll just bore you to 
death unless you happen to believe 

145
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:51,971
exactly the same thing.
So they'll spout out a few of their 

146
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:54,701
fundamental belief axioms and then you 
can identify which system they're part 

147
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:59,141
of and then they just speak in cliches 
from that point onward and you can 

148
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:02,060
predict everything you're going to say 
if you know the axioms of the system.

149
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,510
So it's very.
It's very non authentic speech and that 

150
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:11,110
would be a way that say someone like 
Rogers or or,

151
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,120
or Abraham maslow who were humanists of 
the 19 sixties might talk about it 

152
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,931
because the person isn't speaking from 
the depths of their own experience or 

153
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:20,980
from even their embodied knowledge,
you know,

154
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,990
they're just mouthpieces for abstract 
ideas and so it's very frightening to 

155
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:31,010
realize the extent to which you can be 
the mouthpiece for abstract ideas,

156
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,040
you know,
and it's actually one of the dangers of 

157
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,141
becoming educated,
especially in the mass system like the 

158
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,601
university system because a lot of what 
happens to you when you come to 

159
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:43,541
university is that you're fed a set of 
pre digested ideas.

160
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:46,880
I suppose that's one way of thinking 
about it.

161
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,950
You know,
and it's very easy for you to think,

162
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,230
well that those are now your ideas.

163
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,260
They're not.
There are not lots of ideas you have to 

164
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,600
earn and if it's a great idea,
then you really have to earn it.

165
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,200
Because why should you be able to come 
along and like pluck up a great idea.

166
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,190
That's not how things work.
You have to earn things that are 

167
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,190
valuable.
So anyways,

168
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,790
the depth psychologist man,
they're so good at that.

169
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,970
It's lovely to read them.
And the problem too is with a lot of the

170
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:18,971
people we're going to talk about,
it's very difficult to summarize their 

171
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:18,971
work,
you know,

172
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:20,600
because often the devil's in the 
details.

173
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,090
So you know,
you might look at someone like piaget is

174
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:28,091
a good example,
the constructivist that we talked about 

175
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:28,091
briefly,
man,

176
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,510
the guy wrote dozens of books.
You can't just summarize those suckers.

177
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:34,511
It's not one coherent theory that you 
can boil down to 10 axioms and then you 

178
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:38,330
can read it while you're flying from 
Toronto to Montreal and Poof,

179
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:38,940
Europe yet.

180
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,330
And psychologists like it doesn't work 
like that.

181
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,360
The people who make who formulated these
theories were extremely intelligent and,

182
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,580
and,
and they're often great writers and so a

183
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:54,581
lot of the knowledge is actually in the 
writing itself and nodding what you can 

184
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:55,010
extract out from the just,
you know,

185
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,600
and most of the theorists,
Freud Young,

186
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,740
it's harder,
but freud,

187
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,600
rogers,
people like that.

188
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,960
You can extract out the gist of their 
theories and then you can,

189
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,150
uh,
what would you say?

190
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,420
You can,
you can stereotype it or you can correct

191
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,430
your it and then you can point out how 
your caricatures observed and then you 

192
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,620
can feel like you're even smarter than 
Freud,

193
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,700
you know,
you're not.

194
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,940
So it's not a good idea.
And so these people should also be 

195
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,420
approached with respect because man,
they have so much to tell you.

196
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:26,520
It's so useful.
Okay.

197
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,060
So we talked about the depth 
psychologist.

198
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,640
We talked about the constructivists.
We didn't talk about the humanists,

199
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,630
the existentialists or phenomenologists 
a mouthful of words,

200
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:41,631
you know.
So let's put a little bit of foundation 

201
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,480
under those.
So if you're a humanist,

202
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,160
to be a humanist means really to be a 
creature of the enlightenment.

203
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,670
And a human is thought in some sense,
at least this is what the humanists 

204
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,640
thing.
They think of it as post religious,

205
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,900
you know,
and they,

206
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,920
they think of a humanistic thought as 
putting the value of the human being at 

207
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:05,250
the center of the cosmos in some sense,
valuing the person as they are.

208
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:08,820
And then also valuing the person that 
they could be and,

209
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,840
and promoting the pathways of 
development that would allow people to 

210
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:19,440
become what they could be as creatures 
that are valuable in their own right.

211
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,240
So a humanist,
for example,

212
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,170
would be very skeptical of claims.

213
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,200
So let's say standard Christian claims,
and I use that example because the realm

214
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,600
of ideas that these thinkers emerged out
of was almost always Judeo Christian and

215
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:37,800
so you know,
their,

216
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,930
the roots of their thinking are in those
systems and you can't understand their 

217
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,491
thinking without understanding that.
And so part of humanism was a rebellion 

218
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:48,570
against the idea that life on earth,
so to speak,

219
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:51,870
was of limited value because everything 
of any importance was going to happen in

220
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:55,350
the afterlife after you die.
So it's like,

221
00:10:55,351 --> 00:11:00,351
no,
it's here and now it's right now that 

222
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:00,351
matters.
And you know,

223
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:03,621
life in the present is what's important 
and you don't need some kind of 

224
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:07,041
afterlife or some kind of belief in a 
transcendent reality in order to find 

225
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,250
value right here and now.
So,

226
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,310
you know,
fine,

227
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,100
there's a lot of good things about that 
idea.

228
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:17,070
And the whole idea that you can improve 
yourself in some sense is a humanistic 

229
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,011
idea and most of you have been,
how many of you believe that you can 

230
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:22,011
improve yourself?

231
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,510
So is there anybody who doesn't believe 
that it's,

232
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,710
that's willing to admit it.
So usually people only don't believe 

233
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,920
that if they're very depressed or 
hopeless,

234
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,690
but it's not self evident,
you know,

235
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,640
I mean,
and in,

236
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:37,230
in many cultures you could think of 
medieval culture,

237
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:38,700
for example,
in Europe where you know,

238
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:43,701
you were sort of stuck in your position.
There is no real idea of self 

239
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:45,270
improvement.
You could try not to sin,

240
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,330
but you aren't going to get like 
radically better in some way.

241
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:50,820
You are just who you were.
And that was that.

242
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,800
But not,
that's not the case for the,

243
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,940
the existentialists were kind of a 
different kettle of fish.

244
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,840
So you know,
when Freud talks about psychopathology,

245
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:04,510
because a lot of personality is about 
pathology,

246
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:06,280
right?
How personal this can go wrong.

247
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,670
Freud kind of thinks of the normal 
person roughly speaking as healthy in 

248
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,171
their normality,
but perhaps transformed into a 

249
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:19,561
pathological version of themselves by 
some sort of past trauma and that might 

250
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:20,870
often be an abusive childhood,
you know,

251
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,890
or or maybe a sexually abusive childhood
because you know Freud talked a lot 

252
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:25,890
about that.

253
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,930
It happens fairly frequently,
so for Freud,

254
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,740
all things considered.
If you weren't healthy,

255
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,610
there was a reason for it.
You know,

256
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,630
something terrible that happened to you 
and you needed to come to terms with 

257
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,721
that terrible thing.
However you might do that and put 

258
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:42,970
yourself back together and then you 
could wander along.

259
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,460
Being a healthy person,
but the existentialists,

260
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:50,461
that's not how they think at all.
They think the standard human being is 

261
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:54,631
pathological and the reason they think 
that is because they think that self 

262
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:56,530
conscious existence,
so life,

263
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,030
the life of a creature that knows it's 
bounded in time and space,

264
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:06,031
right?
Knows it's vulnerable to disease and 

265
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:10,081
illness and death and the loss of things
that they love and the disintegration of

266
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:15,361
all things in some sense is that's 
enough of a problem to give you 

267
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,590
problems.
Without having to have been abused by 

268
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,471
it,
and so the existentialists view life 

269
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:25,621
itself as a problem of sufficient 
magnitude that it can destabilize you 

270
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,330
mentally merely by being aware of it.

271
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,140
And so they also believe that often what
people do as a consequence of that is 

272
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,290
flee from their own awareness,
you know,

273
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:40,291
so how do you deal with the fact that 
life is suffering but you don't think 

274
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:40,291
about it?
Well,

275
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,880
for an existentialist that's not a very 
good answer.

276
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:46,240
And I would also say generally speaking,
for clinical psychologists,

277
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:51,241
that's also not a very good answer 
because the literature suggests pretty 

278
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:54,880
damn strongly that the harder you run 
from something you're afraid of,

279
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:58,090
the larger it becomes and the faster it 
chases you.

280
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,750
So avoidance of avoidance is generally a
very bad strategy.

281
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,260
Now it's not always the case because 
sometimes if you can't do anything about

282
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:13,261
something really you can't.
Well there's not a lot of sense spending

283
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:15,730
a lot of time planning and struggling 
against it.

284
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:20,731
You know,
sometimes people are in generally 

285
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:20,731
genuinely hopeless situations,
but,

286
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:20,731
but often did not.

287
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,110
So I really liked the existentialist 
man.

288
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:24,280
I think they're.
Well,

289
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,020
I have all the people that we're going 
to talk about,

290
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,400
their thinking is extraordinarily 
valuable.

291
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,240
It helps situate you in your own life.
It helps clarify the nature of your 

292
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,880
relationship to other people in the 
world.

293
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:41,881
It helps you lay out what your future 
could be if you were the creatures that 

294
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,340
you could be really wonderful 
phenomenologists.

295
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:50,650
They're tricky bunch.
I'm the fundamental phenomenologists was

296
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Martin Heidegger,
who was also somewhat also somewhat 

297
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,340
tangled up with the Nazis.
Um,

298
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,230
you know,
which was clearly not a good thing.

299
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:06,231
And you know,
people debate about whether or not you 

300
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:08,591
can separate out his philosophy from 
what tangled them up with the Nazis and 

301
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:09,950
I think you can,
you know.

302
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,800
So anyways,
heidegger,

303
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,300
heidegger learned to take a fresh look 
at the nature of reality.

304
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:22,130
And so heidegger,
his idea was that we,

305
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,580
we made a fundamental philosophical era 
way back when,

306
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,950
when we were Greek,
ancient Greek,

307
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,010
roughly speaking,
and that we started concentrating on the

308
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:31,940
wrong elements of.

309
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,090
He didn't read.
He doesn't really call it reality being.

310
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,550
So a phenomenologist as someone who's 
concerned with being and you,

311
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,280
you might think,
well,

312
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:42,470
what's the difference between being in 
reality?

313
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:47,471
And the answer to that is it.
It depends on how you define being and 

314
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:51,371
it depends on how you define reality.
So heidegger's observation was that for,

315
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,980
for for modern people,
roughly speaking,

316
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,060
reality is sort of a d animated 
material,

317
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,410
objective substrata.
It's,

318
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,280
it's dead in its essence,
roughly speaking,

319
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:09,281
and the things that are most real are 
precisely those things you can think 

320
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:10,640
about that it's all objective reality 
for all intents and purposes,

321
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,940
but when what heidegger tried to point 
out is there's a choice in some sense 

322
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:22,030
because of your knowledge is finite 
because you're fundamentally ignorant 

323
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,051
about all things.
You have to decide that certain things 

324
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:26,960
are true and then act from that point 
and you know,

325
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:31,961
heidegger's point was there's a lot of 
things that you can decide about at the 

326
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:35,621
very fundamental level of,
of axiom and so one of the things you 

327
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,690
can decide for example,
is whether or not the objective world is

328
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:43,691
what's more real or whether or not your 
lived experience is what's more real now

329
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:46,760
you might think,
well what's the distinction there?

330
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,760
And I would say the distinction is 
probably something like watching someone

331
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,400
in pain on a video and being in pain 
yourself.

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,100
You know,
so pain is a good example of,

333
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,400
of an element of being.
Because it's obviously it's obviously 

334
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,810
you experience it within your own.

335
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,870
It's hard to talk about this because he 
uses different terminology.

336
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,760
Pain is an element of your being and 
it's,

337
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:21,830
it's not something,
it's the pain itself is not something 

338
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,430
that you can even conceptualize in 
objective terms.

339
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,630
Like you can measure it,
you know,

340
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:26,180
maybe your heart rate goes up when 
you're in pain or something like that or

341
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,850
your facial expressions change,
you know,

342
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:33,851
so you can index it.
But the indexes are not the phenomena 

343
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:35,930
that's hence phenomenology,
right?

344
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:39,680
And so the phenomenologists have built 
up an entire system of thinking,

345
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,160
predicated on the initial axiom that the
best way to approach life is to assume 

346
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,740
that being is the fundamental reality 
rather than the objective as the 

347
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,260
fundamental level.
And then you might think,

348
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:54,150
well why do people are with that sort of
thing?

349
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:57,900
And part of it is one of the.
This is an existentialist plate.

350
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:03,050
One of the consequences of developing 
the objective theory of existence was 

351
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:06,410
obviously all of the amazing technology 
we have around us and you know,

352
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,450
great thank going for that.
Otherwise we'd be sitting outside 

353
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,301
freezing.
But one of the consequences of that is 

354
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,631
once people established objective 
reality and then defined it as 

355
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:20,930
ultimately real terrible questions of 
the meaning of life or ropes,

356
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,020
you know,
like if the world,

357
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,540
the universe is made out of nothing but 
dead matter,

358
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:29,541
it's eternally existing.
We're nothing but a candle flashing the 

359
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,591
wind.
The idea creeps into your mind that 

360
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:33,690
perhaps all of the damn suffering isn't 
worth it or,

361
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,730
or could put it another way.
You know,

362
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:40,731
does your life really have any,
any real meaning or is that just an 

363
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:41,280
illusion?
Well,

364
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,580
heidegger would say the reason that you 
have that problem is because you're 

365
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,460
approaching the entire problem wrong.

366
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,100
Clearly things have meaning.
They just don't.

367
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:55,101
If you make the hypothesis,
that's what's our objective is 

368
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:58,500
ultimately real and everything else is 
merely a secondary consequence of that.

369
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,110
So anyways,
it's complicated.

370
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,060
It takes a while to get your head around
it.

371
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,330
I'm the humanists and the 
existentialists and to some degree the 

372
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,810
phenomenologists,
they all came out of,

373
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,170
there was,
there was a variety of sources for their

374
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:18,171
thoughts and I would say one of them is 
the clash between religion and science 

375
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:19,650
or between,
between value and objective truth.

376
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,650
They're trying to,
to rectify the division.

377
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:25,110
And Piaget himself was trying to do some
of that as well.

378
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,100
So it was young I guess.
Um,

379
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,420
and the other thing is a lot of the 
existentialist and humanist work was 

380
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,030
post World War Two.
And so,

381
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:38,630
you know,
after World War Two happened with its 

382
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,120
immense catastrophes,
of course people who were thinking about

383
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:44,121
human nature,
we're very interested in why such a 

384
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:46,281
thing could happen and existentialism at
least as a psychological school arose in

385
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,780
part as a reaction to the horrors of 
World War Two.

386
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,020
It's a very serious,
it's very serious branch of psychology 

387
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,830
and it was mostly characterized thinking
in the 19 fifties before the hippies 

388
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,460
came along and made everything sweetness
and light.

389
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,640
So which is more where Roger's and a 
maslow fit.

390
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,070
So we're going to talk about them a fair
bit that the three different categories.

391
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:12,210
So it's kind of a strange approach in 
some sense that this class takes.

392
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,110
Because I talked to you about some 
psychologists in that in that period,

393
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:19,110
but the other people I talked to you 
mostly about aren't set.

394
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,240
They're not technically psychologists.
Depends on what you mean by 

395
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,660
psychologist.
After all,

396
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,410
I talk a lot about Nietzsche and 
Dostoevsky and then also a lot about our

397
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Russian literary figure.
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who wrote a book 

398
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,310
called the Gulag archipelago,
which was one of the.

399
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
There was a few cataclysmic events that 
brought the totalitarian system of the 

400
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,560
Soviet Union to a halt and you can argue
about what they were,

401
00:20:46,561 --> 00:20:51,561
but one of them for sure,
what social needs and published 

402
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:52,780
publication of the Gulag Archipelago,
which is a 2,700

403
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:54,610
word book,
2,700

404
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,600
page book.

405
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,870
Can I get that right?
That describes what it was like to be 

406
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:04,540
there and how many people died and it's 
a.

407
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,960
it's a searing book you want to know 
about prize and he deserved it.

408
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:09,050
I mean,
Solzhenitsyn,

409
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,980
a remarkable person.
He's like the Dostoevsky of the 20th 

410
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,261
century and that's really saying 
something and Dostoevsky is another 

411
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:23,040
person I use a lot in that section and 
both Dostoevsky and niche and regard 

412
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,490
themselves as psychologists 
fundamentally.

413
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:30,491
And you know,
it's funny because when you think about 

414
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:30,491
scientists,
you know,

415
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:31,060
usually think about people who are 
conducting experiments,

416
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:33,370
right?
But then one of the things,

417
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:35,260
and you'll notice this,
if you think about it,

418
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,800
a lot of you have taken a fair number of
science courses are of one form or 

419
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:40,800
another.
And you know,

420
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,720
a lot of what you're taught when you're 
taught how to do science is how to 

421
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:45,720
generate,
you know,

422
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,150
how to lay out an experiment property,
how to get the methodology right,

423
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,210
how to do the analysis properly,
maybe how to structure the,

424
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,960
the revealing of your findings and 
proper scientific format,

425
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,030
you know,
and how to test a hypothesis.

426
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,640
But one of the things that you never 
really told about is,

427
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:05,641
well,
how the hell do you generate the 

428
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:05,641
hypotheses to begin with because you 
know,

429
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:09,630
really that's at least half the problem 
and it's probably a lot more than half 

430
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,611
the problem.
And so part of being a scientist is the 

431
00:22:14,611 --> 00:22:18,121
ability to be a hypothesis generator,
not just the hypothesis test or maybe 

432
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:19,780
you need to be both to be a true 
scientist,

433
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,560
but,
but maybe not.

434
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:26,080
Maybe you can just generate 
extraordinary hypothesis.

435
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:31,081
And it's certainly the case that people 
like Dostoevsky Nietzsche were 

436
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:32,710
unbelievably good hypotheses.
Generators.

437
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,760
And so,
you know,

438
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:38,080
they're thinking in many ways underlies 
the entire development of thought.

439
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,340
This sort of thought that you guys are 
going to encounter in university 

440
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,871
anyways.
They're thinking underlies the entire 

441
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:47,911
development of the edifice of,
I would say both scientific and 

442
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:49,990
nonscientific thought across the entire 
entire 20th century,

443
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,650
and so it's quite entertaining to go 
down there and wander around the roots 

444
00:22:56,171 --> 00:23:01,171
of these sorts of things because you 
find out how things are linked together 

445
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,610
and why they're linked together,
how they develop and what that means and

446
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,880
also what it means for you to have those
ideas and why you have them and what 

447
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:08,950
role they play in your life.

448
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,760
So.
Okay,

449
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,770
so after that,
that's pretty much in some sense you 

450
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,531
might think that's where the clinical 
and philosophical part of the course 

451
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:24,970
ends.
Now I'm a clinical psychologist and most

452
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:29,971
of the people who are great personality 
theorists were clinical psychologists 

453
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:33,511
and that explains to some degree wind.
The first part of the course is 

454
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:36,040
philosophical because the thing about 
clinical psychologists and psychiatrists

455
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:41,041
and medical doctors for that matter is 
that they're not exactly scientists.

456
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,680
They're more like engineers.
So what an engineer to do.

457
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:50,681
They might engineer,
might use scientific knowledge and you 

458
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:50,681
know,
good for them.

459
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:54,220
They should,
but really what they want to do is make 

460
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,220
something changed.
They want to build something.

461
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,530
They want to transform something.
They want to act on the world in a,

462
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,440
in a beneficial,
generally in a beneficial way.

463
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,580
While the same thing as the case with 
the health domains.

464
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,790
So like someone comes to you with a 
psychological problem.

465
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,590
What you want to do is you want to make 
it better and better is not a scientific

466
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:16,100
category.
So to the degree that you're a practice,

467
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,030
like you can say,
well,

468
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:19,460
it's scientific because worst means 
abnormal.

469
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:22,100
It's like that's not right.
You can make that case,

470
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:27,101
but it's shallow because there's lots of
times when you don't consider normal 

471
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:27,380
healthy,
you know,

472
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,660
you can send her exceptional,
healthy,

473
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:30,980
right,
or,

474
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:34,760
or maybe you consider exceptional,
desirable and desirable.

475
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:36,890
It might even be better than healthy,
right?

476
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:41,891
So you can't get out of the value domain
when you're trying to interact with 

477
00:24:41,891 --> 00:24:44,030
people and sort out their lives because 
partly what you're,

478
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,790
what you're always asking is what's 
wrong?

479
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,520
What's the matter?
Why are you dissatisfied?

480
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,100
Why are you suffering?
Why are you productive?

481
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:56,120
Why do you fight with everyone you know,
why can't you sleep at night?

482
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,910
Why do you wake up screaming,
you know,

483
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,870
why can't you pursue anything that's two
year old benefit?

484
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,530
Why do you hurt everyone that you know,
you know,

485
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,780
those are moral questions.
And then the next problem is,

486
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:10,250
okay,
well what are we gonna do about it?

487
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,280
What do you want?
How would you like your life to look if 

488
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,921
it could look the way you wanted it to?
And then how are we going to get from 

489
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:21,130
where you are to that?
And those are all their engineering 

490
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,551
questions in a sense,
but above all their ethical questions 

491
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:25,660
because they deal with how to act.
So you know,

492
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,790
I don't want to just slide over that big
because that's generally what happens 

493
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,800
because physicians and clinical 
psychologists and psychiatrists,

494
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:38,801
even though their physicians,
they like to think that what they're 

495
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:40,430
doing is science and that's not right.
It's informed by science,

496
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,200
but that's not the same thing.

497
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,200
It's particularly true with doctors 
because they're not even trained to be 

498
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,200
scientists.
So.

499
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,280
Alright,
so that's that.

500
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,070
So then the next part of the course,
the last half,

501
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,080
it's pretty,
it concentrates on two elements of 

502
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,070
personality theory,
more modern elements I would say,

503
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:03,071
although not more valuable necessarily 
because of that I'm partly very 

504
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,910
neurobiological because we made a lot of
strides in the last 5,000

505
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:12,260
years,
let's say,

506
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,200
in understanding the,
the,

507
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,860
the structure and the function of the 
brain.

508
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,840
Like the things we don't know about the 
brain,

509
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:22,400
man,
it's,

510
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,200
there are lots of things we don't 
understand about the brain.

511
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,860
We have no idea,
for example,

512
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:33,310
what its relationship is to 
consciousness except that more or less 

513
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,070
it seems necessary,
you know,

514
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,340
so all,
even even that you can dispute to some 

515
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,981
degree because they're great case 
histories of people who were born with 

516
00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:45,461
hydrocephalus.
And so that means that your skull 

517
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:45,461
basically fills with water.

518
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:49,380
And the most famous case of that was a 
French guy who,

519
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:54,381
uh,
went for an Mri for God only knows what 

520
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:57,231
reason.
It had nothing to do with with what was 

521
00:26:57,231 --> 00:26:59,751
eventually discovered,
but he only had five percent of his 

522
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,181
cortical tissue is whole brain has all 
head was full of cerebral spinal fluid 

523
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:07,550
and the brain was just a little skin 
around the side that was like a balloon 

524
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,340
and as far as they could tell,
there was nothing wrong with them.

525
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,080
It's like,
well,

526
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,660
isn't that interesting?
What the hell is all the riff that brain

527
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:15,150
for you know?
And then you get the other issue.

528
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:17,350
Like,
I don't know if you've ever heard of a.

529
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,080
can't remember her name.
I think it's peppered.

530
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,930
She had a famous parent,
an African gray.

531
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:29,280
You can look it up talking African gray 
parrot and that damn parent,

532
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:34,310
man,
that thing could talk like a four year 

533
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,310
old kid.

534
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,920
Way better than any chimpanzee full 
sentences.

535
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:37,830
It seemed to know what it was doing.
It's like it's apparent,

536
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,290
right?
It's brain is this big.

537
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,290
So how is that even possible?
So,

538
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:49,150
okay.
So there's lots of things we don't know 

539
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:49,150
about the brain really.
And it's unbelievably complicated.

540
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,230
So.
But we have learned a lot of things that

541
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:57,231
are interesting.
We kind of understand the existence and 

542
00:27:57,231 --> 00:27:59,550
the location of the fundamental reward 
and pain and anxiety circuits.

543
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:00,690
That's a big deal.
Those are,

544
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,910
those are like discovering major 
continents,

545
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:07,911
you know,
we understand to some degree how people 

546
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:09,420
learn and under what conditions they 
learn and we understand,

547
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,900
I would say to some degree what the 
fundamental motivations and emotions are

548
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,580
now.
Those are not scientific categories,

549
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:20,430
motivations and emotions,
their linguistic categories.

550
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:22,840
So what we're stuck with so,
but we,

551
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,890
we know a fair bit about their 
underlying neurobiological basis and I 

552
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,420
want to take you through that in some 
detail because for a bunch of reasons,

553
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,450
partly because it provides a nice 
scientific underpinning to a lot of the 

554
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,910
hypotheses and presuppositions of the 
cycle analysis.

555
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,050
You know,
so for example,

556
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,020
Freud hypothesized the existence of the 
end.

557
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,440
Now there is no way I didn't your brain,
but it doesn't really matter because the

558
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:52,441
ID,
the idea of the ID is a functional 

559
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:52,441
category.
It's like a tool.

560
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:54,120
But there are lots of end like 
structures in your brain,

561
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:59,630
you know,
and one of them in particular is the 

562
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,360
hypothalamus and that thing like human 
beings like to think that they're really

563
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:02,400
impressive.
Critical cap is the thing that's,

564
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:03,690
you know,
in charge of things.

565
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:08,691
But your hypothalamus,
which is this little tiny thing that 

566
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:11,781
sits at the top of your spinal cord man,
that's what's running you and let you 

567
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:17,151
know as long as you're not hungry or not
angry or not chasing after sexual 

568
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:19,500
excitement and not gambling and not 
addicted.

569
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:23,940
So as long as you're completely well fed
and warm and comfortable,

570
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:27,750
then you can think and you're more or 
less in control.

571
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:32,930
But as soon as any of those things go as
straight it's subcortical all the way 

572
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,690
you know.
And you can see this,

573
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:36,360
for example,
in conditions like Anorexia,

574
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,500
you know,
because the Anorexia,

575
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:41,530
you can think of Anorexia as a war 
between the cortex and the hypothalamus.

576
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:46,531
And I'll tell you then the only time the
cortex winds is when the anorexic dies.

577
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Because other than that,
it's the hypothalamus that wins all the 

578
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,691
time.
Which is why anorexics cannot stop 

579
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:54,691
themselves from bingeing,
you know,

580
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:58,790
so they'll,
they'll cut their body weight down to 

581
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,710
say 75 percent of what it should be and 
that's hard.

582
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,740
Like you really,
it's not easy to starve yourself like 

583
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,620
that,
but they'll still binge like mad,

584
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:10,621
you know,
we need a whole gallon of ice cream and 

585
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:10,621
two bags of bread and they can't stop 
themselves.

586
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:14,971
And that's because your hypothalamus 
flint would rather you didn't starve to 

587
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:14,971
death.

588
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:18,240
And if you're not paying attention,
if you're not on top of the game or 

589
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,680
maybe if you've been hurt recently and 
so your resources or your,

590
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,540
your,
what would you say?

591
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,690
You're the negative emotion that's been 
interfering with your cognitive 

592
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,141
capacity.
The hypothalamus will come up and grab 

593
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:31,141
you and say,
man,

594
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:31,370
you're hungry and it's off to the fridge
with you.

595
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,910
You know,
so two in the morning,

596
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:36,700
you're going to be eating everything in 
there in a kind of a daze.

597
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,170
And you'll snap out of that and think,
wow,

598
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:39,580
what the hell was that?
It was like,

599
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:44,581
well that's the end folks.
And it's no trivial thing and it's a 

600
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:46,480
good thing too because if it didn't tell
you what to do all the time,

601
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,520
like think about how foolish you are.
If you had to breathe voluntarily,

602
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:56,521
how,
how many days do you think you'd go 

603
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:56,521
through?

604
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,910
And it's like you wake up one day and an
hour later you'd forget to breathe and 

605
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,060
then you'd be dead.
So like your,

606
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,080
your,
your brain doesn't let you do anything 

607
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,621
important.
It takes care of all that in the 

608
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:07,621
background,
you know,

609
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:11,701
because you're just not that smart.
I mean you don't know how to digest 

610
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:11,701
things.
For example,

611
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:13,900
you actually don't know how you walk 
even though you can do it.

612
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,420
So there are very fundamental subsystem.
Some of them that aren't even conscious,

613
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,460
weirdly enough,
even though they're neurological,

614
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,640
they're doing all the heavy lifting and 
like your cortex is as long they're all 

615
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,850
along for the ride in some sense.
And that sort of things.

616
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,470
It's in control.
But yeah,

617
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,060
no,
not really.

618
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,990
Okay.
So we're going to talk a fair bit about 

619
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,480
fundamental brain structures and the 
function of those structures.

620
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,430
Because I like functional neuroanatomy.

621
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,410
I like,
I don't want to know just what the brain

622
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:46,411
is made out of,
but I want to know what all the parts 

623
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,241
are doing,
and so there's difficult papers in 

624
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:48,241
there.
Swanson,

625
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:51,100
that's a hard paper and the grit paper 
by gray,

626
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,790
those are papers that were written by I 
think genius level neuropsychologists 

627
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:01,230
and you know,
they put their whole life's work into a 

628
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,240
paper and so you know,
you shouldn't pick it up.

629
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,080
You're going to think,
wow,

630
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:03,100
this is hard.
It's like,

631
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:06,010
yeah,
some genius spent 30 years writing it.

632
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:09,430
It's going to be hard,
but they're so informative.

633
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:14,610
They're worth the struggle if,
if that's the sort of thing you want to 

634
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,360
struggle with.
So that's the biological end.

635
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:18,800
And then there's the psychometric ended 
site,

636
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,850
psychometrics,
very unpopular field of psychology even 

637
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,301
amongst psychologists.
And the reason for that is that 

638
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:29,670
psychometric nutrition's I guess have 
actually discovered things and people 

639
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,490
hate what they've discovered.

640
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,740
So and no wonder.
So for example,

641
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:35,870
it was people who do psychometrics,
engineers actually who in,

642
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,740
who entered psychology,
who discovered intelligence,

643
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,380
technical psychometric intelligence,
Iq.

644
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,430
And people will tell you there's lots of
kinds of intelligence.

645
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:46,190
It's like,
no,

646
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:48,440
there aren't.
That's wrong,

647
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:53,830
and it's wrong in this way.
The statistics that psychologists use 

648
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,030
were invented by the people who 
discovered Iq,

649
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,900
and that means every single thing that a
psychologist has ever claimed that's 

650
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,390
been verified in some way using some 
statistical process has been verified,

651
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,730
verified the same way that I knew was 
verified.

652
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,680
And so you don't get to say,
well,

653
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:14,681
the ICU stuffs in valid without saying 
all of psychology and a lot of other 

654
00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:16,370
fields is invalid too because it's the 
same methods of proof.

655
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:21,670
And it's even worse than that because 
like the relationship between Iq and 

656
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,661
life success is way stronger than the 
relationship between almost any other 

657
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:28,280
psychological phenomena and almost 
anything else.

658
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:31,020
So for example,
for you guys even know,

659
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,510
you know,
you're,

660
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,570
you're all far above average in 
intelligence because otherwise you 

661
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,090
wouldn't be here like at least 80,
fifth percentile.

662
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,360
And that's something to think about 
because a lot of that is determined by 

663
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,360
biological factors.
You know.

664
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,680
So a huge chunk of the reason that 
you're here is because you know,

665
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:50,681
you won the genetic lottery,
so like hooray for you and no one's 

666
00:33:50,681 --> 00:33:51,830
screwed it up too badly as you were 
growing up,

667
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,050
you know,
but even among you guys,

668
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,080
that correlation between your 
intelligence and your and your grade 

669
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,040
point average is quite high even though 
it's a truncated sample,

670
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:06,041
right?
Because you're all pretty bright and 

671
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:08,261
even though there's a lot of error in 
the grade measurement system because it 

672
00:34:08,261 --> 00:34:10,850
doesn't only index intelligence,
it's still very powerful.

673
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,980
And so the one,
the peep,

674
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,010
if you,
if you controlled for conscientious ness

675
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:21,011
and other elements of personality,
which you can do statistically in 20 

676
00:34:21,011 --> 00:34:25,061
years,
that the 10 percent of the people in 

677
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:25,910
this room who have the highest Iq is,
will have the highest income virtually.

678
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,110
Certainly,
you know,

679
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:29,180
unless some terrible thing happens to 
them,

680
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,420
you can overcome it to some degree if 
you're really hardworking because then 

681
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:34,550
that's conscientiousness,
you know,

682
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:39,551
and that.
But that's also a trait which seems to 

683
00:34:39,551 --> 00:34:39,560
have quite a heavy biological loading so
well.

684
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:43,220
So that's the sort of thing that people 
hate about psychometricians because they

685
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:48,221
come up with these facts and there are 
facts that are really dismal and I can 

686
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:49,520
give you an example.
So,

687
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:54,710
so you guys all have an Iq of over 150,
roughly speaking.

688
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,040
100 makes you about as smart as the 
typical high school reading 115.

689
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:04,870
That's kind of the low end for,
for managing the rigors of a,

690
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,220
a fairly high end university.
You know,

691
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,420
1:15,
you're still going to have a lot of 

692
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:13,420
trouble,
you're going to have to work like mad.

693
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:13,760
So,
but okay,

694
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:18,761
so 150.
Now that's one standard deviation above 

695
00:35:18,761 --> 00:35:18,770
the mean.

696
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,550
One standard deviation below the mean is
an Iq of 85.

697
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,580
Now there's just as many people out 
there in the world who have an Iq of 85 

698
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,760
as there are people who are able to go 
to college.

699
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:30,980
Okay?
So then you think,

700
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,700
what can you do if you have an Iq of 85 
and.

701
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,890
Well,
here's one answer.

702
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:42,891
So the US army has been doing 
psychometric testing for 100 and some 

703
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:42,891
years.
Um,

704
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:47,570
for a whole bunch of reasons,
but they've done a lot in the basic 

705
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:47,570
science,
you know,

706
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:51,140
and uh,
one thing about the u s army is they 

707
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,321
like to have recruits and you can 
understand why because do you really 

708
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,910
want to go off somewhere and get shot?
And the answer to that is generally no.

709
00:35:56,911 --> 00:36:01,911
So it's not like there were people 
lining up to get into the army even in 

710
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:01,911
peace time.

711
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:06,680
It's hard to get people.
And also the Americans have used the US 

712
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,140
army as a,
you know,

713
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:10,050
imagine you have a,
an underclass of people who aren't doing

714
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:15,051
very well,
which is the case in every society and 

715
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:15,051
you want to boost some of them up,
you know,

716
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:17,220
into something resembling the middle 
class.

717
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:22,430
You can do that fairly effectively by 
inducting the young men in particular 

718
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,000
into the army because they get some 
training,

719
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,140
you know,
they get some discipline and maybe they 

720
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,140
can kind clamber up into the middle 
class.

721
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,971
And so there's a lot of policy reasons.
A why the American army or enforces want

722
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,500
people and be,
you know,

723
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,170
just to be in the army.
But also for social reasons,

724
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,470
positive social reasons,
so they're not likely not to let you in 

725
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,480
the the consequences of 100 years of Iq 
testing was the PR was the establishment

726
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:49,200
of a law in the United States.

727
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,490
You cannot induct anyone into the army,
cannot accept them into the army.

728
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:57,990
If they have an Iq of less than 82,
that's 10 percent of the population.

729
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:04,130
So you think about that.
That means one person in 10 cannot do 

730
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,880
anything that is a positive value in an 
organization.

731
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:13,881
It's rather complex,
but not more complex than other 

732
00:37:13,881 --> 00:37:14,700
organizations.
That's desperate for people.

733
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,910
Nothing they can offer has positive 
value.

734
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,510
It's worse to have them in the army than
not to have them there at all.

735
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,170
Really.
Now you know that that's a terrible way 

736
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,170
of putting it,
but it's not.

737
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,300
It's a horrible.
It's a horrible statistic because it 

738
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:30,300
also means,
you know,

739
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,020
if you think about the army as roughly 
equivalent to the world in some sense,

740
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:39,021
in terms of its complexity,
it means that there's 10 percent of the 

741
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:42,270
population who just cannot really exist.
Well in a complex cognitive society.

742
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,700
So you might say,
well,

743
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,440
you know,
something should be done about that.

744
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:51,441
It's like good luck.
People had been trying to do something 

745
00:37:51,441 --> 00:37:52,680
about that for a very long time.
There's been billions,

746
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:57,681
if not trillions of dollars poured into 
attempts to do cognitive remediation in 

747
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:02,841
the United States.
Not to mention that we actually have an 

748
00:38:02,841 --> 00:38:03,990
education system and the cool is 
actually make people smarter.

749
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,830
So we're going to talk a lot about 
psychometrics.

750
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,400
And the thing about the psychometricians
is they're basically brute force 

751
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:13,990
statisticians in some ways they're 
atheoretical,

752
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,780
you know,
and they use computer power roughly 

753
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,461
speaking and advanced statistical 
techniques to look at large data sets 

754
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:23,210
and extract out patterns.
And you know,

755
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:28,211
I was,
I hated the big five when I first came 

756
00:38:28,211 --> 00:38:28,211
on it.
I thought,

757
00:38:28,211 --> 00:38:28,211
Oh God,
this is boring.

758
00:38:28,211 --> 00:38:31,020
It's like there's no theory behind it.
It's not prescriptive,

759
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,570
it's not interested in any literary 
manner.

760
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,650
Like it doesn't have a good story.
Um,

761
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,800
it came out of,
it's so dry,

762
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,050
but you know,
it works.

763
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,760
And,
and that's,

764
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:48,160
that's how it is.
So we're going to spend a lot of time on

765
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:53,161
psychometrics and you know,
my lab two has done a fair bit of work 

766
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:54,910
over the last 10 years elaborating out 
the big five models.

767
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:59,911
So one of the things we'll talk about is
the big 10 model and what it does 

768
00:38:59,911 --> 00:39:01,840
roughly speaking,
is break each of the five into two,

769
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:07,140
we call them aspects and they're pretty 
interesting like they predict political 

770
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,140
belief for example,
quite nicely.

771
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,600
So conservatives tend to be more 
orderly,

772
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,330
which is part of conscientiousness and 
less creative,

773
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,680
less open and liberals tend to be more 
open and less conscientious,

774
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,800
which a cynic would say.
That's why they're so into income 

775
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:22,840
redistribution because they actually 
don't work.

776
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,380
So you know,
the conservatives work like mad and the 

777
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:28,380
liberals say,
hey,

778
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:28,750
how about some of that money,
you know,

779
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,060
the system is unfair.
And the Conservatives say,

780
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:36,061
well no,
we worked hard and we're not giving you 

781
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:36,061
any.
Well,

782
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:37,540
you know,
they both have flaws in their theories.

783
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,390
But liberals by the way,
make very good entrepreneurs like.

784
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,830
No,
let me rephrase that.

785
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Most entrepreneurs are liberal in their 
political outlook and that's because 

786
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:52,531
they're high in openness.
So the way it really seems to work is 

787
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:54,550
that liberal minded people start 
businesses and conservatives run the.

788
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,890
So they're necessary for one another.
Yeah.

789
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,390
Well,
because the liberals being open,

790
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:00,920
they're often the next idea,
you know,

791
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,370
and they don't want to attend to the 
damn details.

792
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:05,650
They get bored by that.
They're not particularly orderly,

793
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,680
you know,
but once you've established a process 

794
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,261
and it works,
you need someone to watch to make sure 

795
00:40:13,261 --> 00:40:15,550
the process keeps working well,
that's not very interesting if you're a 

796
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:15,550
creative person.
So.

797
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:20,490
Okay,
so that's basically that.

798
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:26,040
That's the course.
So now what are we doing time here?

799
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,630
So I think what I'll do now is I'm going
to tell you a story and you're going to 

800
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,170
think it has absolutely nothing to do 
with what we've been talking about,

801
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,540
but it.
But that's okay.

802
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:46,080
That's okay.
So I picked this weird picture.

803
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,260
It's the picture of Jonah Biblical 
character,

804
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,600
so 2,500
year old story.

805
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,190
So that's a pretty old story.
And generally if a story is 2,500

806
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,170
years old,
it's a lot older than that,

807
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,440
you know,
it's just happened to be written down 

808
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:07,440
2,500
years ago.

809
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,260
But no,
that long ago it wasn't like there were 

810
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,560
novels and books and that you could find
50 different stories,

811
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,880
you know,
at your fingertips.

812
00:41:12,881 --> 00:41:17,881
There were a few stories and everyone 
knew them and God only knows how long 

813
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:17,881
they been around,
but it was a very,

814
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:18,610
very,
very,

815
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:21,850
very long time.
So this was written down 2,500

816
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:22,270
years ago.

817
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,730
But we don't really have any idea how 
old it is.

818
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:29,950
And in some sense it's,
it's almost infinitely old at least on 

819
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:35,851
any human scale.
Now you see this picture and what you 

820
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:37,040
see is this thing that,
what would you call it?

821
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:42,610
Well,
it's a medieval idea of a whale is what 

822
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:42,610
it is.
You know,

823
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:46,361
when you might think,
well that isn't really what a whale 

824
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:48,041
looks like and that's kind of right.
But a medieval Wale wasn't the whale 

825
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:53,021
that we have.
Like whale in medieval times meant 

826
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:54,410
large,
terrifying underwater thing,

827
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:59,810
you know?
And so maybe that was maybe a giant 

828
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,640
squid was a whale and the whale was a 
whale in the shark was a whale,

829
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,170
you know,
the categories not to save.

830
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:08,590
So that kind of accounts for the.
That in pure ignorance is what accounts 

831
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:11,990
for the kind of strange mythologized 
representation.

832
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,390
But it's still a representation of 
something.

833
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:19,130
It's just a little generalized.
Now what he's doing is vomiting Jonah up

834
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:21,230
onto dry land.
So.

835
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,040
And you think that's pretty damn weird.
How many of you have Seen Pinocchio?

836
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,590
That's a lot.
Hey,

837
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,250
how many of you haven't really.
You Haven't Seen Pinocchio?

838
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,930
What kind of parents did you have?
Anything?

839
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,360
Okay,
Well Are you Remembering Pinocchio?

840
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,870
Pinocchio.
Father stuck in,

841
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:43,871
away away.
And then Pinocchio asked to go down 

842
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:45,941
there and rescue them.
And one of the things you didn't notice 

843
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:47,990
when you were watching Pinocchio is just
how daft that is.

844
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:52,991
There you are sitting there,
you're watching a puppet go down into 

845
00:42:52,991 --> 00:42:55,610
the ocean to rescue his father from a 
whale.

846
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,910
And you think that makes sense.
It's like,

847
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,370
well,
so that's interesting.

848
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,450
Right?
That's interesting.

849
00:43:02,451 --> 00:43:06,530
Why does that make sense?
Why does that make sense?

850
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,200
Because it doesn't make any sense,
but,

851
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,550
but,
but see,

852
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:15,570
that's a,
that's a good example of the grip of an 

853
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,101
archetypal idea because in archetipal 
ideas a very deep and old idea that 

854
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:23,201
makes sense to you even though if 
someone points out to you that you 

855
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:26,141
believe it,
which more or less do while you're 

856
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:26,141
watching the movie you think,
Oh yeah,

857
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:30,611
it's really weird that I believe that's 
like kill and that isn't a puppet going 

858
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:33,890
down into the ocean to rescue his father
from a whale either.

859
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:38,890
Just so you know it.
It's a drawing of a puppet going down 

860
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:38,890
into the ocean to rescue is far from a 
whale.

861
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:43,490
So it's like divorced from reality,
my life in all sorts of ways.

862
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:48,491
But what's so interesting is you go into
the theater and watch something like 

863
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:51,911
that there.
If someone taps you on the shoulder and 

864
00:43:51,911 --> 00:43:51,911
say,
Hey,

865
00:43:51,911 --> 00:43:51,911
do you know what you're doing?
You say,

866
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:54,140
why don't you shut up and let me watch 
the movie.

867
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,750
Right?
You don't notice.

868
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,240
Oh yes.
I'm very peculiar.

869
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,360
Very peculiar thing sitting here 
watching this and not noticing how 

870
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:02,360
strange I am,
you know,

871
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,100
and so,
well,

872
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,250
that's partly why I'm going to tell you 
this story because.

873
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:11,470
Because it's true even though it isn't,
you know,

874
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,010
and that's,
that's a funny thing.

875
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:18,190
I had a very,
very strange professor at the University

876
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,480
of Alberta.
He died a few years ago.

877
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:25,481
He got on a bus,
I think it was in Winnipeg and he never 

878
00:44:25,481 --> 00:44:25,481
got off the bus and no one ever saw him 
again.

879
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,710
So he had,
he'd been a prison psychologist.

880
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:30,740
He worked in the maximum security prison
in University of Alberta.

881
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:34,830
So who maybe he met one of his old 
clients,

882
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:35,700
you know,
it's possible,

883
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:37,680
but it's very strange.
Very strange ending.

884
00:44:37,681 --> 00:44:41,430
Anyways,
one time we were talking about fiction,

885
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:42,240
you know,
and he said,

886
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:47,650
uh,
he said fiction is a lie that can tell 

887
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,841
you the truth.
That's a very interesting way of 

888
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:50,841
thinking about it,
you know,

889
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:54,360
because you read fiction and you know 
it's true,

890
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,840
but it's not obviously because it's not 
really about a thing that actually 

891
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,741
happened,
but it's more than that some ways 

892
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:06,501
because if it's good fixture it's about 
a whole bunch of things that happened 

893
00:45:06,501 --> 00:45:06,960
sort of like that.
Right?

894
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:11,250
It's a distillation.
It's like someone tells you a long story

895
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,720
and then you know,
you,

896
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,750
you,
you talked to your partner and they 

897
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,150
asked you what was that all about and 
then you tell them in two sentences what

898
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:18,630
it was about.

899
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,520
You boil it down to the just,
right.

900
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:25,790
Well a really good story is the gist of 
something and some of the really old 

901
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:28,500
stories,
the really weird ones like Jonah and the

902
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:30,770
whale for example,
which as I said is,

903
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:33,740
is told to some degree in the story of 
Pinocchio there,

904
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:38,750
the gist of a lot of things and people 
have been boiling those damn stories 

905
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,140
down for,
for a very,

906
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:40,890
very,
very,

907
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:41,880
very,
very,

908
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,940
very long period of time.
Thousands of people over thousands of 

909
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:52,130
years and they come up with these weird 
stories that people remember and then 

910
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:52,500
people think,
well,

911
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:53,310
they're real.
It's like,

912
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:53,910
yeah,
they are,

913
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:56,220
but they're not real.
The way of scientific story is real.

914
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:58,020
It's a different kind of real.
So here's,

915
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,220
here's the story of Jonah.

916
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:07,610
So it's an old Jewish story.
There's probably a very intimidating in 

917
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,670
the Korean,
but I don't know that variance.

918
00:46:10,671 --> 00:46:12,150
So,
and maybe there isn't.

919
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:17,040
Anyways,
Joe Lives in 500 BC and uh,

920
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,980
God has a chat with them one day and he 
says,

921
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:21,240
look,
Jonah there,

922
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,620
there's this city,
Nineveh,

923
00:46:22,621 --> 00:46:24,710
and the people there,
you know,

924
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:30,320
they're really not on the straight and 
narrow and things are going to go to 

925
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,940
hell in a handbasket very rapidly if 
someone doesn't do something about that.

926
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:35,730
So I think that you should go to Nineveh
and you should tell the king and all the

927
00:46:35,731 --> 00:46:37,530
people that are there that are really 
there,

928
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:42,780
they're just not doing the right thing.
And Jonah being a perfectly intelligent 

929
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,240
person says,
you want me to go to a city and you want

930
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:49,490
to go meet me to tell the king like this
authoritarian die who has absolute power

931
00:46:49,491 --> 00:46:54,491
of everything,
that there's something wrong with what 

932
00:46:54,491 --> 00:46:54,491
he's doing,
that all of the citizens are corrupt.

933
00:46:54,491 --> 00:46:56,070
That's what you want me to do.
And Jonah says,

934
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,500
there's no way I'm doing that because as
I said,

935
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:03,530
he's a smart guy.
So he runs off and he goes to this town 

936
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:07,601
and and as he's reading off,
he rents a boat more or less than it's 

937
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:11,820
big boat.
And there's fishermen and they're gonna 

938
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:11,820
like him somewhere.
God can't find them,

939
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,840
which is not going to be an easy thing.
And so god of course cannot be fooled by

940
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:20,490
such relatively poorer strategic choices
because he's omniscient and all that.

941
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,700
So he's out on the water Jonah and 
there's the fisherman there.

942
00:47:23,701 --> 00:47:26,290
And then some God calls up this big 
storm and up.

943
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,400
The fishermen are shorting out about 
this and because they're going to swamp 

944
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,651
the boat and then they're all going to 
die and they're not that happy about 

945
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,081
that.
So what they decided to do is throw 

946
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:37,081
everything overboard so that the boat is
lightened,

947
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:38,860
but that doesn't help much because the 
storm gets worse.

948
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,210
And so then all of them start praying.
They all have different gods.

949
00:47:42,211 --> 00:47:44,620
So you know,
it's like a little God competition.

950
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:49,840
One fishermen talks to one God,
another fisherman talks to another God 

951
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,221
and nothing's happening.
So Joe and it happens to be asleep in 

952
00:47:53,221 --> 00:47:57,091
the hold of the ship.
Now he's already told them that he's 

953
00:47:57,091 --> 00:47:57,091
been running from his God and so they 
think,

954
00:47:57,091 --> 00:48:02,011
ha,
we'd better go wake up Jonah because 

955
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:02,011
maybe he's the guy that's causing all 
the trouble.

956
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:04,970
So they'd go down there and they wake 
them up and they asked him about his God

957
00:48:04,971 --> 00:48:06,010
and he says,
well,

958
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:08,890
my God made the heavens and the earth 
and their gods,

959
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:10,660
they weren't doing anything that 
magnificence.

960
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:12,100
So they're pretty freaked out about 
this.

961
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:17,101
And so they tell Jonas like,
what the hell are you running away from 

962
00:48:17,101 --> 00:48:17,101
this guy for it?
It's not a good idea.

963
00:48:17,101 --> 00:48:18,100
And Jonah says,
yeah,

964
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:23,101
yeah,
I'm sure it's my fault that this storm 

965
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:25,081
has come up.
So why don't you just throw me over and 

966
00:48:25,081 --> 00:48:25,081
they say,
well,

967
00:48:25,081 --> 00:48:25,081
we can't really do that because you 
know,

968
00:48:25,081 --> 00:48:28,360
you shouldn't run away like that,
but you're not a murderer or anything,

969
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:33,361
we can't just toss you over.
And so they decided to try to row to 

970
00:48:33,361 --> 00:48:33,700
shore,
but God's not having any of that.

971
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:36,460
So he raises up a big storm and it's 
getting worse and worse.

972
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:38,170
And finally the fishermen say,
Oh,

973
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,420
you know,
over you go in,

974
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:44,770
join is into that because he knows he's 
a bad guy and so away all swallows them.

975
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,320
Now you think,
hmm,

976
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,990
that's probably not exactly right 
because first if a whale swallowed you,

977
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,930
then you'd be dead.
And it was probably a shark anyways.

978
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,270
It's not like you're going to be driving
down there.

979
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,990
It's not a big cavern.
Like,

980
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,780
you know the Pinocchio Whale,
it's,

981
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,650
it's solid and there's no oxygen.
So your dad.

982
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:04,900
But that isn't what happens.
Jonah's in the whale.

983
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,320
And he's Kinda freaked out by this 
because now he's in a whale and there's 

984
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,801
a storm in God's angry at him.
So the first thing he does is pray and 

985
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:14,620
tell God what an idiot he isn't,
that he'd like to be forgiven,

986
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:18,850
and so the whale zips up to shore and 
vomit some onto the beach,

987
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:23,851
which is the very,
very undignified mode of arriving 

988
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:24,730
anywhere.
So,

989
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,760
so that's,
that's the Jonah Story.

990
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:30,430
And then of course Jonah picks himself 
up and he thinks,

991
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,300
yeah,
yeah.

992
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:32,980
You know,
that wasn't so good.

993
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:37,981
It was a little rough.
I think maybe I'm going off to Nineveh 

994
00:49:37,981 --> 00:49:40,381
to tell the ninevites or whoever they 
were that they're just not living 

995
00:49:40,381 --> 00:49:42,160
properly because that's a lot better 
than making God angry,

996
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:47,170
you know,
because what with the storms and the 

997
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:47,170
fishermen and the whales and all that.

998
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,640
So then he goes off to Nineveh and he 
tells them what's going on in it seems 

999
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,760
to more or less work.
So.

1000
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,940
So that's a very interesting story and 
you think,

1001
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:56,470
well,
how did people believe that?

1002
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,540
Me?
And one question might be,

1003
00:49:58,541 --> 00:49:59,950
well,
do you believe that story?

1004
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,730
And then you think,
well no,

1005
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:09,090
but then you think,
well maybe that's more complex question 

1006
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:09,700
than you might think because it turns 
out that I believe the Pinocchio Story.

1007
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,350
And you say,
well no,

1008
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:13,660
I didn't really believe it.
And then I would say,

1009
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,940
well it kind of depends on what you mean
by bleed,

1010
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:20,970
doesn't it?
Because you watched it and while you 

1011
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:20,970
were watching it,
man,

1012
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,210
you were into it,
you understood it,

1013
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:24,550
you didn't want it to be disrupted,
you followed it.

1014
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,320
So it's like,
did you believe it?

1015
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:32,410
No.
You were like a four year old skeptic 

1016
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:32,410
sitting there thinking,
well,

1017
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:32,410
you know,
pop it whale.

1018
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:32,680
No,
it doesn't add up.

1019
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:38,020
You're not.
You're acting out your belief in it by 

1020
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,211
being engaged in it.
And if someone taps you on the shoulder 

1021
00:50:40,211 --> 00:50:41,270
and wakes you up 30 years later,
20 years later you say,

1022
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,310
oh no,
I don't believe that.

1023
00:50:42,311 --> 00:50:43,820
It's like,
you know,

1024
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,420
it's kind of remarkable what you'll 
believe.

1025
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,350
You know,
how many of you are star wars?

1026
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:51,190
Like Aficionados?
No,

1027
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,200
you won't admit it,
will you?

1028
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,280
But there's lots of you in here.
I know.

1029
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,590
You know.
And so that's all mythology,

1030
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:59,300
all mythology,
you know,

1031
00:50:59,301 --> 00:51:01,400
that of course the person who,
uh,

1032
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,220
what was his name,
the guy who came up with star wars idea,

1033
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:07,040
Lucas Lucas was a student of Joseph 
Campbell.

1034
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,910
Joseph Campbell was a psychologist slash
mythologist.

1035
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,510
And The star wars stories are updated 
mythology,

1036
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:19,511
just like Harry Potter and all the other
things that capture people's 

1037
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:19,670
imagination.
So you bloody well do believe this.

1038
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:25,570
And there's a reason for it to now.
What time is it now?

1039
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,160
We'll stop there.
I'll tell you the reason.

1040
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:29,000
The next time we meet.
