1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,380
Okay,
so we're going to wrap up.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,410
Freud today,
so occupies a strange position in the 

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,380
history of psychology because Freud 
wasn't a psychologist.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,440
He was a medical doctor and many of the 
people whose theories were discussing 

5
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:32,240
that work clinicians were mds,
not psychologists well,

6
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:35,820
and of course when Freud was around,
at least when he was trading psychology,

7
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,040
hadn't yet become an independent 
science.

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,850
Now the same was true of Yom,
and part of the consequence of that was 

9
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,901
that when the new science of psychology 
developed into what you're studying 

10
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:52,701
today,
the psychoanalysts and the medical 

11
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:56,061
community basically stayed outside of 
that and there's never really been a 

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,250
meeting of the minds between 
experimental psychologists and 

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,570
psychoanalysts.
Although by the 19 eighties,

14
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,290
the cognitive psychologists were 
promoting their discovery of the 

15
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,281
cognitive unconscious,
which always felt to me a little bit 

16
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,390
ungrateful given that Freud had actually
laid the groundwork for the theory of 

17
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,060
the unconscious or an elaborated that in
quite great detail.

18
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,530
You know,
almost 100 years before there's some 

19
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,780
resistance in this.
And that's what a psychoanalyst would 

20
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,541
say.
There is some resistance among the 

21
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,181
experimental psychology community to 
Credit Freud with any of his real 

22
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:36,960
discoveries and I think that's very 
unfortunate,

23
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,990
partly because he did make the 
discoveries and be the psychoanalysts 

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,080
still understand more about the nature 
of the unconscious than modern 

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,651
experimental psychologists because 
modern experimental psychologists insist

26
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,340
on viewing the brain as that cognitive 
processes.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,260
Something like a computer and that isn't
what it is.

28
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:03,261
It's a living system composed of other 
living subsystems and that means that as

29
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:10,611
we've discussed already,
that the human psyche and its 

30
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:15,110
subordinate components are better 
conceived of as personalities and 

31
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,370
subpersonalities than in any other 
manner.

32
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:22,371
Then in systems or an or an information 
or that information processing machines 

33
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,760
and it's.
It's,

34
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,850
it's I think perhaps the most 
fundamental accomplishment of 

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,800
psychoanalysis following me actually to 
view the human mind,

36
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:38,991
the human psyche as a place of 
relatively integrated subpersonalities 

37
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,410
being when even when modern people talk 
about themselves,

38
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:51,411
they talk about the eye,
which would be roughly the ego in 

39
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:51,411
Freudian terms.

40
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:53,580
They tend to think of themselves as a 
unitary phenomenon.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,240
But the problem with that notion is that
people continually do things that they 

42
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:05,851
find themselves doing things that in 
principle they don't want to do or 

43
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:08,050
things that they're ashamed of or lying 
when they don't want a liar,

44
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,260
generally misbehaving,
and so also of course everybody's 

45
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,800
observations that you can try to tell 
yourself what to do,

46
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,010
but that doesn't work very well.
So you know you've experienced this 

47
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,560
undoubtedly in your own life.
Many,

48
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:24,040
many times when you're sitting down and 
you're trying to study for something,

49
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,290
particularly if you're not very 
interested in it,

50
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,730
they had all sorts of alternative 
possibilities will make themselves 

51
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,070
manifest in your,
in the theater of your,

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,460
of your imagination,
and in a sense what's happening in in 

53
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,661
those situations is that parts of you 
that that are organized,

54
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,740
organized around other goals or from the
Friday perspective,

55
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:52,741
say driven by other desires,
are trying to hijack control of your 

56
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:58,891
motor output and that frequently happens
so that you find yourself,

57
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,820
for example,
procrastinating or rationalizing or 

58
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,180
displacing.

59
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,480
Those are all Freudian concepts at 
displacement would be,

60
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,550
instead of doing the work you're 
supposed to do,

61
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,830
you go off and do some other work.
No,

62
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,850
it's not a bad way of procrastinating,
but it's not great because you're not 

63
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:25,201
focusing on what you should be focusing 
on and so in some sense you're at war 

64
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:27,910
with yourself and the major player in 
the war,

65
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:32,911
at least in principle,
is the ego not be equivalent to Freud's 

66
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:37,021
conscious mind.
At least in the initial phases of his 

67
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:39,811
theory.
It's somewhat complicated to talk about 

68
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,211
Freud because of course it's theory 
developed across time and then in the 

69
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:46,021
beginning he basically broke the mind up
into the conscious mind and the 

70
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:47,530
unconscious mind and you can think of 
the conscious mind.

71
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,070
Well that's you.
Essentially that's the you that you can 

72
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,071
refer to during day to day experience 
and then the unconscious mind is a 

73
00:04:56,071 --> 00:05:00,781
storehouse of two broad classes of 
phenomena and one would be drives that 

74
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:10,201
are grounded in instinct that are either
at odds with your current goal or 

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,120
memories often traumatic that you 
haven't been able to integrate into your

76
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,410
conscious framework.

77
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,020
And so those pesky things take on their 
own life.

78
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,060
You know,
if you,

79
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,690
if you take an animal and you take out 
increasingly large segments of its 

80
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,770
cortex,
say the animal still organizes itself 

81
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,730
into that animal,
like it starts to lose function,

82
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,770
especially if you go deep into the brain
and you can kill an animal if you go 

83
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,150
deep into the brain.
But if you stay on the cortical surface,

84
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:51,151
you can take an awful lot of brain 
tissue out without interfering with a 

85
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,750
lot of the animal's ability to sustain 
itself.

86
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:56,590
And what that shows is that the brain is
organized in such a way.

87
00:05:56,591 --> 00:06:01,591
So that isolated components of it will 
take on a function of the entire 

88
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:06,791
personality and that demonstration in 
some sense that these sub elements of 

89
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,380
the psyche or or perhaps subsystems,
subsystems of the brain can organize 

90
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,900
themselves into functional living units.

91
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,210
And it stands to reason.
I mean if you lose an arm,

92
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:22,211
you don't start functioning.
You just reorganize your personality 

93
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:22,550
minus the arm.
And if you,

94
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,720
you.
If,

95
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,840
if you have only managed to integrate a 
certain subset of the potential psychic 

96
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:33,971
manifestations of your mind,
then that subset is going to formulate 

97
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:39,221
the main personality,
but all the other things that you're 

98
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:39,221
ignoring,
their can't integrate.

99
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:39,221
They're going to have a life of their 
own.

100
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,440
They don't just disappear,
and so Freud offers the unsettling idea 

101
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,560
that you're by no means master in your 
own house,

102
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,100
and one of the ways you can determine 
that is by watching yourself do things 

103
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,810
that you don't want to do,
and those are things,

104
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,150
for example,
that you'd have a hard time facing up to

105
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,180
because of course,
most of the things that you don't want 

106
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,030
to do are things that you might be 
ashamed of or anxious about.

107
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,660
And then of course there's the defeat 
that you suffer when you.

108
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,960
When your ego is hypothetically in 
control of this circumstance and you 

109
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,051
find your behavior or your thoughts 
directed in some direction under the 

110
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:20,990
control of something that you think that
you've mastered.

111
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,960
You can really see this in conditions 
like anorexia.

112
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,140
So especially if it's accompanied by 
Bulemia,

113
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:29,770
which it often is.
So anorexia is a.

114
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,110
An eating disorder that causes people,
I think essentially become extremely 

115
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,281
disgusted with their own physiology,
with their own physical being and it 

116
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:42,620
works their perceptions terribly.
So I had a,

117
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,760
uh,
an anorexic client at one point and she 

118
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,560
was a rather small woman of maybe five 
to or something like that.

119
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Quite thin.
Obviously she had anorexia and I asked 

120
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,870
her when she was in my office if her 
thigh was bigger or smaller than mine.

121
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,690
And she said,
well it was about the same size.

122
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,960
So I took a piece of paper and I'm 
saddle on it and I drew the outline of 

123
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,840
my thigh on it.
And then I had her sit on the same piece

124
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:14,300
of paper and she drew the outline of her
thigh.

125
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:17,240
And of course there was probably that 
much space on both sides.

126
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:22,241
Between the two outlines,
which probably looked at that for 15 

127
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:22,241
minutes,
you know,

128
00:08:22,241 --> 00:08:26,800
she,
she could not believe that that could 

129
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,081
possibly be the case.
And I think what happens in our 

130
00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:31,160
anorexics is that they stopped being 
able to look up their whole bodies.

131
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,280
So when you,
when you look at yourself in the mirror,

132
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,090
you kind of have to look in a gestalt 
manner.

133
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:43,091
You have to get a picture of the whole.
Alternatively you can focus on small 

134
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:45,140
parts,
but the more you focus on parts,

135
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:50,141
the more difficult it is to see the 
parts in relationship to the whole and 

136
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:54,790
anorexics get unbelievably focused on 
small elements and they confuse 

137
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,890
themselves.

138
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,890
So for example,
if they're looking at their arms and 

139
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,331
there's some flesh on it,
they they are unable to make a 

140
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:06,040
distinction between the flesh and fat 
and they want no fat.

141
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,980
They want to go right down to the bone 
and they can't because they're concerned

142
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:15,981
about that tiny little part or maybe 
this tiny little park or wherever they 

143
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:19,851
happen to be focused there.
They get completely unable to perceive 

144
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,340
their own bodies and it's quite striking
how,

145
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
how far that can go.
And then the end of it is,

146
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,750
well,
the person will start themselves for a 

147
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,300
long period of time and of course we'll 
think about this and modern 

148
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,361
physiological terms.
Feeding behavior is regulated by the 

149
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:38,670
hypothalamus.
And that's a.

150
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,760
that's an ancient brain area that 
controls fundamental motivational 

151
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,510
systems and it's right above the spinal 
cord and it's a very,

152
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:50,511
very,
very powerful center of Control and the 

153
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:50,511
brain.

154
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:51,270
It's functional enough.
I think I told you this before,

155
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:56,271
that if you take a cat and you take off 
it's entire cortex and even most of its 

156
00:09:56,271 --> 00:10:00,741
emotional systems,
if you leave it just with the 

157
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:02,631
hypothalamus and the spinal cord,
which basically means it has almost no 

158
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:05,691
brain.
It can organize its behavior almost 

159
00:10:05,691 --> 00:10:05,730
perfectly as long as you keep it in a 
simple environment.

160
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,230
So anyways,
the anorexic attempts to starve,

161
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,250
but so that's a conscious goal you might
say or or that might be an ego related 

162
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:22,191
goal or you could even think about it as
a goal that's motivated by other 

163
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:25,881
unconscious forces because maybe she 
doesn't know exactly why she wants to 

164
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:25,920
start,
but in any case,

165
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,430
what generally happens is she'll run 
into an emotionally upsetting situation.

166
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,520
Now,
emotional upset,

167
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,250
say it.
It makes you anxious or it puts you in 

168
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:41,250
emotional pain.

169
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,540
That activates higher brain centers.
Then the hypothalamus,

170
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:47,541
but they're still pretty low.
They're still pretty primordial and one 

171
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,240
of the things that kind of emotional 
upset does,

172
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,330
let's call it stress,
is shut off your longterm planning and 

173
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,531
the reason for that is,
is that if you're stressed in the in 

174
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:57,531
the,
in,

175
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,790
in the immediate,
now your body and brain presume that you

176
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:04,791
should devote divert resources from the 
hypothetical future to solving the 

177
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:10,191
problem that's right in front of you and
that's often a more behaviorally 

178
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:13,140
oriented a solution like freezing or 
withdrawing or something like that.

179
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,710
So it shuts off your prefrontal cortex.
And as soon as that happens,

180
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,930
then the hypothalamus,
which is,

181
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,990
as I said,
a very powerful system just reaches up 

182
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,601
in some sense and dominates the person.
I mean it's been there for God only 

183
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:27,390
knows how long,
you know,

184
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,580
tens of millions of years and it's job 
is to stop you from starving to death.

185
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,580
And you know,
you can imagine that over the course of 

186
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,041
evolutionary history,
anybody who had a relatively weak 

187
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,770
feeding instinct died and so they 
weren't our ancestors.

188
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:48,771
And so what happens to the Balsamic is 
something will upset them and then 

189
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:53,300
they'll get an uncontrollable desire.
For often something that's high calorie 

190
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,891
and sweet and full of fat,
logically enough because they're 

191
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,631
starving and then they'll eat like a 
whole quart of ice cream and two loaves 

192
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:01,660
of bread and you know,
they described the state that they're in

193
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,510
while they're doing that as dissociated,
you know,

194
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:07,180
it doesn't feel like them.
Well,

195
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,270
you can imagine why in some sense,
I mean partly is the whole realm of 

196
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,130
eating behavior and it eating is as some
personality.

197
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,110
It's not just a behavior.
It's not a drive.

198
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,810
Like when you think about when you're 
hungry,

199
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,990
it's not like your brain is moving.

200
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,990
You literally step by determined step.
It's that you start fantasizing about 

201
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:30,940
food and you start thinking about what 
you may be wanted.

202
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:35,941
Then you start to make plans about where
you're going to go or how you're going 

203
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:36,260
to cook and what social.
You know,

204
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,030
what social surround there's going to be
in a whole bunch of things and that's,

205
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,800
that's the hungry you well in an,
in an anorexic or Bulimic,

206
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,840
the hungry part of the person is so 
dissociated from the part,

207
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,210
the ego apart,
but they're basically in a war.

208
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:57,211
But one of the problems with being in a 
war with your hypothalamus is that it 

209
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:59,260
almost always wins and it's a good thing
because otherwise you die,

210
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,710
you know,
and lots of anorexics do manage to 

211
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,661
starve themselves to death.
And so that's a good example of just 

212
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,690
exactly how dissociable the mind can be 
in the mind is,

213
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,020
is also the brain is dissociable in the 
strangest possible ways.

214
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,790
So here's an example.
Um,

215
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,550
I don't remember the name of this 
syndrome.

216
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:22,780
It might pop into my mind,
but so you can have a particular kind of

217
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,810
stroke.
And here's the effect of the stroke.

218
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,740
You develop the fixed delusion that a 
person who's very close to you capgras 

219
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:38,101
syndrome,
a person who's very close to you has 

220
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:41,641
been,
has died or being kidnapped or somehow 

221
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:42,940
disappeared and has been replaced by 
their exact double.

222
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,380
And so and so.
It's obviously something,

223
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,040
it manifests itself as something akin to
psychosis.

224
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,490
And what happens is that the stroke 
damages the relationship between the 

225
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,250
generally,
the visual systems that identify faces 

226
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,580
and the emotional systems that tag the 
identified face with familiar emotions.

227
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:10,861
So basically what happens is,
let's say it happens to you and it's 

228
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:10,861
your mother,
you look at your mother,

229
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,670
but it isn't your mother,
you know,

230
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:17,671
your mother comes with a whole complex 
of memories and you know she's sat in a,

231
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,720
in a very broad context of memory and 
emotion and then you look at this person

232
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:25,150
and it looks like your mother,
but none of that is happening.

233
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,610
And so then you develop this idea as 
well.

234
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:29,920
If it's not my mother,
it looks exactly like my mother.

235
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:31,870
Well then what could possibly be going 
on?

236
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,871
And the answer is,
well obviously she's being taken away 

237
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:41,221
and replaced by her exact duplicate.
People get into real trouble with this 

238
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:43,540
sort of delusion as you might imagine 
because they get obsessed with trying to

239
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,210
solve the problem.
Like what did you do with my mother?

240
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,340
And you can understand why,
but here's the,

241
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,470
here's a weirder thing even which is 
that it's,

242
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,960
it's modality specific so that if they 
listen to their mother on the phone,

243
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,360
that's their mother.
So.

244
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,390
So you see exactly how dissociable the 
brain is.

245
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,140
The mind is even down to small sub 
functions,

246
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:10,310
so there are people with strokes who can
sing but who can't talk,

247
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,520
and there are people who lose nouns and 
there are people who lose only versed 

248
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,120
and there are people who can identify 
things but they can't name them.

249
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,690
So the idea that the brain is a 
dissociable entity is obviously correct.

250
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,490
And here's another example of it,
while you dissociate all the time.

251
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Now,
if you look at the way the brain is 

252
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,241
structured,
so there's a strip right about here 

253
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:40,601
called the motor strip,
and if you are doing brain surgery and 

254
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:41,600
you touch someone with an electrode on 
that strip,

255
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:44,000
they'll move the corresponding part of 
the body.

256
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,110
And the hands are very,
very overrepresented.

257
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:51,740
And so is the face and the lips and the 
tongue for obvious reasons.

258
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,640
We fiddle around with the world a lot.
We move our arms and our hands a lot,

259
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,670
the feeder overrepresented too.
And then we communicate about that with 

260
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,290
our face and our tongues.
So there's huge representation there.

261
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,770
Um,
so and if you touch that,

262
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:11,771
you'll get an emotion,
or at least the person will will 

263
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:15,880
describe a strong impulse to move well 
out of that grew the prefrontal cortex 

264
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:21,041
and the best way to think of people 
think about that as the substrate of 

265
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,310
abstract thought.

266
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,490
It's not really a good way of thinking 
about it because you're not really out 

267
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,661
to think you're out to act and the 
reason you think is so that you can try 

268
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:36,791
out some actions in a little world of 
fantasy before you implement them in 

269
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:38,300
your behavior.
Right?

270
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:43,301
So to think thing things through means 
to conjure up an abstracted world and 

271
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:48,491
then to conjure up a representation of 
yourself acting in that world to 

272
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:51,980
calculate the consequences and then to 
decide whether you're going to implement

273
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:52,220
it.
Well,

274
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:57,221
that's another form of dissociate 
ability because you can think without 

275
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:58,220
acting,
now you know,

276
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,490
it certainly that part of you that's 
able to conjure up the alternative 

277
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,300
worlds that human beings seem to 
particularly identify with.

278
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,320
You know that part that's thinking,
at least modern people really think of 

279
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,120
the part that's thinking as them or the 
part that's capable of abstract ideas,

280
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:19,390
and if it wasn't dissociable,
you'd just act out everything you 

281
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:19,390
thought,
well that wouldn't work very well,

282
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,380
so the brain is actually designed in 
many ways,

283
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,830
so to speak,
to be dissociable now.

284
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,790
So if you understand that and then you 
understand the two,

285
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,390
the two ela,
the two sets of phenomena that are 

286
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,021
likely to be dissociated,
then you kind of got the essence of 

287
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:42,431
Freudian theory and the things that are 
likely to be dissociated are one 

288
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:45,770
memories that were traumatic,
and I'll talk about that in a minute.

289
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,410
And two,
impulses,

290
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,910
they're not impulses,
they're not even drives,

291
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:52,830
which was the freud way of thinking 
about it.

292
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,340
They're subpersonalities troublesome 
subpersonalities,

293
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,880
and you can imagine that those would be 
linked to complex,

294
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,420
positive and negative emotions.
One might be resentment,

295
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,680
guilt,
shame,

296
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,750
anger,
anxiety,

297
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,480
jealousy,
rage,

298
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,210
lust.
All of those emotions are,

299
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,660
are difficult to integrate into a 
personality property,

300
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,960
partly because in their pure 
manifestation,

301
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,610
they're not there.
They disrupt the social order,

302
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,690
you know,
so like,

303
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,350
think about how well regulated all of 
you are sitting here,

304
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,580
you know,
and you think,

305
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:34,581
well,
you're 6 million years since you 

306
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,370
dissociated or since you've diverged 
from chimpanzees,

307
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:39,390
if we took a bunch of chimpanzees that 
knew each other as well as you know each

308
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:44,391
other,
this place would be an absolute brutal 

309
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:44,391
massacre.

310
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:45,140
So you know,
for,

311
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:50,141
for whatever reason,
you can control your primordial 

312
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:52,350
instincts.
That's one way of looking at it.

313
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,930
That's how Freud would look at it.
You've learned to control them.

314
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,620
And Freud's theory,
and this is where it differs from the 

315
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,340
theories that we talked about earlier,
say with regards to piaget,

316
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,250
Freud's theory is really more about 
control.

317
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,460
He thought of all of these potential 
subsystems and memories conflicting with

318
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,630
each other like a war,
like a hog Z in war.

319
00:19:15,631 --> 00:19:19,890
So hobbes was the philosopher who said 
that life is nasty,

320
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:21,000
brutal,
and short.

321
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,660
And that in the state of nature,
everyone is at war with everyone else.

322
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,590
And so you need a,
um,

323
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,270
a Leviathan,
a top down control system,

324
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:34,800
a Leviathan who will punish any deviance
from the social contract.

325
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,990
Well,
that's the Freudian Super Ego.

326
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,540
Now,
Freud thought of the unconscious and the

327
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:43,990
conscious mind to begin with,
but later he dissociated that up into in

328
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,780
ego and superego.

329
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,440
And then he thought that each of those 
had their unconscious elements.

330
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,780
So you know,
so you,

331
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,790
if you're under the grip of an ID 
related subpersonality,

332
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,470
let's say you could be conscious of 
that,

333
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:03,471
but there's the possibility for all 
sorts of other interrelated 

334
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:06,681
subpersonalities to emerge.
So those would be in your unconscious 

335
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,190
and it's also possible and highly likely
in fact,

336
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,790
that the way that you're perceiving the 
world and the way you're acting in it,

337
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,910
and even what you state as your goals 
are influenced in ways that you don't 

338
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,620
understand by the action of these 
unconscious system.

339
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,450
So for example,
you know,

340
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,550
maybe some of you are headed for medical
school.

341
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:28,551
And if I asked you why,
you will give me six humanitarian 

342
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:31,011
reasons.
But the actual reason is is because you 

343
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:34,031
know your grandmother would be 
disappointed if you weren't and she 

344
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:34,890
might not even be alive anymore,
you know,

345
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:39,891
she may have,
your mother may have imitated your 

346
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:42,351
grandmother so that that ideal is firmly
embodied in her and that set up the 

347
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,110
unspoken expectations about your 
behavior ever since you were a tiny 

348
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:48,110
child.

349
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,440
So now it's an interesting sub element 
of,

350
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,520
of psychodynamic theory too,
and it's really something to watch for 

351
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,260
in your personal relationships.
It's very,

352
00:20:56,261 --> 00:21:00,160
very frequently if you watch carefully 
that you can see someone,

353
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:05,161
especially someone you love because you 
have to know them well being taken over 

354
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:08,440
in some sense by the spirit of one of 
their ancestors.

355
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:11,320
And I don't mean this in a metaphysical 
way.

356
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,530
I mean that the,
the,

357
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,770
the thought,
the personality of the grandmother or 

358
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,611
the personality of the mother has a,
has a structure that's well known to 

359
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:27,961
the,
to the individual in question and that 

360
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:30,541
individual spent a lot of time imitating
them in all sorts of ways and those 

361
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:35,281
imitated structures.
Can it be passed down generation to 

362
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:35,281
generation?
I mean,

363
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:39,481
in fact,
that's partly what constitutes your 

364
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:39,481
culture,
right?

365
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:43,141
It's the imitated personality of all of 
your ancestors that constitutes your 

366
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,950
culture and those things can possess 
you.

367
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,670
Ideologies possess you and exact not 
exactly the same way,

368
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:51,430
but in a very similar way.
So,

369
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,820
okay,
so you've got the end and you've got the

370
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:57,970
ego and the Superego,
and as in the hot seat and worldview,

371
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,120
there's real tension between them so 
that the end is always trying to get 

372
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,900
it's based gratifications,
it's based desires,

373
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,920
gratifying.
Now in the infrared and times that was 

374
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,601
mostly problematic in relationship to 
sex and the reasons for that are quite 

375
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:18,520
clear.
There was no valid birth control.

376
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,460
There was very little employment option 
for women.

377
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,890
So there sexual behavior had to be very,
very,

378
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:31,891
very tightly regulated or they'd fall 
outside of the social structure into 

379
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:35,260
prostitution or something like that.
And then there was the threat of various

380
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:38,350
venereal diseases,
most particularly syphilis,

381
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:39,280
which is as awful,
uh,

382
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,300
diseases you can imagine if it could 
imitate or mimic all sorts of other 

383
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,440
diseases.

384
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,220
And it's transmissible from mother to 
child.

385
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,220
So it's a nasty one.
So sick,

386
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,600
it was very difficult for the victorians
to integrate sexuality because,

387
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,820
well,
exactly how did you do that?

388
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,110
They're the one pathway to potential 
integration.

389
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:06,010
Something the Super Ego say would 
approve of was American pathway,

390
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:09,940
but you know,
people back then back in the 19 sixties,

391
00:23:09,941 --> 00:23:12,760
people were getting married around 19 or
20,

392
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:14,770
but that's actually a historical 
anomaly.

393
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:18,040
I mean typically speaking in the 
Victorian age,

394
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,190
a man usually couldn't afford to get 
married until he was in his mid to late 

395
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,520
twenties.
He just didn't have the resources,

396
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:25,510
so women were married usually younger 
than that,

397
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,370
but so there was a long period of time 
for,

398
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,570
for men particularly,
but also for women where the sexual 

399
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,190
drive from a Freudian perspective was in
full,

400
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,180
was fully flourishing,
fully manifesting itself,

401
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:45,181
but there was no socially approved mode 
of expression and so under those 

402
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:49,250
conditions there's a war between the ID 
and the superego in a sense,

403
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:51,230
and Portland ego was crushed in the 
middle.

404
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,800
Now you could certainly see that when we
were watching the movie,

405
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:59,801
the crumb brothers movie,
because they are basically in the same 

406
00:23:59,801 --> 00:23:59,801
situation,
right?

407
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:03,430
There was no socially approved way that 
they could manifest any sexual or any 

408
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:08,111
aggressive behavior and what happened as
a consequence was that the both of those

409
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,550
fundamental subpersonalities,
let's call them,

410
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,730
become incredibly pathologized as 
particularly characterized by resentment

411
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,070
and the desire for revenge.
Because remember,

412
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:21,080
these systems think,
you know,

413
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,740
if someone's excrutiatingly sexually 
frustrated,

414
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:29,741
let's say,
and let's think about it in the broader 

415
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:30,170
scheme of things because sexuality isn't
really.

416
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,550
It's not a narrow unit.
Dimensional drive it,

417
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,330
you know it's associated with 
playfulness and it's associated with the

418
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:43,331
desire for social contact and the desire
for communication and the desire for 

419
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:45,890
touching like it's a complicated multi 
branching phenomenon.

420
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,820
Well in in the case of the people who 
were watching in the movie,

421
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,840
none of that was either integrate it 
into their personalities,

422
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:58,120
let's say,
or permitted by society and so it it.

423
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,420
It was bent and warped and and 
frustrated and then generated all sorts 

424
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,650
of ideas about resentment and revenge 
around it.

425
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,980
So you can develop an incredibly,
an incredibly pathological 

426
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,000
subpersonality.
In the one cartoon,

427
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:17,600
if you remember when it was the one that
was most disturbing,

428
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:21,830
where Mr Natural brought Robert that 
headless woman,

429
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:27,050
so he wanted pure gratification without 
responsibility,

430
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:32,051
so it's a really driven phenomena and so
he had intercourse with her and 

431
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:34,670
immediately asked her that was 
unbelievably guilty.

432
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,850
You know when you can see,
so you think about what that must mean.

433
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:41,720
It's like someone is under the grip of 
one subpersonalities.

434
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:46,770
It shaping all of their thoughts and 
their memories and their emotions and 

435
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,780
all of a sudden that becomes gratified 
so it's satiated.

436
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,650
It disappears in Bang up comes the other
one and it's you know,

437
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,510
wealth.
In this particular example,

438
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:57,830
it was guilt and shame and anxiety,
terror even and self loathing.

439
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,310
All of those things.
And if you read about the experiences of

440
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:04,100
people who commit particularly atrocious
crimes,

441
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:09,310
it's very,
very common for them to experience 

442
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,501
exactly that.
They are driven by sexual slash 

443
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:15,431
aggressive impulses because those are 
generally the ones that culminated in 

444
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:16,610
the particularly atrocious,
you know,

445
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,990
individual crimes and they'll commit 
them and then the instantly flipped back

446
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:25,991
into their normative personality.
Except they're absolutely terrified by 

447
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:29,381
what they did and you know it's more 
than one person is inhabiting the same 

448
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:33,260
psych and it's very.
Now they're tied together by memory.

449
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:38,261
Generally speaking.
Although Freud would say you can also 

450
00:26:38,261 --> 00:26:41,531
dissociate memory and so Freud talked,
talked about memories being repressed 

451
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,790
and that's caused an awful lot of 
trouble because,

452
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:51,110
well,
for a whole variety of reasons because 

453
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:56,410
because memory is not,
memory is not the object of recording.

454
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,760
It's not the objective unbiased 
recording of actually occurring events.

455
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,540
First of all,
because you can't actually objective 

456
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,210
where you record certain kinds of nets.
Like we talked about this before.

457
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:17,211
You can't really objective where you 
record a discussion between a man and a 

458
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:21,621
woman who'd been married for 20 years 
about anything important because for 

459
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:25,491
them,
each word and each phrase and each 

460
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:28,491
sentence and each facial expression has 
to be interpreted within the context of 

461
00:27:28,491 --> 00:27:33,171
the entire relationship.
In order for the meaning of the 

462
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:36,801
utterances to be extracted and there's 
just no way you can record that in the 

463
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:36,801
video.
You.

464
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:41,000
You'd have to have videoed the entire 
relationship and so you're not going to 

465
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,420
do that.
And so memory is a very,

466
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:47,421
very peculiar thing and the idea that 
you could have an objective restaurant 

467
00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:49,890
is not a very sophisticated idea 
anyways.

468
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,750
Freud's idea in some sense he had a 
somewhat,

469
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,730
I hate to say it was an inner 
sufficiently sophisticated notion of 

470
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,940
what memory was.

471
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,240
Now I hate to say that because Freud was
a very sophisticated person,

472
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,690
but he did in some sense believe in the 
existence of an objective interpersonal 

473
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,491
world.
And so he thought if something terrible 

474
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:18,030
happened to you when you were a child,
that you had a record of the memory.

475
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,240
It was there as the memory as the event 
and then you needed something that would

476
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,160
like a sensor that would repress that 
and then you needed a place for it to be

477
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:31,440
repressed into which would be the 
unconscious.

478
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,250
But if you.
But if you take a part,

479
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:38,640
a traumatic memory,
generally speaking with someone,

480
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:43,641
I heard that he also.
He also thought that that repressed 

481
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:47,091
memory might be represented in a,
in a symptom,

482
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,390
a symbolic symptom.
So I think,

483
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,340
I think that the repression theory

484
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,300
suffers from the inadequacy of its 
representation of memory because he,

485
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,740
here's a different way of thinking about
it.

486
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,490
It's more in keeping with the layer 
model,

487
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,920
the hierarchical layer model that we've 
been entertaining as we progress.

488
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,540
So imagine that your,
um,

489
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,880
molested by your uncle because it's 
usually a family member when you're for 

490
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,780
sexually molested.
Okay?

491
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,200
The first thing you have to ask yourself
is just exactly what kind of memory do 

492
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,221
you have.
Imagine you're completely sexually 

493
00:29:27,221 --> 00:29:29,681
naive,
which basically means you know nothing 

494
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:30,130
about the sexual act and,
and it's,

495
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,230
and it's implications or the mechanics.
But this happens to you.

496
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:36,680
So the first question is how do you 
represent that?

497
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,750
And that sir,
is because to rip,

498
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:40,700
to remember something,
you have to represent it.

499
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,760
That's,
that's the thing is you don't just have 

500
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,091
a memory of that event.
It's always interpretation because 

501
00:29:48,091 --> 00:29:48,550
there's so many things going on.

502
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,830
Well,
so maybe you,

503
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,980
maybe your representation is pain and 
confusion,

504
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,220
something like that.
And then there'd be another layer over 

505
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,680
that which would be the necessity for 
secrecy because of course the person who

506
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:04,900
does the molesting is going to tell you,
well,

507
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:06,700
one of two things,
three,

508
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:09,310
maybe it's good for you,
you asked for it,

509
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,780
don't tell anyone or or they'll think 
you're a bad person.

510
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,150
This will be our little secret.
Something like that.

511
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,270
So then there's that whole overlay of 
secrecy and inadmissibility and what are

512
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:27,841
you supposed to do about that?
When you're for how are you supposed to 

513
00:30:27,841 --> 00:30:28,210
understand that something has just 
transpired,

514
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:30,040
that you're not allowed to share with 
anyone.

515
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:35,550
You don't have a model of the world 
that's sophisticated enough to account 

516
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:35,620
for all that.
And so then

517
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,810
perhaps from then on,
what you do is avoid thinking about it.

518
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,910
Now.
That's not the same as repression.

519
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:48,090
Avoiding thinking about something is not
the same as repression because it 

520
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,840
doesn't require an active repressor in 
order to do it.

521
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:55,110
And then maybe you know,
years later you start to recall what 

522
00:30:56,441 --> 00:31:01,441
happened,
but what you recall is an unclear mess 

523
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:04,150
and the read and maybe most of it 
because you might say,

524
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:09,151
well,
how are things represented as memories 

525
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:11,290
when you can't develop a sophisticated 
representation and what seems to happen?

526
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:16,291
And this is in a sense,
the reason reversive Freudian theory is 

527
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:16,291
that

528
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,470
the,
the

529
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,520
event is represented in the body.
And so you can think about the 

530
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:28,960
representation of advantage as a 
multilayered neurological phenomenon.

531
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,860
And so if you encounter something that's
unexpected or frightening,

532
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:37,861
the first thing that happens is very,
very ancient reflex of systems act 

533
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:39,520
first.
And those things are fast.

534
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,680
And so that's the sort of thing that,
for example,

535
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:44,050
might protect you against the snake 
bite.

536
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:46,330
If a snake jumped out at you,
we're going to jump backwards.

537
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:51,331
And believe me,
you do that before you even see the 

538
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:53,881
snake because it takes you a quarter to 
second to produce complex visual 

539
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:58,891
representation of the snake.
And if you wait around for recorder for 

540
00:31:58,891 --> 00:31:58,940
a second,
then you're dead.

541
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,140
And so what's happened is that your 
nervous system has conserved basic 

542
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,820
reflexes that are only a few synapses 
long,

543
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:10,420
so maybe those work between your retina 
and your spinal cord,

544
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,720
your retina,
and maybe a very primordial emotional 

545
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,541
system like the Amygdala is wired up to 
detect things like snakes and it just 

546
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:22,981
sends a message down to your spinal cord
or or slightly more sophisticated motor 

547
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:27,871
control systems that says,
jump backwards now and then maybe you 

548
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:31,501
think about it isn't even till after 
that that your heart rate goes up and 

549
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:35,401
your blood pressure goes up and you 
start to breathe heavily and then 

550
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:38,761
there's a wave of fear and revulsion,
which is perhaps there to teach you not 

551
00:32:38,761 --> 00:32:40,040
to do such a stupid thing again.

552
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,490
You know,
we don't exactly know why you would 

553
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:45,490
experience negative emotion,
you know,

554
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,180
or what function the negative emotion 
has,

555
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,420
except that we do know that a pattern of
neurological behavior that's followed by

556
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:57,521
a punishment or a threat is likely less 
likely to be reimplemented in the 

557
00:32:58,761 --> 00:32:59,810
future.
Okay.

558
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:04,811
So the reaction to the anomalous thing 
is broadly and then maybe it's emotion 

559
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,230
and then maybe it's image,
like imagination,

560
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:14,231
you know,
what just happened and then maybe it's 

561
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:16,331
articulated speech,
but lots of things don't get past image 

562
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:19,910
to articulating speech and some things I
think don't even get past body.

563
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,690
Sorry about that.

564
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,460
So I don't think that these traumatic 
memories are so much repressed as Freud 

565
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,111
had it,
as never brought forward for 

566
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:39,111
development.
So,

567
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:39,870
um,
let me,

568
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,970
I'll tell you a story about how this 
might work.

569
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:43,740
Okay.
So one time I had this client,

570
00:33:43,741 --> 00:33:45,810
she was about 27.
I only saw her once,

571
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:50,610
this is when I was training to be a 
psychotherapist and she came into me and

572
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:55,611
she said that she had been plagued by 
these thoughts of being sexually abused 

573
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:59,160
when she was a child.
And I said,

574
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:01,470
well,
who was doing this to you?

575
00:34:01,471 --> 00:34:02,340
And she said,
well,

576
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:03,740
it was my brother.
And I said,

577
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,020
she said he was a lot older than me.
And so I formulated this medical model 

578
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:10,210
of her being,
you know,

579
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:15,290
somewhere between 10 and 13 and her 
brother being somewhere between say 15 

580
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,370
and 20,
because the way she described it was,

581
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,160
you know,
that she was overpowered by a larger,

582
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,290
a physically larger male.

583
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,620
So we talked for awhile and then she 
finally told me,

584
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:25,980
I said,
well,

585
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,020
how old were you when this happened?
And she said,

586
00:34:28,021 --> 00:34:30,090
well,
I was for okay.

587
00:34:30,091 --> 00:34:30,990
And now.
And then I said,

588
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:31,470
well,
okay,

589
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:34,020
how old was your brother?
And she said,

590
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:35,340
well,
he was six.

591
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,500
And so I said,
well look,

592
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:39,960
you know,
here's one way of looking at it,

593
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,140
like you're looking at it from the 
perspective of the four year old.

594
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,260
It's a regression in some sense.
That's still how old you are as far as 

595
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,600
experiencing the memory.
Here's an alternative hypothesis.

596
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:57,590
Your brother wasn't a predator.
You were both terribly supervise 

597
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,430
children.
Well,

598
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,780
you know,
that made the lights go on in your inner

599
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,730
mind because she'd never thought about 
it that way.

600
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,670
Like she'd never taken that 
representation,

601
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:12,780
which would be her emotional experience 
as a four year old related to a six year

602
00:35:12,781 --> 00:35:12,900
old.

603
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,770
Six year old is a lot bigger and more 
powerful than four-year-olds.

604
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,550
Right?
It's is,

605
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,700
it's,
you know,

606
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,960
50 percent owner.
So it's a big deal when you're four.

607
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,560
But if the,
if the issue for the memory is its 

608
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,150
relevance to current conceptualization 
and behavior,

609
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,350
it was much better for her to update the
memory in a sense and think,

610
00:35:34,351 --> 00:35:39,351
well yeah,
like a six year olds this and like the 

611
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:41,700
Oreos this high and like what the hell 
were my parents doing anyways?

612
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,210
And that's an entirely different story 
than,

613
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,010
than the one that she had come up with 
kid come in with,

614
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,040
you know.
And that seemed to be a great relief to 

615
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,040
her.
And that's partly because you know,

616
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,910
if you're bothered by a traumatic 
memory,

617
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:58,911
it keeps resurfacing on which it will.
And it's actually one of the ways of 

618
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:01,710
identifying a traumatic memory is that 
the thing won't leave you alone.

619
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,450
It keeps coming up and dreams.
And when your mind is wandering,

620
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,460
it'll keep coming up.
When your mind is wandering and maybe 

621
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,520
it'll come up when you're going to sleep
at night and like it invades your mind.

622
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,360
There's a reason for that and the reason
is is that the underlying emotional 

623
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,380
systems that are associated with 
anxiety,

624
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:24,530
so those are mostly hippocampus and then
maybe a lot of dual duo in some sense 

625
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:29,631
that are mediating those there an alarm 
system and the alarm is something that's

626
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:35,601
potentially dangerous has happened.
You need to figure out what it means so 

627
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:36,630
that you can stop that from happening in
the future.

628
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,160
Okay,
so you need a plan.

629
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:43,190
You need and get applied and you do have
to do a causal analysis of the 

630
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,840
relationship between your behavior and 
the traumatic outcome.

631
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,530
That would be the first thing and then 
you have to come up with a way that that

632
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:50,580
won't happen again.

633
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,390
And of course for my client,
that happened pretty much right away 

634
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,620
because now she was a 27 year old woman 
in the probability that she was going to

635
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:02,790
be subject in any serious way to a 
situation.

636
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,210
The same as the one she was remembering 
was zero.

637
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,780
But,
and I've seen this in other clients too,

638
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:11,190
is when they're,
when they're,

639
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,570
when,
okay.

640
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:15,150
I had another client who,
who,

641
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,950
uh,
when she was,

642
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,920
I think I told you about her briefly 
when she was young,

643
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:24,921
four years old,
she jumped in a shopping cart and went 

644
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:28,760
down a hill,
like a paved hail in the shopping cart 

645
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,411
and spilled out at the bottom and hurt 
herself and they took her to the 

646
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:31,411
hospital and,
you know,

647
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:33,780
so then she's all primed for being 
threatened and men.

648
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,520
So that's kind of means you're open to 
rewire reading some sense in this.

649
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,520
So then when she's in the hospital,
they don't let her parents come and see 

650
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:42,520
her for a couple of weeks,
you know,

651
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,091
so the trauma,
the pain and the anxiety and the threat 

652
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:48,030
than the ambulance ride and all those 
things,

653
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:50,460
which sort of puts her in a state like 
this,

654
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,060
which might be a,
like a,

655
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,740
a state that's particular to conducive 
to learning.

656
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,340
If something traumatic is happening,
you should be learning about that.

657
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,230
What the world's like around that right 
now.

658
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,890
And uh,
she developed at a permanent trauma 

659
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,140
related paranoia about institutions 
which turned by the time I met her,

660
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:14,280
had turned into a whole philosophy of 
institutional oppression,

661
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,000
but it's core was that Tara,
and rightly so,

662
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:23,090
it's core was that combination of 
physiological trauma and psychological 

663
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,741
trauma and you know,
miss handling of the situation by people

664
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:29,890
in authority.
So,

665
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:36,060
so you can see under those circumstances
how a traumatic memory can become the 

666
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,300
core of a whole large subpersonality.

667
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,760
Now it has to be taken apart very 
carefully,

668
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:45,090
especially if that subpersonality isn't 
the kind that can be easily integrated 

669
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,360
into the world.
So for example,

670
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:48,940
if you're paranoid about all 
institutions,

671
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:54,060
you're in real trouble because in a 
modern world you're faced with the 

672
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,240
necessity of dealing with institutions 
all the time.

673
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:59,680
And if you're more distrustful and 
paranoid about them,

674
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,680
then you couldn't be.
If you were sophisticated,

675
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:05,470
all of it's going to happen is they're 
going to continually mistreat you,

676
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,400
right?
Because I mean,

677
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:11,401
if a dog comes up to you and it's,
it's looking suspiciously and barking 

678
00:39:11,401 --> 00:39:12,100
and growling,
you're not going to pet it.

679
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,730
You know,
the way you interact with the system is 

680
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,390
depends the,
the reaction of a system to you is 

681
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,080
dependent to a large degree on how you 
approach the system.

682
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,270
So anyways,
the dissociate ability ideas,

683
00:39:26,271 --> 00:39:27,100
they're really good one.

684
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,880
I mean

685
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,420
if you want to get to know yourself 
better,

686
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,480
and this is sort of a combination of 
Friday and in union ideas,

687
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:40,870
one of the things to do is to.
So imagine that you have some sort of 

688
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,290
goal in mind.
The first question is you that you might

689
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:45,470
ask yourself is why do you have that 
goal?

690
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,950
What are the influences on you that have
set that goal up?

691
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:53,951
Because it easily could be conscious or 
partially conscious or poorly explained 

692
00:39:55,131 --> 00:40:00,131
or implicit any of those things.
So you want to know that why are you 

693
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:00,440
doing what you're doing?

694
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,500
And the second thing is if you find 
yourself avoiding things on the way to 

695
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:12,571
that goal,
the next question is why are you 

696
00:40:12,571 --> 00:40:12,700
avoiding them?
And you know,

697
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:16,360
that'll mean delving into parts of 
yourself that are quite hidden and quite

698
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:17,860
uncomfortable.
So for example,

699
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,280
if you discover that the reason you're 
pursuing a particular goal is because 

700
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,780
it's what your parents want you to do,
one question that immediately arises,

701
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,110
rises is,
yeah,

702
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:34,111
but is that what you want to do?
And you know that that's a very 

703
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:38,980
complicated question because you'd have 
to dissociate the part of you that's the

704
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:43,981
you that doesn't want to do it from the 
part of you that's the you that does 

705
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:47,821
want to do it,
and then you have to figure out why in 

706
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,611
the world you'd be avoiding.
So you know it might be that you're an 

707
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:53,490
unbelievably angry that you've been 
tilted towards this particular goal for 

708
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:59,131
reasons that have nothing to do with 
your choice and so that every time you 

709
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:03,631
have the opportunity to study or,
or accomplish something that would move 

710
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:06,910
you farther to that goal,
you're either not motivated.

711
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:09,040
So you can't pay attention.
You can't study,

712
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:14,041
you can't learn and you procrastinate 
all the time or you actually do 

713
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:15,970
seriously counterproductive thing.
So people,

714
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,950
for example,
people can be.

715
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,460
I just had someone write me here a while
ago because he was watching the youtube 

716
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,990
lectures and he said that he had dreams 
for six weeks,

717
00:41:27,991 --> 00:41:31,170
that he drove his car off a cliff and 
crashed it,

718
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,800
and then at the end of the series he 
drove his car off the cliff and crashed 

719
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,090
it and he asked me what that meant,
and I said,

720
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:43,091
well,
the dream is telling you that you're 

721
00:41:43,091 --> 00:41:45,191
being far too careless with your life.
Like maybe that's what driving a cliff 

722
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:48,680
off a car off a cliff repeatedly needs.
It's like you know,

723
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:52,190
that's a good descent unconscious 
descent into the underworld.

724
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,410
Well,
and he was being warned.

725
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,920
The psychological reality was such that

726
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,720
the warning was extremely serious and so
was the danger.

727
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,780
So then you might say,
well,

728
00:42:03,781 --> 00:42:06,150
why would he drive himself off a cliff?
Well,

729
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,370
you know,
that's a suicidal gesture.

730
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:09,240
And then you might ask,
well,

731
00:42:09,241 --> 00:42:11,640
why would somebody be suicidal?
And that could be,

732
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,880
well,
they're out for revenge against their 

733
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:16,880
parents or they're out for revenge 
against the whole world or the route for

734
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,711
revenge against themselves.
Or they just want to make their painful 

735
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:24,951
consciousness go away,
or they're living a messy and pointless 

736
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:28,970
and painful life and and they want to 
punish themselves for it and you know 

737
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,780
it's very,
very complicated and tangled down there 

738
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,991
at the bottom of things and people don't
really like to look into it and I 

739
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:39,651
suppose to some degree that's the shadow
element because what you find there is 

740
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:44,541
seldom what you want in one of the prime
dictums of union psychotherapy and most 

741
00:42:46,771 --> 00:42:51,771
psychotherapies are predicated on the 
idea that you should find out what 

742
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:53,520
you're avoiding and then you should 
figure out how to voluntarily face it.

743
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:58,730
Now you might add to that you should 
find out what you're doing and why and 

744
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,171
see if that's actually what you want to 
be doing and if those reasons are 

745
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:04,800
reasons you like that might,
you know,

746
00:43:04,801 --> 00:43:07,530
in some sense some up therapy in a 
couple of phrases,

747
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:08,370
but

748
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,520
in order to manage that,
then you have to look at all the things 

749
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:15,520
you've been avoiding.
Well,

750
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,370
what do you avoid?
Well,

751
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:18,440
it isn't rainbows and cookies,
right?

752
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:22,550
The things that you avoid are the things
that no one wants to look at,

753
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:27,551
and so your primary dictum for his 
psychotherapeutic practice was a Latin 

754
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:30,890
phrase which is in sterk wiliness 
infinite tour,

755
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,040
which I'm probably pronouncing wrong,
which means either in filth it will be 

756
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,661
found or where are you want most is to 
be found where you least want to look.

757
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,860
You know when those are.
That's what that.

758
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,060
That's a horrible philosophy,
but you can see that it's almost self.

759
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,070
It's almost self fulfilling because of 
course the things you're going to avoid.

760
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:53,750
Are there things that you don't want to 
face?

761
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Obviously now the shadow element of the 
psyche in some sense when you were 

762
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:04,691
watching the movie for example,
you saw these drives mostly sexual and 

763
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:09,971
aggressive that were manifesting 
themselves in all sorts of ways and so 

764
00:44:09,971 --> 00:44:12,140
that would be maybe the repressed or 
unincorporated elements of the Ed,

765
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,320
but then there was a side of.
There was another more complex side of 

766
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,060
that where the,
the,

767
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,070
the,
the people were reacting to that,

768
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:27,071
you know,
because they felt downtrodden and 

769
00:44:27,071 --> 00:44:29,110
oppressed and and antisocial and 
critical of social structure.

770
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:34,301
And all of that,
because they were unable to manifest 

771
00:44:34,301 --> 00:44:38,271
themselves properly in the world and 
that produced fantasies of extreme 

772
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:40,260
destruction,
exceptional destruction for them.

773
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:45,261
They were mostly sexually related,
but for other people that can manifest 

774
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:49,431
itself in incredibly violent fantasies 
about the destruction of society as 

775
00:44:49,431 --> 00:44:49,740
such.

776
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,100
So

777
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,040
if you can invite all the parts of you 
out to play,

778
00:44:55,041 --> 00:45:00,041
the parts that get left behind are not 
very happy about it and they don't just 

779
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:01,040
sit around having a tea party,
you know,

780
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:02,410
they turn into,
they turn it into,

781
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:06,680
especially as you mature,
they turn into these worked monsters and

782
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,740
their,
their mode of action in the world is 

783
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,950
anything but positive.
And the Freudian world and the world of 

784
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:21,641
the psychoanalytic unconscious is quite 
a terrifying place because it makes you 

785
00:45:21,741 --> 00:45:25,220
second guess everything.
It's like it's not a paranoia out.

786
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:25,680
Okay.

787
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,030
You never.
It's very,

788
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:35,031
very difficult.
Once you're trained psychoanalytically 

789
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:38,241
to ever assume that someone's benevolent
motivations are only what they claim 

790
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:44,481
they are,
you're always looking for the other 

791
00:45:44,481 --> 00:45:44,481
missing piece.
And,

792
00:45:44,481 --> 00:45:45,870
and I think it's extremely useful 
because,

793
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:50,871
you know,
you run into people particularity 

794
00:45:50,871 --> 00:45:51,750
ideologues who will claim that they're 
acting on the world's behalf.

795
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,480
It's like,
yeah,

796
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,900
who made us sane and why should I 
believe that all the good is on your 

797
00:45:59,900 --> 00:45:59,900
side.
Like,

798
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,590
what is it that you're not talking 
about?

799
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:04,650
What it is that,
what is it that you're not revealing?

800
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,320
I got something from Greenpeace once,
for example,

801
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:12,321
that was asking for donations and the 
brochure was just photographs of all the

802
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,610
people who were on the board.
I thought,

803
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:22,660
why do I want to see photographs of all 
the people who are on the board of 

804
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,171
Greenpeace,
or the other question is why do they 

805
00:46:26,171 --> 00:46:26,171
want to show them?
Well,

806
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,460
you don't have to faint very hard to 
figure that out.

807
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,560
You know,
it's a status maneuver,

808
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,470
what you'd expected to mail out like 
that as you know,

809
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:38,471
here's six things that we've done in the
last year that improve the planet and 

810
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:42,790
you know,
here's what we spent in relationship to 

811
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,630
administrative costs and here's why it 
was a good idea or not,

812
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,770
here's our leaders.
Now there's something wrong there.

813
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,810
And I mean that's,
I picked Greenpeace because it just 

814
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,051
happened to pop in money,
but it's the case for all sorts of of 

815
00:46:56,051 --> 00:46:56,051
organizations.

816
00:46:56,051 --> 00:46:59,620
So all right,
so

817
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,950
freud by 1900 had identified a lot of 
different functions of the unconscious 

818
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,110
and so here's four of them.
One was the unconscious,

819
00:47:08,111 --> 00:47:13,111
how to conservative function,
which meant that it stored memories 

820
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:16,920
often unaccessible to voluntary recall.
Now we don't really know how memories 

821
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,100
are stored in the brain,
but here's,

822
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,510
here's a guess.
So when you have an experience,

823
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:27,540
imagine that that produces a pattern of 
neural activity.

824
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,860
It's not just neuro,
but a pattern of activity in your brain 

825
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,841
and in your body,
at least part of how you remember it is 

826
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:43,651
to reactivate that pattern,
but it's not that simple obviously 

827
00:47:43,651 --> 00:47:47,221
because otherwise you docked out all 
your memories precisely and we don't 

828
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:48,940
know exactly how that initial

829
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,170
pattern of experienced gets edited down 
to the thing you remember.

830
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:59,171
But we do know that it,
it gets edited down in some ways as a 

831
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:02,000
consequence of its relevance to your 
current goal structure.

832
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,680
How that happens,
it seems computationally impossible.

833
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:08,900
We really don't understand how it 
happens at all.

834
00:48:08,901 --> 00:48:13,250
We don't understand how you can compute 
what's relevant and what isn't.

835
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:17,540
It seems that the world is too complex 
for that to even be possible.

836
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:23,260
So Conservative dissoluted the 
unconscious contains habits once 

837
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,600
voluntary,
now automatized and dissociated elements

838
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:29,630
of the personality which may lead a 
parasitic existence.

839
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:35,020
That's so I talked to a little bit about
traumatic memories and how they might 

840
00:48:35,271 --> 00:48:37,720
form the node of the development of a 
subpersonality,

841
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,610
but there's something else that's worth 
understanding too.

842
00:48:40,611 --> 00:48:45,611
So let's say you.
You start practicing a new minor mode of

843
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:50,270
being a new attitude or a new 
personality attribute or new habit.

844
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,430
Let's say it can be a fairly small 
thing.

845
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,940
When you first start practicing it,
you're not very good at it.

846
00:48:55,970 --> 00:49:00,970
For those of you who are musicians,
you know when you first start to play a 

847
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:04,271
piece,
you're very inefficient at it and then 

848
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:04,740
the more you practice it,
the more efficient you get it.

849
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,100
It's quite weird.
I'm not a very good pianist,

850
00:49:07,101 --> 00:49:09,200
but I learned to play one really 
difficult song,

851
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,500
but the terrible thing is is I'll learn 
to play it and then at some point I'll 

852
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,981
realize that I don't know the notes 
anymore and as soon as I realized I 

853
00:49:17,981 --> 00:49:18,890
don't know the notes,
I can't use those habit patterns anymore

854
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,510
and then I have to figure out the notes 
again.

855
00:49:20,511 --> 00:49:21,680
It's very,
very annoying,

856
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:27,070
but anyways,
when you first start practicing 

857
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:27,070
something,
it's effortful.

858
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:30,020
It requires a lot of brain activation.
That's what the scanning studies show,

859
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:35,021
but as you practice it more and more,
the amount of the brain that you use 

860
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:35,450
starts to shrink.

861
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:40,530
It generally moves left because the 
right hemisphere is more involved in 

862
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:44,201
novelty processing.
It generally moves left and then it 

863
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:47,051
moves back and the area gets smaller and
smaller and smaller until you generate 

864
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,930
it up a little machine or it's a little 
hard wired.

865
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:53,960
Some personality that takes care of that
particular operation.

866
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Now that's where thinking about too,
because what that means in some senses 

867
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,071
that your brain is full of the things 
that you've practiced and that's not 

868
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:07,430
exactly psychological right?
It's psychophysiological,

869
00:50:07,431 --> 00:50:10,430
it's part of your psyche,
but it's also hardwired into your brain.

870
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,410
If you want to overcome one of those 
habits,

871
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:14,840
you have to build a new machine that 
shuts it off.

872
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,750
You can't just get rid of it and then 
what happens?

873
00:50:17,751 --> 00:50:20,090
If you get stressed?
Often that new machine will get,

874
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:27,120
I don't know exactly how it happens.
The stress will reduce the functioning,

875
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,360
the new machine and old habit to pop 
back up.

876
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:34,540
Some of you will have noticed this.
How many of you have moved away from 

877
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,900
home?
Okay,

878
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:40,790
so how many of you know this?
When you go to your family of origin,

879
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:45,820
origin,
that all sorts of personality traits 

880
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,740
that you thought you abandoned 
immediately come flooding back.

881
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,870
So are you,
you know that,

882
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:52,250
you know that sensation,
right?

883
00:50:52,251 --> 00:50:57,251
You go back there and it's like bang,
there's a groove and you're right in it 

884
00:50:57,251 --> 00:51:00,221
and you know,
maybe you're as mature as a 30 year old 

885
00:51:00,221 --> 00:51:03,521
when you're at your own house,
but as soon as you come home it's like 

886
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:03,521
poof,
you're 14 again.

887
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:07,630
And it's partly because that's the 
expectancy situation set up by your 

888
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:11,111
parents,
but it's also partly because you just 

889
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:13,691
don't understand how much of your 
behavior is automatic and cued by 

890
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,010
ongoing you best.
It's habitual.

891
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,400
And so those you might think of those as
somewhat dissociated elements of the 

892
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,120
personality as well.
Creative.

893
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:27,680
The unconscious serves as the Matrix of 
new ideas.

894
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,090
So that's a more union idea and the way 
that seems to work,

895
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:39,170
you might think,
how in the world can you come up with a 

896
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:39,170
new idea?
It doesn't make sense,

897
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:39,450
right?
I mean,

898
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,600
what are you conjuring something out of?
Nothing.

899
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,090
Well,
you could say,

900
00:51:45,091 --> 00:51:47,340
well they're combinations of old ideas,
but you know,

901
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,370
that's not that helpful because you 
can't just take a bunch of old ideas and

902
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:53,820
shuffled them and come up with some new 
spectacular ideas.

903
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:58,680
It's a lot more complicated than that.
So here's one way to think about

904
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,140
forward,
investigated in some sense,

905
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:07,430
the surface of the creative unconscious.
And he was more concerned about the.

906
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:11,780
He don't call Freud's unconscious,
the personal unconscious.

907
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:16,990
So that might be the unconscious that 
you have that's related specifically to 

908
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:19,040
your experiences,
conscious and unconscious,

909
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:21,380
like it can be deep.
You have a dream once,

910
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:26,381
for example,
hope I've got this right that Freud and 

911
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:31,151
him were excavating the basement of a 
structure and that and then he broke 

912
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:36,161
through and found another huge structure
underneath that and that's just about 

913
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:39,821
exactly right.
And so there's the personal unconscious 

914
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:43,391
and then underneath that,
in theory there's what you called the 

915
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,380
collective unconscious and that would be
God only knows what that is,

916
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:50,381
but in part what it would be is whatever
it is that makes you human from an 

917
00:52:50,381 --> 00:52:55,361
evolutionary perspective and we don't 
know like you have a specific mode of 

918
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:57,590
being that's a human mode of big.

919
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:03,010
I think it was Eo Wilson who's a great 
entomologist and also the originator of 

920
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,320
sociobiology,
which is like a branch of evolutionary 

921
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,471
psychology.
He studied dance forever and social 

922
00:53:14,471 --> 00:53:18,671
behavior of ants and he's sad if,
if we can talk to and we wouldn't have 

923
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:25,391
anything to say to them.
And what he meant by that is that like 

924
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,650
interested in a bunch of things that you
just don't care about at all.

925
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,230
Like they're not jealous.
They don't get jealous,

926
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,440
they don't fall in love,
they don't have sexual feelings or 

927
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,090
behaviors.
They're not a cognitive creature.

928
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:44,150
It's like,
what the hell are you going to talk 

929
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:44,150
through now?
It's about how it's,

930
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:44,160
how is it going and carrying that grain 
of sand.

931
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:46,710
It's like an aunt as an impact,
doesn't even care about that.

932
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:52,050
And so it's interesting.
It's really a profound observation 

933
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:55,551
because what it indicates is that you 
couldn't even communicate with someone 

934
00:53:55,551 --> 00:53:58,590
unless you were 99 percent the same as 
they are.

935
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:03,630
Because to communicate with someone 
means you have to share a whole massive,

936
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,480
immense set of presuppositions.
So for example,

937
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:11,810
if I say I got jealous at a party last 
week,

938
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,840
it's like,
you're not going to say,

939
00:54:15,841 --> 00:54:18,720
what do you mean jealous?
That isn't going to be your question.

940
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,560
You're gonna say,
well,

941
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:23,760
what were their particular circumstances
that elicited that response?

942
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,840
I don't have to explain anger.
I don't have to explain playfulness,

943
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:28,830
hunger.
Oh,

944
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,080
you know,
all the basic human motivations that you

945
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:36,081
see displayed,
say in the typical adventure movie or 

946
00:54:36,081 --> 00:54:38,601
romantic comedy,
it's like those don't need explanation 

947
00:54:38,601 --> 00:54:41,721
because we're the same and it's that 
sameness that constitutes the essence of

948
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:48,141
the collective unconscious.
Now yeomans hypothesis was that you're 

949
00:54:48,141 --> 00:54:52,551
not only biologically structured,
you know in terms of your morphology of 

950
00:54:53,671 --> 00:54:56,160
your physiology,
but that that extends right up into your

951
00:54:56,161 --> 00:54:59,370
brain structure and even above that,
into the contents.

952
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:04,370
Either the contents of your psyche or at
least into the way that your psyche 

953
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:07,680
becomes organized across time and you 
know,

954
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:13,070
it seems.
It seems like a hypothesis that's so 

955
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:16,041
bloody obvious that you can't believe 
that people would have disputed it for 

956
00:55:16,041 --> 00:55:17,700
so long,
but experimental psychologists were very

957
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:22,701
strongly influenced by behaviorists and 
the behaviorist assumed partly through 

958
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,440
the illogical reasons and partly for the
sake of scientific simplicity that human

959
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,600
beings were blank slates and that all we
were was what we learned.

960
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,500
Well,
there's a book out now called human 

961
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,560
universals.
I'm unfortunately,

962
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:42,600
I can't remember the name of the author 
right now,

963
00:55:42,601 --> 00:55:47,601
but it's a book.
It's a work of sociology slash 

964
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:50,330
anthropology and this person has 
collected human commonality,

965
00:55:50,331 --> 00:55:52,950
so what's.
What's the same about people everywhere?

966
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:57,951
Well,
we pretty much all were close sometimes 

967
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,830
for protective purposes,
but if not generally,

968
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:02,820
at least for ceremonial purposes,
there's pair bonding in societies.

969
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:05,670
People Fall in love.
The basic emotions are the same.

970
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:08,610
We use fire.
That's a big deal,

971
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,040
you know,
because no other animal can manage that.

972
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:16,041
There's.
There's literally dozens and dozens of 

973
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:18,950
universal commonalities across people 
and that's part of the substructure of 

974
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,390
the collective unconscious.
So anyways,

975
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:25,240
back to the creative idea.
Well,

976
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,900
partly your creative act is going to be 
a consequence of your attempts to 

977
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,341
integrate the peculiarities of your own 
experience with the peculiarities of 

978
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:40,000
your culture and this and that more 
general

979
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,310
phenomenon states of being that you 
share with other people.

980
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:50,050
So because you come into the world and 
have your own viewpoint,

981
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:55,380
you're you have access to information 
that no other person has access to and 

982
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,600
so to some degree that can be the basis 
of your creativity.

983
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:02,200
Just that information,
but then in order to communicate it,

984
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,110
which is also part of being creative,
right?

985
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:08,540
Because you can't just be creative,
but no one can understand you.

986
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,320
It's more like you're schizophrenic than
like your creative,

987
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:16,321
right?
You have loose associations and so 

988
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:18,571
forth,
but you cannot put together a coherent 

989
00:57:18,571 --> 00:57:20,431
story,
so then you have to take that unique 

990
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:21,400
information and integrate it with your 
cultural knowledge,

991
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:25,180
your cultural narratives,
and grounded in universal human biology,

992
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:27,550
and then you can present that as a 
creative act.

993
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:28,610
Now

994
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:34,710
that's one possible place for the origin
of new ideas,

995
00:57:34,711 --> 00:57:35,700
but here's another.

996
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,260
So

997
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,420
remember we talked about piaget.
Piaget basically said that to begin to 

998
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,840
understand something,
you acted out so you represent the world

999
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,300
with your body,
by sitting on a chair.

1000
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:52,730
You represent the chair with your body,
by walking through a doorway.

1001
00:57:52,731 --> 00:57:54,530
You represent the doorway with your 
body.

1002
00:57:54,531 --> 00:57:57,320
By grabbing that glass,
you do the same thing,

1003
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,590
so you're matching.
You're imitating the world all the time,

1004
00:58:00,591 --> 00:58:03,290
so you're mapping it onto your 
physiological structure.

1005
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,930
So okay,
so that you get a sense.

1006
00:58:05,931 --> 00:58:08,900
That would be.
That's kind of what understanding means.

1007
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:14,390
You know,
because that's a complex term to sort 

1008
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,301
of,
to understand what does it mean to 

1009
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:18,041
understand something means to get a grip
on it and we use those terms for a 

1010
00:58:18,471 --> 00:58:19,910
reason.
It's to be,

1011
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:25,030
you know,
you're standing firmly in relationship 

1012
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:25,880
to it.
You can handle it all of those things.

1013
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:27,440
So that's one.

1014
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:33,790
So that's the beginning.
But then also you're capable of 

1015
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:36,281
imitating so you can imitate yourself,
which is what you do when you repeat 

1016
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:39,890
experiences that had a positive outcome,
but you can also imitate other people.

1017
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:41,390
Then you think,
okay,

1018
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:44,210
well who are those people imitating?
Well,

1019
00:58:44,211 --> 00:58:49,211
the answer to that is it's like we're 
led screens and we're constantly 

1020
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:55,280
revealing imitations of imitations,
of invitations,

1021
00:58:55,281 --> 00:59:00,140
of invitations across our physiological 
landscape.

1022
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:04,700
I mean you guys are the sum total of a 
very long evolutionary process,

1023
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:09,530
but you're also the sum total of an 
incredibly long process of mimicry.

1024
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:14,300
And so what you mimic is your culture,
so you can think of your culture.

1025
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:19,301
It's something with a personality.
It's complex personality and the 

1026
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:20,960
personality of your ancestors that 
perfectly reasonable way of looking at.

1027
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,400
And you imitate that.
No,

1028
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:28,220
that's why we call our our laws of body 
of laws,

1029
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:31,820
and you could say that the legal system,
especially with English common law,

1030
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:37,060
is the articulate,
articulated representation of the 

1031
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,530
imitative customs and rituals of the 
entire society.

1032
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:42,050
It's been brought right up into full 
articulation,

1033
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:47,290
but it was there to begin with,
so part of where you draw your,

1034
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:54,440
your,
your material for creativity is that you

1035
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:59,441
observed the behaviors and interactions 
of all people who've been imitating all 

1036
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:02,930
people since the beginning of time and 
that's unbelievably informative.

1037
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,780
It's way more informative than you could
ever represent.

1038
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,960
You know how much information someone 
can indicate with just lifting your 

1039
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:11,780
eyebrow a quarter of an inch,
right?

1040
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:16,781
That can indicate irony in it can 
indicate the relationship of a joke to 

1041
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:20,231
another set of jokes that that person 
knows that you liked and it's very 

1042
01:00:20,231 --> 01:00:21,200
complicated.
You can't articulate all that,

1043
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:23,270
but in some sense you know it,
right?

1044
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,090
You're a player in that game.
Well,

1045
01:00:26,091 --> 01:00:28,160
now and then so then imagine,
okay,

1046
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:33,190
you've got all that embodied to the 
degree that you're a sophisticated 

1047
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:36,851
player,
then your imagination is representing 

1048
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:37,790
you and it's representing the world.

1049
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,260
So that's an abstraction,
right?

1050
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,390
Because your imagination is not the 
world.

1051
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:45,230
It's a representation of the world and 
then what you can do.

1052
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,260
So that means in the imagination there's
all sorts of information that's about 

1053
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:54,641
the imitative behavior and then then you
can talk about the image.

1054
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:57,140
That's sort of what you do when you 
interpret a dream.

1055
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,650
So what's your dream doing?
Your imagination is watching.

1056
01:01:00,651 --> 01:01:05,651
You wandered around in the world.
You know when you have your category 

1057
01:01:05,651 --> 01:01:08,991
systems and your theories and so forth 
and so then the dream puts forth what 

1058
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:13,901
that like an image,
an image istick representation of what 

1059
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:16,360
that might signify,
and it's in this weird language which is

1060
01:01:16,361 --> 01:01:18,860
an image,
an image laden language.

1061
01:01:18,861 --> 01:01:21,830
It can be.
It can range from completely incoherent,

1062
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:26,360
just juxtaposed images to unbelievably 
complex and sophisticated,

1063
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:31,600
full develop narratives and that's part 
of the process by which the information 

1064
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:36,881
that's embedded in you and the culture 
at a behavioral level moves up to the 

1065
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:40,790
imagination and then pops up into 
articulated space so you have a dream.

1066
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:44,930
The dream is about you and then you talk
about the dream and what you're doing.

1067
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:49,931
You're trying to translate the images 
into articulated representations and 

1068
01:01:49,931 --> 01:01:54,731
that's also a good way of thinking about
how memory moves from the bottom up and 

1069
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,220
what's interesting.
You know,

1070
01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:02,850
you know,
sometimes you have a realization or a 

1071
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:02,850
moment of insight,
you know,

1072
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:04,280
and that there's a feeling that goes 
along with that.

1073
01:02:04,281 --> 01:02:08,170
It's like a charge and I think it's a 
charge that you get from,

1074
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,400
from simplifying something,
but also from experiencing the new 

1075
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,320
possibilities that emerge as a 
consequence of that realization.

1076
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:20,490
What seems to happen is that you have 
the behavioral realm,

1077
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,940
let's say the things you act out and all
the things you imitates very,

1078
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:26,220
very complex.
And then on top of that,

1079
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:28,680
you have the image of that.
Right?

1080
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,090
And you're trying to get the image 
right,

1081
01:02:30,091 --> 01:02:35,091
but it's really hard because this 
changes in this floats around so you're 

1082
01:02:35,091 --> 01:02:38,721
trying to get those lined up and then on
top of that you're trying to get your 

1083
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,370
articulated representations lined up so 
that you can say what you know about who

1084
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:44,280
you are and when all those come together
and you think,

1085
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,750
man,
I've got my act together,

1086
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:47,760
but now and then you'll have an insight.

1087
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,480
You know,
you'll think,

1088
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,450
well,
like this woman who who I told you about

1089
01:02:51,451 --> 01:02:56,451
who had be molested.
The insight was while I was a little 

1090
01:02:56,451 --> 01:02:56,790
kid,
but so was my brother Bang.

1091
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:58,140
It's like,
wow,

1092
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:00,540
all sorts of things that didn't make 
sense anymore.

1093
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:05,541
Just fall into place.
You get this articulated representation 

1094
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:08,340
that can sum up a whole bunch of what 
would you call them?

1095
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:13,670
Divergent and apparently unrelated image
representations and then all of a sudden

1096
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:17,430
your path forward is clearer because you
know more about who you are and you knew

1097
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:20,340
more about how you,
where you're going.

1098
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,150
So in that is in large part what's 
happening in psychoanalysis.

1099
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:26,280
It's certainly what happens with dream 
analysis,

1100
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,380
which is something that Freud also 
pioneered,

1101
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:34,010
know Freud,
believed that dreams were wish 

1102
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,051
fulfillments and you know,
and he believed that the function of 

1103
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,930
dreams about wish fulfillments were to 
protect sleep.

1104
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:44,930
So for example,
maybe you're really thirsty and you go 

1105
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:47,460
to sleep and you dream about drinking 
water.

1106
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:52,550
Some of you who have consumed too much 
beer the night before it might be 

1107
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:56,370
familiar with those sorts of dreams and 
so you're dreaming that you're searching

1108
01:03:56,371 --> 01:04:01,371
out fountains and you're drinking and 
Freud's interpretation that would be 

1109
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:05,460
well.
You should stay asleep.

1110
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:11,270
And so the dream is providing your 
underlying interrelated motivational 

1111
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:15,420
systems.
Say the one that governs thirst with the

1112
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:18,960
fulfillment of desire.
But I think that's.

1113
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:24,050
I really think that's wrong.
Although it's weird because dreams of 

1114
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:24,120
course could be doing all sorts of 
things,

1115
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,790
but.
But what seems to happen instead,

1116
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:32,510
I realized this most particularly once I
heard about a study about the effects of

1117
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,350
testosterone cycling testosterone on 
female sexual activity.

1118
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:40,080
So the plan is this,
is that in women,

1119
01:04:40,081 --> 01:04:44,620
testosterone levels vary across the 
monthly cycle and sodas,

1120
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:49,660
sexual desire,
and what seems to happen is that as 

1121
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,780
testosterone,
testosterone increases,

1122
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:56,100
the frequency of sexual acts doesn't 
necessarily increase,

1123
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:01,280
but the frequency of sexual fantasy 
increases and so the hormone is driving 

1124
01:05:01,891 --> 01:05:05,070
the fantasies and then the fantasies 
drive the behavior.

1125
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:10,100
It's something like that.
And so the dream isn't fulfilling a 

1126
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:14,331
wish.
What it's doing is that's how the 

1127
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:16,710
motivational system manifests itself in 
a plan for action.

1128
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:17,660
It's like,
well,

1129
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,580
you should be going to look for sources 
of water if you're thirsty.

1130
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,770
And so because of the,
you know,

1131
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:26,620
your hypothalamus has to communicate 
with you somehow.

1132
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:30,190
It doesn't just grip your behavior and 
move you around like a robot,

1133
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:34,390
you know,
it has to indicate what the state,

1134
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:39,420
what state is.
It does that all sorts of ways and then 

1135
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:42,660
start tilting you towards the solution 
using your memories and your skills and 

1136
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,280
everything that would be related to 
successful outcomes of that form,

1137
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:51,090
that form in the past.
The other thing I should say about 

1138
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:54,991
creativity and,
and this is I think something very 

1139
01:05:54,991 --> 01:05:55,960
useful for understanding people's 
reactions to psychoanalysis.

1140
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:01,680
I have a lot of creative people in my 
clientele for for a variety of reasons 

1141
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,880
and some who aren't creative and 
creativity is a trade and most people 

1142
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:06,520
aren't creative.

1143
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:09,130
It's not common.
So,

1144
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,260
and some people who are creative are so 
creative.

1145
01:06:11,261 --> 01:06:13,870
It's just absolutely beyond 
comprehension.

1146
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:17,230
So the castle,
for example,

1147
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:22,410
created 65,000
works of art three a day for 65 years.

1148
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:28,060
Now that guy was created.
So anyways,

1149
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,750
lots of people aren't creative and 
they're not interested in psychoanalytic

1150
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:36,751
ideas.
So they're not interested in 

1151
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:36,751
architectural ideas.
They're not really gripped by narrative.

1152
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:38,500
So if you happen to be one marker for 
creativity,

1153
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:42,670
by the way,
for openness is really liking fiction.

1154
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:48,720
So and women actually like fiction more 
than men and because women are actually 

1155
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,650
slightly higher and part of openness 
that men are.

1156
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,460
So what else?
If you like poetry,

1157
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,400
you know,
and it gives you an aesthetics.

1158
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,090
Now,
aesthetic experience,

1159
01:06:58,091 --> 01:07:00,280
if you really get deeply involved in 
music,

1160
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:03,280
if you're able to produce things that 
are created,

1161
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,690
so if you have the kind of mind that 
works in association.

1162
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,640
So for example,
if I told you guys,

1163
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:15,320
all right,
write down as many words as you can in 

1164
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:15,490
the next three minutes that begin with 
the letter l,

1165
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:19,390
those of you who are more creative would
come up with more words.

1166
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:22,480
So there's a verbal fluency component.
I could say,

1167
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,010
okay,
um,

1168
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,650
how many uses can you think of for a 
break?

1169
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:32,220
And then I would score that.
The first would be how many uses you 

1170
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:35,461
came up with.
That'd be the sheer number I'd throw 

1171
01:07:35,461 --> 01:07:35,461
away,
the stupid ones that make no sense.

1172
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:38,160
And often you have to get a panel of 
people to,

1173
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,540
to make that judgment,
right.

1174
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,290
You,
you know,

1175
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:41,350
you could say,
well,

1176
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,260
it's a thing that you could use it as a 
thing.

1177
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:45,220
It's like,
no x,

1178
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:47,050
you don't get,
you don't get a score for that.

1179
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:52,380
So then you get another score for how 
uncommon your response was because 

1180
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,690
that's an originality dimension.

1181
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,090
And naturally,
if you calculate those two dimensions,

1182
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:03,040
fluency and originality from a divergent
thinking tasks,

1183
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:08,070
which is the what I just told you about,
you can predict how creative people are 

1184
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:11,431
quite well anyways.
The really creative people seem to have 

1185
01:08:11,431 --> 01:08:14,290
a deep wellspring of unconscious ideas 
that are always flowing forth.

1186
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:19,291
And some of those people dream like mad 
and they have extremely sophisticated 

1187
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:22,520
and complex dreams and those dreams seem
to guide their behavior.

1188
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:28,030
So and that's quite,
that's quite entertaining when you see 

1189
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:31,721
that in psychotherapy,
if you have an interest in such things 

1190
01:08:31,721 --> 01:08:31,721
and you might say,
well,

1191
01:08:31,721 --> 01:08:33,830
how do you know if your dream 
interpretation is true?

1192
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,600
And that's answer that is,
well,

1193
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:39,890
how do you know how you interpreted the 
last book you read is true?

1194
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,730
And the answer that is you don't know 
how you don't.

1195
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:46,340
And even if you did,
you don't know how you know it,

1196
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:47,180
right?

1197
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:52,180
Because lots of people can read a book 
and they come away with slightly 

1198
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,911
different interpretations of it.
And that's because did imagine that the 

1199
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:58,541
book is a multilevel pattern and then 
the reader is a multilevel pattern.

1200
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:03,140
And then if you put those two together,
you get a multilevel pattern that's made

1201
01:09:03,141 --> 01:09:08,141
out of the reader end of the book,
and that's going to be unique for every 

1202
01:09:08,141 --> 01:09:11,411
single reader except that we have 
commonalities of structure and so that 

1203
01:09:11,411 --> 01:09:14,990
we can communicate about it.
So you read a book and it strikes you,

1204
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:17,270
certain things strike you in certain 
things seem right.

1205
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:20,720
If you do a dream interpretation,
it's a collaboration between you and the

1206
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:24,110
client about the,
about the interpretation.

1207
01:09:24,111 --> 01:09:27,350
So usually what I do is I have people,
first of all,

1208
01:09:27,351 --> 01:09:30,140
they'll tell me their dream from 
beginning to end.

1209
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,560
Now Freud would say already you're 
introducing all sorts of bias because 

1210
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,170
they're not telling you the dream.

1211
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:39,890
They're telling you the dream as they 
interpret and remember it.

1212
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:40,760
It's like,
yeah,

1213
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:41,960
that's a problem.
So,

1214
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:43,370
but you do what you can,
you know.

1215
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,520
And I tell people,
just write it down as fast as you can 

1216
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,311
and try not to think about too much 
because we don't want post dream 

1217
01:09:51,311 --> 01:09:54,661
editing.
So then I'll listen to it and then then 

1218
01:09:54,661 --> 01:09:59,621
they'll tell it to me again slowly.
And then I'll listen to a sentence and 

1219
01:09:59,621 --> 01:10:01,580
I'll let my association network work on 
it and see if,

1220
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:06,640
see what that reminds me of,
and then I'll ask the person what it 

1221
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,520
reminds them of and then we'll talk 
about these.

1222
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:11,060
Those are the direct association.
So those are the things Freud would call

1223
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:12,800
free associations.
And you could say,

1224
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,220
well around every utterance,
like a sentence,

1225
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,760
there's a collection of potential 
meanings,

1226
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:23,761
right?
And those meetings might be direct 

1227
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,970
meanings,
like really tightly associated with it 

1228
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:25,970
to sort of loose meanings.

1229
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:30,910
And so you can hit it back and forth 
with the client and therapist until you 

1230
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:31,010
think,
oh yeah,

1231
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:32,330
okay.
That seems to be.

1232
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:37,630
That seems to be where that's going.
And you're also thinking about it in 

1233
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:40,451
relationship to the person's current 
life experiences and the rest of the 

1234
01:10:40,451 --> 01:10:41,870
dream and maybe all the dreams they told
you about before.

1235
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:45,950
So it's insanely complicated,
but it's what people do when they listen

1236
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:48,140
to a conversation,
you know,

1237
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,450
how do you,
how do you know your interpretation of a

1238
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:53,120
conversation is true?
Well,

1239
01:10:55,330 --> 01:11:00,330
you know,
there's a variety of ways that you can 

1240
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:02,081
approximate that.
But yet you don't know and there's lots 

1241
01:11:02,081 --> 01:11:02,081
of different ways of interpreting a 
conversation.

1242
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:04,250
That's why the postmodernists,
you know,

1243
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:06,920
ended up in their little hole with 
regards to literature.

1244
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:08,690
They realized that,
well,

1245
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,450
there's no limit to the number of ways 
you can interpret a book.

1246
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:17,020
And,
but then they took the next step which 

1247
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:17,020
was the therefore it has no meaning.
It's like,

1248
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:17,020
no,
no,

1249
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,000
no,
wrong,

1250
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:22,320
wrong.
It's very unsophisticated thinking.

1251
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:27,321
It just means that the way the book 
portrays meaning is exceedingly complex 

1252
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:31,760
and you can't describe it using normal 
linear rationality doesn't mean the 

1253
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:36,741
meaning isn't there.
That's so pathetic that it's dangerous 

1254
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:41,901
too,
because it means that nothing has any 

1255
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:41,901
meaning.
And you know,

1256
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:42,840
that's the most dangerous theory that.
So anyways,

1257
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:48,680
you talked to the person about the dream
and the dream image and what that 

1258
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:52,230
triggers off in their memory.
And you also watch what they say because

1259
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:54,930
sometimes.
So for example,

1260
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,820
someone,
this just happened recently,

1261
01:11:56,821 --> 01:12:01,821
someone might be describing a dream 
where they know where they're wandering 

1262
01:12:01,821 --> 01:12:03,780
around somewhere and they'll say,
and I'm taking the wrong road.

1263
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:04,740
You Think,
oh,

1264
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:09,741
okay,
well now we know what your dream meant 

1265
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:09,741
because he just said it.

1266
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:13,160
I'm taking the wrong road,
and that's a Freudian slip and it's so 

1267
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,820
interesting because if you listen to 
people tell their dreams,

1268
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:18,450
you have to kind of listen.
It's like they have two minds talking at

1269
01:12:18,451 --> 01:12:21,240
the same time and one is describing the 
dream,

1270
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:26,780
but the other one is describing their 
life and they don't even notice the 

1271
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:26,780
connection and you pointed out and they 
go,

1272
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:27,420
oh yeah,
right,

1273
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,980
right.
I didn't know I said that,

1274
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:34,220
and that's a Freudian slip and I think 
what's happening in part is the right 

1275
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:38,661
hemisphere,
which is an image accumulation and 

1276
01:12:38,661 --> 01:12:41,601
aggregation system.
It's kind of a low resolution pattern 

1277
01:12:41,601 --> 01:12:45,381
collection system users mostly images 
and it tries to put them together in 

1278
01:12:45,381 --> 01:12:49,701
meaningful ways,
but the meaning is vague and 

1279
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:51,240
comprehensive and then the left 
hemisphere roughly speaking,

1280
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:56,241
which is the linguistic hemisphere,
is trying to state what that says in 

1281
01:12:56,241 --> 01:12:57,900
words and it's very difficult to make 
that,

1282
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,550
to make that transformation.

1283
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:04,550
But that's why dream analysis works and 
part is because you're facilitating the 

1284
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:08,541
movement of the information in the 
images into the articulated part of the 

1285
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:10,650
personality here,
moving information up,

1286
01:13:10,651 --> 01:13:15,651
the abstraction hierarchy to the point 
where it can be well utilized and that's

1287
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:21,590
now I'll end this with all end,
this discussion of Freud with a 

1288
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:26,760
description of some research that was 
done recently by relatively recently,

1289
01:13:26,761 --> 01:13:31,761
let's say the last 20 years by this 
psychologist at the University of Texas 

1290
01:13:32,611 --> 01:13:37,611
at Austin,
who's name is James Pennebaker and 

1291
01:13:37,611 --> 01:13:38,410
pennebaker's,
particularly smart psychologist.

1292
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:43,850
He had this idea.
Freud had another idea that was related 

1293
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:47,301
to therapy and he thought that what 
happened if you came into therapy and 

1294
01:13:47,301 --> 01:13:49,890
you talked about a traumatic event,
was that you were cured by Catharsis,

1295
01:13:49,891 --> 01:13:54,891
which meant that that trauma had to have
a bunch of emotion associated with it 

1296
01:13:54,891 --> 01:13:59,211
and that was repressed,
but it was down there and kind of 

1297
01:13:59,211 --> 01:13:59,700
struggling to get up and causing you all
sorts of stress and misery.

1298
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:04,700
Trying to hold it down.
And then if you could just tell someone 

1299
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,870
about it and like express your feelings,
then that would help you.

1300
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,450
Expressing your feelings does not help 
you by the way,

1301
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,340
but,
but because that,

1302
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:17,400
that turns out to be wrong,
although it's wrong in an interesting 

1303
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:17,710
and useful way because it sort of,
it's almost right.

1304
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:22,050
So what pennebaker did was he took 
undergraduates and he had them come into

1305
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:27,060
the lab and for three sequential days 
and he had them write for 15 minutes 

1306
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:33,450
each day about the worst thing that they
had ever done or the worst thing that 

1307
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:36,511
had ever happened to them.
Often people are traumatized by 

1308
01:14:36,511 --> 01:14:37,180
something they did,
not something that happened to them.

1309
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:40,000
In fact,
more often is someone watches themselves

1310
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:42,610
do something absolutely horrific.
And then they think,

1311
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:44,650
oh my God,
I did that.

1312
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:45,730
Who am I?

1313
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,830
They don't know.
Then that's,

1314
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:49,510
you know,
things started coming unglued.

1315
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,650
So anyways,
pennebaker had them do that and then for

1316
01:14:53,651 --> 01:14:55,720
the next two weeks they felt pretty 
wretched about it.

1317
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:59,110
And so that's interesting because if 
they would have only measured the result

1318
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:02,080
of the intervention in a two week 
timespan,

1319
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:07,230
everyone would've said never,
never write down your traumatic 

1320
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:07,230
experiences because it'll make you 
worse.

1321
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:12,150
But over the next six months,
what happened in particular was that 

1322
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:14,500
their physical health improved.
They went to the doctor last year,

1323
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:19,510
reported less illness and so forth,
and it's because their overall level of 

1324
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,280
stress decreased for complex reasons 
that we can talk about later.

1325
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,400
But then pennebaker,
Vegan and they excellent scientists,

1326
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:25,390
he thought,
okay,

1327
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:29,410
well Catharsis works here.
You're expressing your trauma and Poof,

1328
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:31,780
you're fixed.
But he went back and he thought,

1329
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:35,070
well wait a second,
maybe how you express it matters.

1330
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:40,070
So we went back and he counted all the 
words that were associated with emotion 

1331
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:43,860
and all the words that were associated 
with understanding and cognition and 

1332
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:47,440
what he found was two things.
One was the more words that you use,

1333
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:52,441
particularly as your narrative developed
that indicated comprehension and 

1334
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:55,240
understanding the better you did over 
time,

1335
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:59,560
and so what happens is not,
it's not the expressing of your emotion,

1336
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:05,010
it's the expressing of your emotion and 
then the weaving of the memory into a 

1337
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:11,070
new coherent representation from which 
you derive a moral.

1338
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:15,670
So what's the moral of a trauma?
Don't let it happen again.

1339
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:21,150
That's the moral and the threat systems 
are going to be throwing that thing up 

1340
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:22,570
at you constantly until you figure it 
out.

1341
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:26,020
How did I get into this?
How do I avoid it in the future?

1342
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,780
That doesn't mean it's your fault,
but your anxiety systems,

1343
01:16:28,781 --> 01:16:29,740
they don't care about that.

1344
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:34,330
They care about how you're not going to 
fall into the same hole and the only way

1345
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:37,870
to do that is to analyze the causal 
pathways that lead to the whole to begin

1346
01:16:37,871 --> 01:16:42,871
with and see if you can either 
reconfigure your behavior and your 

1347
01:16:42,871 --> 01:16:43,750
attitudes so that that doesn't happen 
again,

1348
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,780
or maybe you just don't go those places 
anymore.

1349
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:52,230
You know either way and you're the 
trauma threat systems.

1350
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:57,930
As soon as you come up with a 
comprehensive representation that you 

1351
01:16:57,930 --> 01:16:59,080
believe in,
they'll leave you alone,

1352
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:02,380
and this can happen very,
very rapidly with nightmares.

1353
01:17:02,381 --> 01:17:07,381
I've,
I've cured people's nightmares in one 

1354
01:17:07,381 --> 01:17:07,381
session,
no problem.

1355
01:17:07,381 --> 01:17:10,950
I asked them to bring their nightwear to
opt in to their imagination.

1356
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:13,520
Maybe someone's chasing them.
It's like,

1357
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:16,220
okay,
think about them chasing.

1358
01:17:16,221 --> 01:17:18,470
You got to visualize it.
Really visualize it.

1359
01:17:18,471 --> 01:17:20,060
The more real you make it,
the better.

1360
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,530
Okay.
They're being chased.

1361
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:23,390
How are you feeling?
I'm all anxious and afraid.

1362
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,930
Okay,
turn around and look at the thing that's

1363
01:17:26,931 --> 01:17:29,210
chasing you.
So they do that.

1364
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,610
Then maybe they tell,
say what it is or whatever,

1365
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:33,770
but maybe they don't even do that and I 
say,

1366
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:35,390
okay,
now before you go to bed at night,

1367
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:40,930
just when you're almost falling asleep,
you're in a hypnagogic state where 

1368
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:41,450
images are starting to come.
You run that,

1369
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:47,050
they run that Poof,
that nightmare is gone and the reason 

1370
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:49,610
for it is that they've now reconfigured 
themselves as the thing,

1371
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:52,700
not the thing that's being chased.
That's prey animal.

1372
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:58,210
They've configured themselves as the 
thing that can turn around and face the 

1373
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:02,831
thing that's chasing them and that's the
same Motif as the dragon haunting the 

1374
01:18:03,441 --> 01:18:08,441
union archetypes,
right face what you're afraid of it not 

1375
01:18:08,441 --> 01:18:09,410
will cure you,
and that's really one of the fundamental

1376
01:18:09,411 --> 01:18:14,411
motifs of Freud and psychoanalysis.
So you know you have an exam on 

1377
01:18:14,411 --> 01:18:19,301
Thursday.
I'll post questions about sort of 

1378
01:18:19,301 --> 01:18:20,720
representative questions on the exam 
when I get home after this lecture,

1379
01:18:20,721 --> 01:18:22,580
probably this evening,
the latter there.

1380
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,850
The essays are,
the test is here.

1381
01:18:25,851 --> 01:18:28,820
It's multiple choice.
You'll have no problem finishing it.

1382
01:18:28,821 --> 01:18:31,370
It's not that loan,
and if you've done the readings and come

1383
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:33,710
to the lectures,
you'll probably do fine.

1384
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:36,880
So it's not a tricky test.
