1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,790
Okay,
so today we're going to talk about,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,230
oh,
openness.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:07,820
Now

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,580
you might say in some sense that 
openness is the last discovered that the

5
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:20,581
big five traits,
and it's also the one I would say that 

6
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,370
comes up most weekly in the factor 
analysis.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,550
When Hans ising formulated his trait 
representation,

8
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:31,870
which was extroversion,
neuroticism and psychotic system.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,750
He,

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,550
I felt that he encapsulated all of the 
fundamental variation in human 

11
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:45,390
personality and nick and he was loathed 
to include intelligence as a personality

12
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:47,910
trait.
Now,

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,380
the relationship between psychologists,
ISM and openness is rather complex.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Isaac basically felt that people could 
be extroverted and that would be the 

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,250
positive dimension.
It could be,

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,930
you know,
high in negative emotion.

17
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:05,931
That'd be the negative emotion dimension
and that they also could have a 

18
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:07,560
predisposition to psychosis and I guess 
that would be.

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,310
He was thinking about the brain systems 
that underlie schizophrenia and that 

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,650
that tendency to dissociate and,
and develop hallucinations,

21
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:24,081
but also maybe the system in human 
beings that are affected by 

22
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:29,601
hallucinogenic drugs,
which seemed to affect human beings 

23
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:31,080
differently than they have their other 
creatures.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,740
So.
But Isaac psychotic eventually was 

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,120
broken down into low agreeableness and 
low conscientiousness.

26
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:44,121
It didn't predict the predisposition to 
psychosis at all and later factor 

27
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:49,311
analysis found that you could load out 
intelligence and creativity as a 

28
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,290
personality dimension separately.

29
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,830
Now it's a bit tricky because you have 
Iq measures and Iq measures are much 

30
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,640
more direct measures of intelligence 
than the personality measures.

31
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:03,690
I mean the personality measure is 
something like,

32
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,620
do you think you're smart?
You know,

33
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:12,621
I mean I'm being a bit flip about that 
because it's more sophisticated than 

34
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:17,511
that,
but when you talk about someone as a 

35
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,671
smart person,
you're generally referring to the trait 

36
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:22,851
that we would describe as openness.
You also are doing that when you refer 

37
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,920
to the to creativity as a,
as a previous position,

38
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,430
and you could measure the smart part a 
lot better with ICU and ICU is also a 

39
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:36,561
pretty good predictor of creativity so 
well.

40
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:41,721
So let's see how they're associated.
So he remembered that you have your big 

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,230
two traits.
Stability of plasticity and stability 

42
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,800
breaks down into conscientiousness,
emotional stability and agreeableness,

43
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:53,640
and then you can see how each of the 
aspects are correlated.

44
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,640
How highly they're correlated,
so industriousness and orderliness at 

45
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,031
about point for volatility,
withdrawal and emotional stability or 

46
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:06,211
neuroticism.
Actually about point six and 

47
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:08,050
agreeableness and politeness at about 
point four,

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,620
and then the next trait is extroversion 
and openness that makes plasticity and 

49
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:19,840
people who were high in plasticity tend 
to be good entrepreneurs by the way,

50
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,100
and extroversion rates into 
assertiveness and enthusiasm correlated 

51
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:30,760
at about point five and then openness 
and intelligence.

52
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,280
And the correlation there is lower.
It's point three,

53
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:38,281
five.
The average correlation between the big 

54
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:39,850
five is point two and the correlation 
between the big two is about point two.

55
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:43,060
And so you have to remember,
you might ask yourself,

56
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:48,061
well,
is a correlation of point for twice as 

57
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,250
large as a correlation of point to 
announce to that is no,

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,190
because you have to square them to 
compare them arithmetically.

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,850
So a correlation of point to point,
oh,

60
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,740
four,
four percent squared,

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,400
right?

62
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,910
And a correlation port for gives you 16 
percent squared.

63
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,970
So there's actually a difference of a 
factor of four.

64
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,630
And so you need to remember that when 
you're considering effect sizes so that 

65
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,160
you can understand exactly what they 
mean.

66
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:20,161
Now you know,
if you're accounting for 16 percent of 

67
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,161
the variance,
which would be a correlation of point 

68
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:25,321
four,
then that leaves 84 percent left 

69
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:28,351
unexplained.
But that's a bit of an overstatement 

70
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,730
most of the time in psychology because 
our measures are are rather imperfect.

71
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,430
And so for example,
if you give someone a personality test 

72
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:43,720
and let's say that the validity of their
self report is about point six,

73
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:46,120
three point seven,
which is probably what it is,

74
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,160
maybe it might be a little bit higher 
than that.

75
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,820
So that's,
that means that they're self reporting 

76
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,320
is only picking up 50 percent of the 
variation in their personality.

77
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,210
And if you pick up,
you know,

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
if,
if your are,

79
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,220
if an are derived from that measure 
accounts for 16 percent of the variance 

80
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,421
in some sense it's twice as powerful as 
it appears to be because the measure is 

81
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:13,231
so error ridden.
And a lot of the things that we measure 

82
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:16,411
in psychology are error written.
And what that means is that the 

83
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,050
correlations are generally what it 
means,

84
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:20,170
although not in variable isn't the 
correlations are bigger than they look.

85
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,530
In any case,
the correlations that come up in 

86
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,030
personality research are certainly big 
enough to be meaningful.

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,240
And I would say meaningful in terms of 
predicting major life outcomes and 

88
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,230
predicting important economic outcomes 
and that sort of thing.

89
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,390
So,
all right,

90
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:42,391
so one of the things you might ask 
yourself is exactly what does 

91
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:48,080
intelligence measure.
So we'll start with intelligence from,

92
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,860
from the and that would be equivalent to
intellect,

93
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:53,260
ruffin speaking.
So intellect in the big five,

94
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,440
the aspect seems to be associated with 
interest in ideas.

95
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Whereas the openness proper aspect seems
to be associated with aesthetic 

96
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:08,951
sensibility and creativity.
That's the best way to think about as 

97
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:13,720
far as we've been able to figure out.
And the biggest relationship is between 

98
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,370
into intellect and intelligence as 
measured psychometrically.

99
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,580
Now intelligence is an interesting 
concept.

100
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,000
It's very controversial.
In fact,

101
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:23,990
if you.

102
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,660
One of the things that continually 
happens over and over again in 

103
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,331
psychology is that psychologists 
discover all sorts of new kinds of 

104
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:35,000
intelligence.
And you know,

105
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:37,580
the biggest two proponents of that sort 
of thing,

106
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:42,581
I suppose we're Bob Sternberg who came 
up with this thing he called practical 

107
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:46,031
intelligence and then Howard Gardner who
came up with the theory of multiple 

108
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,100
intelligences which had a very large 
effect on educational psychology,

109
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,040
um,
when the theory was first proposed.

110
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,470
And that's not saying much because 
generally speaking,

111
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:59,471
it's very difficult to find a discipline
that's more susceptible to fads and 

112
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,750
educational psychology.
And as far as I can tell,

113
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,840
generally speaking,
each fat is worse than the previous one.

114
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,390
So no gardener positive that I think 
there were seven.

115
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,140
Oh,
there they are,

116
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:16,070
seven or eight different intelligences,
linguistic,

117
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,210
musical,
logical,

118
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,340
mathematical,
spacial body,

119
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:22,940
kinesthetic,
interpersonal and interpersonal.

120
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,330
And people talk about emotional 
intelligence and they talk about 

121
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:28,330
practical intelligence.

122
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,710
And as far as I'm concerned,
all of that's complete rubbish.

123
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,310
And there's technical reasons for that.
I mean there's technical and 

124
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,271
philosophical reasons for that.
The first thing is you can't just mess 

125
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:44,411
up a word,
you know the whole point of having a 

126
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:47,201
word is so that it defined some things 
that described some things and doesn't 

127
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:47,330
describe other things.
Right,

128
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,540
and so you can.
You can make the word intelligence 

129
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,950
account for whatever you want so you can
say that the ability to dance as a form 

130
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,661
of intelligence,
but the problem with that is you blur 

131
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,530
out the word so badly.
You can't tell what it means anymore,

132
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:09,010
and so,
and I would also point out we had 

133
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,961
perfectly good words for those major 
intelligence as we called them talents 

134
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:15,610
and so it's perfectly reasonable to make
a distinction between the talent and 

135
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,850
intelligence.
Now you might say,

136
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,710
well,
how the hell do you know the difference?

137
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,800
Like if if things look similar to some 
degree,

138
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,650
then how do you know if they're the same
or different?

139
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:29,651
Well,
that's exactly what you do when you do 

140
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:31,541
the construct validity process.
So let's say you rated a number of 

141
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:36,221
people on their dancing ability and then
you rated a number of people on their 

142
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:40,481
ability to multiply two digit,
two digit numbers in their head quickly 

143
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,240
while then you see technically if both 
of those were intelligences than the 

144
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:51,791
people who could dance better could 
multiply two digit numbers faster in 

145
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,481
their head and they would be slightly.
Sorry.

146
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,530
See that's what happens when I don't 
have any diet coke.

147
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,290
So anyways,
if intelligence was the right word to 

148
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,221
subsume both of those,
then what you see is that would be a 

149
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:17,361
high correlation with people who are 
good dancers would also be the ones who 

150
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:20,541
could multiply most rapidly and I mean 
multiply in their head but that.

151
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,290
But you're not going to be able to 
extract out a single factor like that.

152
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,020
It's just not.
It's just not the case that those things

153
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:36,021
associate like that.
So for something to be one phenomena,

154
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,610
the things that it.
Hmm,

155
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,910
obviously I've talked too much this 
semester.

156
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,460
All the things that are subsumed under 
that definition have to be correlated 

157
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,280
and highly correlated because otherwise 
they're not the same thing.

158
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,670
It's the definition of the same thing.
Now,

159
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Iq is a very peculiar construct,
a very unique construct from a 

160
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:15,141
psychological perspective,
but also more generally from a social 

161
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:18,891
science perspective because Iq has the 
most predictive validity of anything 

162
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:22,440
ever discovered in the social sciences 
period.

163
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,490
Now another thing that is interesting 
about Iq is that a lot of the people who

164
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:35,391
were interested early in the measurement
of intelligence were engineers,

165
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:40,521
turned psychologists and the engineers 
have actually had quite a whopping 

166
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:44,811
effect on psychology.
Part of the reason that psychology has 

167
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,670
an advanced methodology and advanced 
statistical techniques is because we got

168
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:51,120
invaded by engineers in the early part 
of the 20th century,

169
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,150
and so the engineer has made our 
measurements much more rigorous than 

170
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,150
they would have otherwise been.

171
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,990
And it's been a huge advantage.
I mean,

172
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,380
one of the things that's happening to 
psychology is it starting to eat other 

173
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,011
disciplines,
so it's had a massive effect on 

174
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:08,100
economics and it's going to have a 
massive effect on political science.

175
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:13,101
And the reason for that is because we 
know how to measure things and it 

176
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:13,770
actually turns out to matter that you 
know how to measure things.

177
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,190
Obviously.
I mean if you're going to be talking 

178
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,190
about something that's specific and well
defined,

179
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,800
first of all,
if you can't make it specific and 

180
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,900
well-defined,
all you can really do is argue about it 

181
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,900
and you know there are better and worse 
arguments.

182
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:35,901
But the problem is,
is that just because of an argument is 

183
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:35,901
good,
doesn't mean it's right.

184
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,910
And that's a big problem.
It's also something to remember when 

185
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,521
you're arguing about people that you 
have a relationship with because you 

186
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:46,951
know,
if you happen to be better at 

187
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:46,951
structuring your arguments and your more
verbally fluent man,

188
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,300
perhaps more assertive and maybe less 
agreeable,

189
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,440
you're going to win the arguments.
But that doesn't mean you're right.

190
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,770
It's unfortunately,
it's not that simple.

191
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,400
And so as far as I can tell me,
empirical process is the only way of 

192
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,391
getting rid of the is restricting or 
eliminating the catastrophic,

193
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,580
the detrimental effects,
pure theory

194
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,380
now and

195
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,250
well.
And our measurement techniques had been 

196
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,250
pretty good about that.
Okay.

197
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,190
So now what happens with ICU here,
I can define Iq for you,

198
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,300
just so you know what it is.
So imagine that you had a library of 

199
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,010
questions.
So here's some questions.

200
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:32,730
So there's millions of questions in this
data bank.

201
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,020
What's two times 68?
What's the capital of Georgia?

202
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:39,450
What's the definition of hypertrichosis 
anemia?

203
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,720
What comes after in this sequence?
Two,

204
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,470
four,
eight,

205
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,280
16.

206
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,140
Remember these numbers?
So I'd tell you the numbers and then 

207
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,920
you'd have to tell me that back to four.
One,

208
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:53,580
three,
five,

209
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:56,330
seven,
six slash 12 slash 15 slash 14.

210
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,270
18,
20,

211
00:12:57,271 --> 00:13:02,271
22.
And then I might ask you in fact to 

212
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:03,150
remember them backwards.
And that's a working memory task.

213
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,410
So,
okay.

214
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:09,411
So those are all questions that require.
They require abstraction and mental 

215
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:09,630
operations.
That's,

216
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,660
that's the key as far as I can tell.
So you might say,

217
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:15,540
well exactly what constitutes an 
abstraction.

218
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,140
And it looks to me like what an 
abstraction is.

219
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,880
There's the capacity to formulate it and
abstraction.

220
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,200
There's the capacity to manipulate them 
to formulate an abstraction.

221
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:30,201
I think what you do is you take a 
phenomena and you represent it with 

222
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:34,191
something that's low resolution,
that's more or less what an abstraction 

223
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:34,191
is.
So for example,

224
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,870
if I imagined this classroom later,
um,

225
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,330
my,
my imagine grip presentation is going to

226
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:45,660
be a much lower resolution than the 
actual classroom,

227
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,780
but it's sufficient for certain 
purposes,

228
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:53,010
just like a thumbnail on a computer is 
sufficient for certain purposes.

229
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:57,280
And then once I simplified the,
the,

230
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,680
the phenomena in question,
then I can also perform certain 

231
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,820
operations on it,
say in imagination or semantically,

232
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,640
and the capacity to generate that 
abstraction and the Trans Admin,

233
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,970
the ability to manipulate those seems to
be the core element of intelligence.

234
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:18,030
And I think part of the reason why 
intelligence,

235
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,510
roughly speaking as a human dimension,
although you know,

236
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,190
obviously you can,
you can,

237
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,850
you can to some degree rank order 
animals in terms of their capacity to 

238
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,931
learn.
But there's this whopping 

239
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:34,460
differentiation between human beings and
animals in this area particularly is 

240
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:36,960
because we can use abstractions.
Now,

241
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,440
I heard a woman named Temple grandin 
speak once and it was very interesting 

242
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,930
talk.
She's very autistic and uh,

243
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,280
but very,
very,

244
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,460
very brilliant,
which is not very common for people who 

245
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,491
are autistic.
Usually it's associated with a 

246
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:55,491
substantial amount of intellectual 
impairment,

247
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:59,621
but she also had an extraordinarily 
devoted parent who spent almost all of 

248
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:04,250
her time trying to pull her daughter out
of her autistic isolation.

249
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Now grandon has gone on to become the 
University of Chicago professor and she 

250
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:12,470
works in,
in the agricultural area,

251
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:16,170
and she has redesigned the miss,
the shoots,

252
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,230
the walkways basically that take cattle 
to the slaughterhouse and she's done 

253
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,260
that to make them less,
much less stressful for the animals.

254
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:29,261
And part of the reason that she can do 
that as far as she's concerned is 

255
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,931
because she thinks like an animal.
And what that means as far as she can 

256
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,250
tell is that she cannot generate an 
abstraction.

257
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,710
Not Easily.
Now she can speak.

258
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:38,690
So obviously she learned to do it to 
some degree,

259
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:43,691
but she talked more about inner talk,
more about deficits in imagination or 

260
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:47,651
concretization of imagination.
So one of the weird things that you see 

261
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:48,980
with autistic kids,
not frequently,

262
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:53,981
but now.
And then there's actually a famous 

263
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:53,981
example of this on the web,
there's a guy,

264
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:56,870
I think he's from Britain and you can 
take them in a helicopter and fly over a

265
00:15:56,871 --> 00:16:01,700
city and then he can stand in front of a
piece of paper like 12 by eight,

266
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,850
start anywhere and draw the entire city,
you know,

267
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,270
and now and then you see autistic savant
who were children who can draw perfectly

268
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:11,720
realistically.

269
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,410
And so maybe they'll draw a horse and 
they don't even start the horse.

270
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:17,240
Like a kid would,
like a normal kid would,

271
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,450
would sketch the outline of the horse 
and put some eyes in,

272
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,830
you know,
they start anywhere and make the horse 

273
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,550
perfectly detailed.
And what he claimed was that.

274
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,170
So she said,
okay,

275
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:34,010
you think of,
think of house or think of church.

276
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,640
And she says,
what comes to mind if you think of 

277
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:39,640
church?
And maybe she'd say,

278
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,061
well you get this little image of 
something that sort of shaped like this 

279
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:45,150
with a steeple on top or a cross or 
something like that.

280
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,900
And that's the church.
And so maybe you think of house and it's

281
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:49,530
like little kids house,
you know what's going to.

282
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,960
It's got a rectangle and a parallel and 
Graham that's not a Parallelogram,

283
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:58,961
whatever the hell you called up things 
on the top and then it's got a chimney 

284
00:16:58,961 --> 00:16:58,961
with smoke coming out of it,
right?

285
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:00,560
Two windows and the door house.
Yeah.

286
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,600
But there,
there are no houses like that.

287
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,710
Like each individual house looks a lot 
different than that.

288
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,260
And so in order to have that conception 
of house,

289
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:14,261
what essentially what you have to do is 
you have to take the class of all 

290
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:17,651
possible houses and extract out the 
features that are in common across all 

291
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,250
of them.
And that's an abstraction.

292
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:24,230
And so as far as brandon is concerned,
she doesn't have abstractions like that,

293
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,020
which when you asked her to remember to 
think of church,

294
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:31,220
she remembers at Church it's always 
singular instances.

295
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,980
Now the thing about human beings is 
that,

296
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,450
you know,
we perceive singular instances to some 

297
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,151
degree,
although I think our abstraction 

298
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:43,151
capacity all often interferes with our 
ability to do that.

299
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:46,970
But we also perceive abstractions,
and you can kind of tell this,

300
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,550
if you're ever trying to learn to draw,
like if I say draw a hand,

301
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,110
you guys,
most of you,

302
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:57,111
unless you have artistic training,
you're going to drop what's essentially 

303
00:17:57,111 --> 00:17:57,510
a hero,
Pacific hand.

304
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,920
And I,
I think the drawings,

305
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:02,010
the children come up with art drawings.
I think their hero glyphs,

306
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,940
they're abstracted representations that 
are quasi linguistic.

307
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,150
They're not artwork there pro the 
language,

308
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:09,990
right?
And so,

309
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,580
and here are glyphs,
of course,

310
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,380
we're one of the earliest forms of 
written language.

311
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:15,780
It makes sense because if you want to 
communicate about something,

312
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:17,670
why not draw an image,
you know?

313
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:19,740
And then eventually the image turns into
a word.

314
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:24,741
But I actually think that's the thing,
that's the developmental progression of 

315
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:26,520
language among human beings.
It's the abstract image first,

316
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:28,750
and then it's the word.
Um,

317
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,690
anyways,
you know,

318
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:35,691
if you drew a hand,
you'd like to draw hero glyphic hand 

319
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:35,850
five fingers or maybe even four,
right?

320
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,890
Because that's what they do.
That's what animators do.

321
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:40,410
You can't fit all those sausages on one 
circle,

322
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,230
you know,
so they just simplify it down to four.

323
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,830
No one even cares.
You Watch an animation animated program,

324
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,360
which is highly abstracted,
right?

325
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,810
I mean homer Simpson,
it looks nothing like an actual person,

326
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:57,110
like really tremendously.
Unlike an actual person that's 

327
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,110
completely irrelevant,
you know,

328
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,370
after two or three seconds,
it doesn't matter at all.

329
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,370
Which is also why I think three d movies
never really.

330
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,400
It's never a technology that's ever 
caught on.

331
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:07,680
It's after the first four seconds.
Who the hell cares?

332
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,710
It's irrelevant whether you see it in 
three dimensions because you don't need 

333
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,190
much information to actually structure 
your perception.

334
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Now,
if you want to see your hand weirdly 

335
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,520
enough so that you can draw it,
you have to snap out of your normal mode

336
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:25,521
of perception.
I find it's often a lot easier to do 

337
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:25,620
that with one eye closed,
his flattens it out,

338
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,190
and then you have to stop looking at 
your hand as if it's a hand.

339
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,490
You have to look at it again like it's 
an object and as soon as you do that,

340
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:35,540
it's actually rather shocking because 
it's such a strange looking thing.

341
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:40,541
Like if you.
If you put your hand in a non canonical 

342
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:40,770
position,
that's a canonical position.

343
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:44,370
I would say you put your hand in the non
canonical position and then look at it.

344
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:46,430
It's,
it's the weirdest shape thing.

345
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,740
It's quite shocking to see it and then 
you can draw it once.

346
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:52,620
You can actually see it like that,
but before that you're pretty much stuck

347
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,420
in hand.
So.

348
00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:00,170
So anyways,
I think what happens with intelligence 

349
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,090
is that people are capable of 
abstracting and then they can manipulate

350
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,720
abstractions and so let's take another 
look at what abstractions might be.

351
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:12,110
So now part of the reason I think that 
abstraction is so useful is because 

352
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,320
things are really,
really complicated and it's going to be 

353
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,201
a lot more difficult to manipulate the 
actual thing that to manipulate some 

354
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:22,260
represent to the abstraction of it.

355
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,970
So if you could get an abstraction that 
that captures the gist of the entity.

356
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,520
Now how will we do that is not exactly 
obvious,

357
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:34,521
but if you can then you can expend a lot
more resources concentrating on the 

358
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:36,420
relevant parts of the,
of the entity,

359
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:39,420
and a lot less time concentrating on the
irrelevant parts.

360
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,820
So you know,
so for example,

361
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:46,440
if you ask a child to draw a house,
what color the house is is irrelevant.

362
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,100
Now,
why it's irrelevant.

363
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:53,101
It's not exactly obvious.
I guess it's because color can vary 

364
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:56,101
across houses and color varies across 
all sorts of other things and so color 

365
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:01,170
it turns out to be a non canonical 
element of house so you can just 

366
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:01,420
dispense with it.
When you're thinking about a house,

367
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,720
you'd say,
well it doesn't matter what color the 

368
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:06,720
house is,
it's still a house.

369
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,440
So what exactly defines those features 
that make something a house rather than 

370
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,670
something else or are not that easy to 
figure out.

371
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,900
You know,
you could say,

372
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:18,901
well how's has four walls and a roof and
those are the external walls.

373
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:22,360
And I guess you could identify the 
minimal necessary components,

374
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,730
but even that's not so,
so simple.

375
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:30,330
And you could say a house is also 
something that someone lives in which 

376
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,771
allows you to put caves as houses 
because caves obviously share very 

377
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:38,401
little in common with a standard house.
So my point is,

378
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:43,551
is that it's difficult exactly to figure
out what set of features we do use to 

379
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:46,150
determine whether something is a member 
of a class.

380
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,810
There's this guy named a Gig or answer 
who's thought about this a lot and he 

381
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,011
thinks that we,
that there are a combination of 

382
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:58,680
objective and functional basically.
And that enables us to do things like 

383
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,430
come up with the category of things you 
would take from your apartment if it was

384
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:05,620
on fire was a really interesting 
category,

385
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:10,621
right?
Because most of the things that you're 

386
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:10,621
going to take bear very little 
resemblance.

387
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:11,050
It's hard to see why they make a 
category.

388
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,940
Pat's family members probably in that 
order.

389
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,310
Um,
photo albums,

390
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,580
identification.
What else might you take if you were 

391
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:23,580
your phone,
I suppose,

392
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,320
what else would you take out of an 
apartment during a fire?

393
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,450
Well,
you guys would be out on the street 

394
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,940
stark naked obviously.
So while you get the point is that you 

395
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,131
know,
those things that are just mentioned 

396
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:40,330
seem to share very little in terms of 
objective features in common,

397
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,760
but there's some reason that they still 
go here as a category.

398
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:43,960
All right?
So anyways,

399
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:45,520
why do you need to abstract?
Well,

400
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:48,310
because you can handle the complexity of
the world better.

401
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,890
Even your perception is a form of 
abstraction,

402
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,230
you know,
because when you look at someone,

403
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,340
a lot of the abstraction has done for 
you because you just can't perceive very

404
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:58,600
well.
But when you look at someone,

405
00:22:58,601 --> 00:23:03,601
first of all,
you only see the surface of them that's 

406
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:04,420
facing you and not the other surface.
So that's a big limitation.

407
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:09,760
You only see them now in this split 
second rather than extended across time.

408
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,480
You don't see any of their 
microstructure right beyond the,

409
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:19,020
beyond the general pattern of the 
physiology at this level of resolution,

410
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:21,280
you don't see anything below that.

411
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,460
I can't see yourselves or your organs or
anything like that,

412
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:29,461
which is actually a real problem often 
for us and I can't see the systems that 

413
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:31,210
you're part of.
So right off the bat,

414
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:36,211
just to perceive,
gives you a low resolution 

415
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:38,590
representation and that lot of that's 
limitations of your process and your 

416
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,421
eyes just can't zoom in that far.
You don't have the cortical capacity to 

417
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:42,650
improve your vision,
you know,

418
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,980
plus how much do you really want to see 
it one time,

419
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,540
no more than necessary,
whatever that means.

420
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,940
And evolution seems to take care of that
problem.

421
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,780
So your perception abstracts for you 
right away,

422
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:58,781
but then I would say maybe you make a 
leap from perception to conception or 

423
00:23:58,781 --> 00:24:03,040
something like that.
And so that would be the leap from the 

424
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,800
perception of the actual object to the 
image of the object.

425
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,340
And then elite from the image of the 
object to the word.

426
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,520
So it looks to me like a word is a 
representation of an image which is a 

427
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,570
representation of a,
an an object or situation.

428
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,180
It's something like that.
So,

429
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,080
and you need those because you have to 
deal with the complex world.

430
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:22,850
So here's,
here's one way of thinking about it.

431
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:25,670
So look at the top left corner of that 
diagram.

432
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:30,671
So I called that the thing in itself and
what it is is it's an array of dots 

433
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,460
roughly speaking and I think there's 360
dots there and you might say,

434
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:41,861
well,
and then if it was a real world object 

435
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:43,640
you could imagine that would be in three
dimensions not to because that's too,

436
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,720
and it would be transforming because it 
would be also extended across time.

437
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,230
So and it would have micro structures 
that were far smaller than that and 

438
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,600
macro structures that were far bigger,
but so even that is an abstraction,

439
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:57,480
but it's,
I'm,

440
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,600
I'm,
I'm using a fairly complex abstraction 

441
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:02,630
to rip represent the thing in itself.

442
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,440
That's the thing you cannot perceive,
right?

443
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,450
What something actually is you just get 
an image and then the next five things 

444
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,500
are ways you could look at that.
So you could say,

445
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:15,230
well it's a rectangle.
You could say it's four rectangles.

446
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,290
And forget about the dots.
You could say that it's,

447
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,500
I think that 16 lines or what is it?
30 two lines,

448
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,210
a 24 lines.
So if you were going to,

449
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:30,350
if that thing in itself was an orchard 
and you are going to walk north,

450
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,530
south to north through it,
that would be a good representation.

451
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,680
You know,
those would be corridors roughly 

452
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,081
speaking and then object for is a 
combination of object one and object to 

453
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:45,791
and then object five is well all of it's
blurred out or the little groups of six 

454
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:50,000
dogs and so you might say,
well what is that thing?

455
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,910
And then the answer is well it's any of 
those five things.

456
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,360
And so that's an interesting way of 
thinking about it too because one of the

457
00:25:56,361 --> 00:26:01,361
things that shows you is that you can 
disagree about what something is right 

458
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:02,090
at the level of perception and then you 
might say,

459
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:04,670
well which of those is the best 
representation?

460
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,510
And the first answer might be,
well the most complex one,

461
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:12,980
the top one on the left hand corner,
but that's not necessarily the case.

462
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:16,970
It might depend on what you want the 
representation for like imagine.

463
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:22,180
It's weird.
It's weird because imagine you have a 

464
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,180
map.
Okay.

465
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,490
And so you think,
well,

466
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:27,491
I'm going to make the best map in the 
world and so you make a map that's 

467
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:30,671
exactly the same size as the territory 
that it represents and has all the 

468
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:34,781
detail.
Well that's not any use at all that 

469
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:36,560
thing because you could just use the 
territory,

470
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,880
right?
So you know the,

471
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:43,180
just because as a map gets increasingly 
detailed to some degree,

472
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:46,530
it's increasingly useless as a map.

473
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,830
And so what you need is this weird 
combination between accuracy and 

474
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,491
simplicity.
And so you want your map to be no more 

475
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:57,630
complicated than is necessary to take 
you from point a to point b.

476
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,140
that's it.
So because otherwise it wouldn't be 

477
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,261
simple to use and the additional 
complexity would eliminate the utility 

478
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:07,020
of the,
of the map.

479
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,560
So,
so you might say that what we're trying 

480
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,471
to do with our intelligence is to get 
what we need with the least amount of 

481
00:27:15,471 --> 00:27:16,590
effort possible.
And,

482
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,160
and you know,
there's sort of a psg eddie and idea 

483
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,830
that's lurking behind that,
which is,

484
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:25,310
well,
you know,

485
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,590
you have limited resources.
You don't want to expend any more energy

486
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:31,710
than is necessary.
And you want to build representations of

487
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:36,711
the world that suffice to keep you going
now and then next week and next month,

488
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:41,610
and then you know alone and then in 
groups and so you build a representation

489
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:45,600
of the world that has some concordance 
with the thing in itself,

490
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:50,601
but has this functional simplicity so 
that you could actually use it in the 

491
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:51,090
real world.
All right,

492
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:56,091
so back to this diagram.
So I've got the object and five 

493
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,910
representations and then there are ways 
of representing it linguistically at the

494
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:00,420
bottom.

495
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,020
So

496
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,660
what that is,
the words are basically a simplification

497
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:08,430
of something that's already simplified.
So,

498
00:28:08,431 --> 00:28:13,431
okay,
so intelligence seems to have something 

499
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:16,020
to do with the process of functional 
simplification.

500
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Now back to the library of questions.
So you have this database of questions 

501
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:30,400
and so then what you do is pull out 100 
questions randomly.

502
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,910
All right?
And you want to pick out 100?

503
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:38,911
Because if you just pick out one,
like if I asked you what the capital of 

504
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:42,811
Georgia was and I asked you what the 
capital of Georgia was and you got it 

505
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:44,590
wrong and you got it right.
I couldn't really say with any degree of

506
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:49,591
certainty that that means that you have 
more intelligence because the 

507
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:52,570
probability that I get an accurate 
measure with one question is quite low,

508
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,540
but if I use three questions while then

509
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,860
you know,
I would,

510
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,930
I would start to become.
My measurement would start to become 

511
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,970
less error written and if I use 10,
it would even be better if I use 20.

512
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,930
For a personality questionnaire.
The rule of thumb,

513
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:14,931
and this is just a rule of thumb,
is that if you don't have 20 questions 

514
00:29:14,931 --> 00:29:19,251
in the questionnaire,
then you don't have enough questions to 

515
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:20,970
really generate a reliable measure.
So you'll still.

516
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:25,260
You'll still see single item measures 
used in psychology,

517
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:30,261
but you can add additional accuracy bike
by increasing the number of items.

518
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,360
I designed an Iq test a while back and 
we got a pretty good.

519
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,300
We got pretty good reliability and 
pretty good validity.

520
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Reliability as you know,
you test the same set of people twice 

521
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,000
and the rank order of their performance 
stays the same.

522
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,460
So if you've got 90 on the previous 
test,

523
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:53,461
you'd get 90 and if you've got 95 
because you're more intelligent than 

524
00:29:53,461 --> 00:29:54,880
this example,
if you've got 95 in the last one,

525
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,080
you'd get 95 on this one.

526
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,990
So that's reliability.
You can get a pretty,

527
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:01,810
we could get it pretty reliable Iq test 
with nine items,

528
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:06,420
but it was substantially improved with 
17 and with increments,

529
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:07,270
you know,
you get a,

530
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,410
uh,
what do you call it?

531
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,900
Diminishing returns.
So a hundreds,

532
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,280
20,
okay,

533
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:17,281
so you pull out a 100 questions and then
you take 100 people and you give them 

534
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:21,130
those questions and then you score them 
right and wrong.

535
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:23,890
That's all there is.
And then you sum the scores.

536
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:26,110
Okay?
So basically that,

537
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,550
that the sun behaves like the average.
Let's say you average the scores just to

538
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:33,640
make the argument a little bit more 
straightforward,

539
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,630
you average the scores and so each of 
you gets the average of,

540
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,800
you know,
a calculated across the times that you 

541
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,491
were right and wrong.
So it's an approximation of the 

542
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:48,220
frequency of your,
of how right you were.

543
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,670
And then we rank order you one to 100.
That's Iq,

544
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:59,550
that's all there is to it.
So now people say Iq doesn't exist.

545
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,600
Well that's annoying because all they're
doing is gerrymandering.

546
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,540
The definition of the word exist,
you know,

547
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:11,650
because you can do that if you ask if a 
is equivalent to be.

548
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,080
The answer is it depends on what you 
mean by a and what you mean by being.

549
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:21,081
It's almost always a foolish question 
because you can take b and a and bend 

550
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:25,741
them and twist them in such a way that 
you could make one thing and another 

551
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:28,981
thing without too much problem.
People usually get around that by only 

552
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:30,280
using a word in a context,
right?

553
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:35,281
In a sentence or a phrase or a paragraph
that defines the word so that you can't 

554
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:37,510
weasel around like that.
But,

555
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,380
but more specifically in psychology,
we have methods to tell if something is 

556
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,230
real,
you know,

557
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:45,310
and psych ad.

558
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,370
If Iq doesn't pass the test of reality 
for a psychological measure,

559
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:56,610
then no other psychological measures 
passed the tests because they're 

560
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,770
validated exactly the same way I cue is.
And they don't work as well,

561
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,140
so you can say,
well no,

562
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,960
that's not real,
but then you have to throw out,

563
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:10,410
you probably have to throw out the 
social sciences completely in so far as 

564
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,831
they're actually sciences,
because the same statistics are used to 

565
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:14,980
generate their findings.
So you can't just say,

566
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:19,981
well,
this really powerful thing doesn't 

567
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,541
exist.
Well a bunch of these weak things exist 

568
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:21,541
and they're measured the same way.
You don't get to play that game.

569
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,320
So.
Okay.

570
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:24,460
So does it exist?
Well,

571
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:27,130
you can measure it,
you can measure it reliably.

572
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,740
So that's definitely something you know,
because you might say,

573
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,530
well there's your shadow exists.
Well,

574
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,620
generally speaking,
under normal conditions,

575
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,810
you condition your shadow relatively 
reliable,

576
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,410
you know,
does it exist?

577
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,980
Well it passes one test of existence.
You can't detect it with a number of 

578
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:49,040
senses.
You can't touch it,

579
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:51,370
for example.
But you know,

580
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,140
whether or not something exists is 
actually a rather tricky question,

581
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,430
but you can measure it and it's useful 
and that's not a bad definition of,

582
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:10,810
of exist.
So what's it good for?

583
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,790
Well,
it predicts major life outcomes.

584
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,790
And importantly,
so,

585
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:24,930
and we,
we can talk about the power of 

586
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,651
intelligence momentarily.
If you were actually going to calculate 

587
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:32,621
an Iq score per se,
you would take the rank order that I 

588
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:36,080
just described and you would correct it 
for age because you know,

589
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:41,060
you can't really expect a seven year old
to know as much as a 15 year old or a 20

590
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,800
year old.
So generally speaking,

591
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:46,430
if you take a technical Iq test,
it will rank order you,

592
00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:50,180
but it'll only rank order you with 
people of the same age as you.

593
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,360
So that's just another,
you know,

594
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,460
it's an additional correction whether or
not that actually gives you a more 

595
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,730
accurate estimate of Iq is depends on 
what you mean by accurate.

596
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,120
A very bright seven year old generally 
doesn't know enough to do much useful in

597
00:34:08,251 --> 00:34:11,160
the way of work,
but they can learn extremely quickly.

598
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,150
And so,

599
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,600
um,

600
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,840
if you compared seven year olds to 
people of other ages purely in terms of 

601
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:25,301
their score on an Iq test,
there's a high probability that you 

602
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:26,060
would underestimate their speed of 
learning.

603
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,600
By the same token though,
by the time you're 40,

604
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,850
you have a lot of accumulated knowledge 
and so if,

605
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,820
if you only measured learning speed than
you would underestimate,

606
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,240
you would overestimate that seven year 
olds advantage over the 40 year old Iq 

607
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:50,530
is basically a unitary phenomenon,
but you can fractionated into.

608
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:57,050
It's a very,
very complicated for reasons that I'll 

609
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,720
tell you about in a minute.
If you had to divide Iq into two,

610
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,340
the way you would divide it would be 
into crystallized and fluid intelligence

611
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,700
and fluid intelligence would be roughly 
the ability to learn and crystallized.

612
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:13,550
Intelligence would be roughly a measure 
of how much you've learned.

613
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,260
Now those are separate to some degree,
and here's why.

614
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,930
They're separate.
As you age,

615
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,430
your capacity to learn decreases.
It's quite ugly,

616
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,710
so by the time you were about 24,
you're starting to get stupider from the

617
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:35,711
perspective of being able to learn,
and that's just pretty much a linear 

618
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:36,740
trip downhill until you depart the 
world.

619
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,980
So it's,
it's,

620
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,700
it's nasty to see because it's quite a 
steep degeneration.

621
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,910
You can stave that off by the way with 
cardiovascular and cardiovascular 

622
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:52,041
exercise and weightlifting,
so that's the best way to keep your 

623
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:54,180
learning capacity attack.
It's not to do cognitive exercises,

624
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,060
instituting physical exercise,
and then as you age,

625
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:02,190
then the amount you know goes up and 
what happens is those two things are 

626
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,970
actually tend to average out.
So now you might say,

627
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:07,500
well,
if I'm claiming that Iq,

628
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:12,501
is this a unitary thing,
how can I make the claim that you can 

629
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:15,831
divide it into two elements and that 
those elements are in some sense 

630
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,580
separate and I think the reason is for 
this.

631
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,880
So your,
your prefrontal Cortex,

632
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:26,210
roughly speaking,
so that's the part of your brain here 

633
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:26,670
forward.
You can think about in part,

634
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,490
it's the part that does the programming 
of motor activity,

635
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:34,491
voluntary motor activity,
but it also seems to be so let's say 

636
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:38,310
you're doing something new and you're 
pretty clunky and awkward at it and then

637
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:43,311
you do it more and more and you get 
smoother and smoother and smoother out 

638
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:43,311
it.
And what you tell them,

639
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:48,010
what happens is you're using your 
prefrontal cortex and to some degree 

640
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,670
your whole right hemisphere when you're 
first doing it,

641
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,680
and then as you get better and better at
it,

642
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,410
the ability shifts to the left and then 
it goes backwards.

643
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,850
So what's happening to some degree is 
your prefrontal cortex is programming 

644
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:06,030
the rest of your brain and you could 
think of fluid intelligence as a measure

645
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:11,031
of the ability of your,
of your brain to program itself and 

646
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:16,551
crystallized ability as a measure of how
much programming is there and then so 

647
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:19,920
they're separate in that manner because 
they performed separate functions.

648
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,820
But then you can also understand that 
the better your programmer is,

649
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,980
the better the programming is going to 
be.

650
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:30,981
So that inflates the correlation.
And so you can have two separate things 

651
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:34,680
functional functionally that are even 
dissociable in terms of age,

652
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:36,870
but because they work so tightly 
together,

653
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,090
it's like how fast can you dig a hole 
and how big is the pile of dirt?

654
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,280
Well,
obviously those two things are different

655
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:49,281
in some important sense,
but they're going to be highly 

656
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:49,281
correlated because the faster you can 
take a whole,

657
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:52,740
the bigger the pile of dirt and so.
So anyways,

658
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:57,420
crystallized intelligence is often also 
often measured as verbal intelligence,

659
00:37:57,421 --> 00:38:01,590
but the better measure fundamentally is 
crystallized intelligence.

660
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:09,470
Now you know how we looked at the I 
personality hierarchy,

661
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:14,961
right?
That was this and what you see is three 

662
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:20,550
strata roughly speaking aspect,
trait super factor,

663
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:26,390
and it looks like the super factors.
I would say the validity of those super 

664
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:32,331
factors is not yet clear.
You can get a lot of useful prediction 

665
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:35,260
by looking at the traits and there's 
more and more evidence.

666
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:38,170
There's about 400 studies now using the 
aspects.

667
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:43,830
There's more and more evidence that you 
can also derive additional useful 

668
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,950
predictive validity from differentiating
the,

669
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,530
the personality down to the,
you know,

670
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,800
to the,
to the aspect level.

671
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,770
So that's the highest resolution 
personality model we have.

672
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,060
There are people who claim that there's 
something at the apex which you might 

673
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,500
call good personality,
but I don't think so.

674
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:04,720
I think it's.
I don't think so.

675
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,190
You'd have to read the literature to 
understand the,

676
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,080
the dispute.
It's a statistical dispute roughly 

677
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,080
speaking,
but um,

678
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:18,180
we've found in our research that 
stability and plasticity early 

679
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,280
correlated at point two,
they're pretty separate.

680
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,520
So I'm going to stick with that for now 
even though it might be wrong.

681
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,370
What?

682
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,960
Okay.
So

683
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:57,410
can you explain this properly?

684
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:11,230
If you read the cognitive literature and
the neuropsychological literature,

685
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:17,070
you will find that neuro psychologists 
tend to assume that there are forms of 

686
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:23,791
cognitive ability that you cannot 
describe as Iq and they make that claim 

687
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:30,161
because they'll take a test and they'll,
they'll use the test to measure 

688
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,960
something and then no correlate that 
with Iq.

689
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,200
And the correlation will only be about 
point two or point three.

690
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,520
And so they'll say,
well,

691
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:41,521
that's not a high enough correlation to 
justify saying that those things are 

692
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:46,681
identical because the correlation should
be more like point eight for them to be 

693
00:40:46,681 --> 00:40:47,230
identical.
But the problem is,

694
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,950
let's say I had a measure of your Iq,
your Iq and your Iq,

695
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:56,220
your Iq.
And then I asked you two questions and 

696
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,911
you and you and you and I summed your 
answers whether they were correct or 

697
00:40:59,911 --> 00:41:02,560
incorrect.
Now what would happen is there'd be some

698
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:07,060
correlation between your total score on 
those two questions and your overall Iq.

699
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,380
Maybe it would be point three,
but that wouldn't justify me in planning

700
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:17,270
that the two question Iq test is 
different than the full scale Iq test.

701
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,830
It's just worse

702
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,940
and you're going to run into this 
problem when you read psychological 

703
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,931
literature and if you ever do it,
do any research because it's very 

704
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:31,040
difficult to determine whether you get 
what's called discriminant validity,

705
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:36,041
which is this thing measures this,
this thing measures this thing and 

706
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:40,181
they're actually different or whether 
you just have a lousy measure of this 

707
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:41,990
and allows you measure of this.
And so the correlation is low.

708
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:47,830
Now here's a neuropsychological test and
you could make the case that this is 

709
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,750
measuring something different than Iq.
So imagine you see an array of 12 

710
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,440
pictures.
They're just drawings,

711
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,140
drawings of a telephone and a boot and a
chair.

712
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,700
Just common objects.
Okay?

713
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:09,701
So you see 12 of them.
And then you have to click one and then 

714
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:13,400
when you do that they move and then the 
next time you have to click one,

715
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:18,401
you haven't already clicked and then 
they move again and you click and they 

716
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:21,860
move again and you click and you see by 
the time you get to about eight of them,

717
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,100
you're starting to run into trouble 
because it's difficult to remember more 

718
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,590
than eight abstraction simultaneously.
Seven actually in some people claim it's

719
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:33,800
as low as four.
That's the capacity of working memory,

720
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,000
which is why we kind of like phone 
numbers to be seven digits long.

721
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,790
A lot of the things we want to just 
remember r s r seven,

722
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:46,260
you long.
And if we want to remember more than 

723
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:46,260
that,
we chunk.

724
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,290
Although you know,
if I show you some dots,

725
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:50,860
okay,

726
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,800
say,
well how many dogs?

727
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:54,630
Three.
You don't have to count them.

728
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,520
You can see three dogs.

729
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,980
You can see for dogs,
it's not obvious that you can see five 

730
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,390
dots at that point.
You start to go three and two.

731
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,080
And then if there are six dots,
well that's how they would be arranged 

732
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,620
on a dice dice,
right?

733
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:20,621
The reason they'd be reached on the dice
that way is because you could see two 

734
00:43:20,621 --> 00:43:20,690
sets of three and for six,
you know,

735
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:25,100
if there are sort of randomly dispersed 
like that,

736
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,380
I say,
well how many dots is that one?

737
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:32,381
You have character.
And what that shows you is that your 

738
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:36,101
working memory,
which is really a function of fluid 

739
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:36,101
intelligence,
is a very,

740
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:37,880
very narrow thing.
And it's like your vision.

741
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,890
You know,
remember we saw the gorilla video,

742
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:41,990
right?
Then you can only pick up the thing that

743
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:43,760
you're attending to.
Well,

744
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,070
working memories like that,
it's this narrow,

745
00:43:46,071 --> 00:43:50,930
narrow form of attention and it,
it sort of specifies unitary phenomenon.

746
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,360
I mean that's not quite unitary,
but it's close enough.

747
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,280
And I think the reason that it does 
that,

748
00:43:55,281 --> 00:44:00,281
it's like why is your attention so 
narrow is because often what you're 

749
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:02,750
trying to do as you work in the world is
to make binary choices.

750
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,500
You know,
you don't want to choose between 20 

751
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,121
things you want to read.
You want to choose between two things 

752
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:10,730
because then when you choose between two
things,

753
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,850
you can actually act if it's still two 
things can't act.

754
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:18,851
If it's one thing you could act.
So imagine you go into Chinese 

755
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:22,151
restaurant is a good example because 
Chinese restaurants virtually always 

756
00:44:22,151 --> 00:44:24,530
have like 400 items on the menu and you 
might ask yourself,

757
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:29,531
well,
how the hell do you figure out what you 

758
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:30,510
want and what you don't do is go through
every single menu item and,

759
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,180
and it because you'd be there for a 
week.

760
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,420
So what you seem to do is eradicate 
chunks.

761
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,750
So you might say,
well I'm not in the mood for anything 

762
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,420
but fish.
Okay Bang.

763
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,090
Three quarters of the menu disappears,
you know?

764
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:48,330
And then you might go,
well I don't want it brandon whack.

765
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:53,331
And then another half is gone and now 
you're down to maybe eight choices and 

766
00:44:53,331 --> 00:44:57,610
you know,
you reduce that to four and then two to 

767
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:57,610
perhaps,
well I'd like this or I'd like that.

768
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:02,480
But the waiter doesn't care about that.
The waiter wants to know which one you 

769
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,620
want because until it's reduced to one,
you don't get to act.

770
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,160
And so the reduction,
the reduced narrow strip that we use to 

771
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:14,160
perceive the world and partly is a 
consequence of processing inadequacy,

772
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:17,970
but it's also partly because we really 
are trying to reduce things all the time

773
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:19,470
to zero in one,
right?

774
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,550
Yes or no.

775
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,540
So okay,
so back to the this three stratum theory

776
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:29,541
of cognitive abilities.
Now you've got this array of 12 items 

777
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:37,221
and it keeps shifting and then what I 
could do is score you by the number of 

778
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:41,750
duplications you if you pick the same 
mind that more than once you lose a 

779
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:42,960
point.
So the maximum points you can get is 12.

780
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:47,961
And you know,
people usually make three or four 

781
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:50,451
mistakes.
And so I could take your score on that 

782
00:45:50,451 --> 00:45:53,121
test.
Maybe I'd give it to you two or three 

783
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:54,981
times just to make sure I have a 
reasonably stable indicator and then I 

784
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:56,160
can correlate it with your full scale 
fluid Iq.

785
00:45:56,161 --> 00:45:58,140
And I get a correlation of about point 
two,

786
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:00,090
five or point three.
Now,

787
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,000
if you don't know anything about 
psychometrics,

788
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:03,570
you'd say,
Oh,

789
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:08,571
well that's obviously measuring 
something different than full scale Iq 

790
00:46:08,571 --> 00:46:09,990
because it only correlates at point two,
five or point three,

791
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:14,991
but what it turns out is no,
it's more analogous to the problem that 

792
00:46:14,991 --> 00:46:18,081
we were just talking about where I asked
you three questions and tried to derive 

793
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:20,460
your entire icu from that.
It's just a bad measurement.

794
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,120
Now what happens is if you take the 
neuropsychological tests that people 

795
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,531
have developed that theoretically assess
the function of different parts of the 

796
00:46:30,531 --> 00:46:33,951
brain,
so and you factor in analyze them and 

797
00:46:33,951 --> 00:46:35,580
you extract out a single factor,
the single factor,

798
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:37,650
it looks exactly like fluid 
intelligence.

799
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:43,010
Now,
is it exactly the same as fluid 

800
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:43,010
intelligence?

801
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:50,370
It would be the onus would be on the 
person who claims it's not to 

802
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,571
demonstrate the difference.
We did give university students have a 

803
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:57,231
very extensive battery of prefrontal 
cortical tests and measured their Iq and

804
00:46:57,511 --> 00:47:02,511
then we used the prefrontal cortical 
test average and the ICU to predict 

805
00:47:02,671 --> 00:47:07,671
grades and what we did find was the 
prefrontal tests predicted over and 

806
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:11,241
above the eye Iq,
but we thought maybe if you don't,

807
00:47:12,641 --> 00:47:17,580
the prefrontal average and the ICU and 
you added them to to predict grade,

808
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:22,050
say that's a regression analysis.
They both added in so they predict.

809
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:25,140
They predicted different parts of the 
variation.

810
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:27,930
It added additional you necessarily 
information.

811
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:33,140
However,
if you took all the neuropsychological 

812
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,620
tests and all the individual Iq tests 
and you put them in one data set and 

813
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,840
then extracted out a single factor is 
that would be fluid intelligence roughly

814
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:41,350
speaking.

815
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:47,070
That predicted grades very well,
and then what was leftover didn't 

816
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:50,131
predict it all.
So what we concluded was that 

817
00:47:50,131 --> 00:47:52,090
neuropsychological tests,
prefrontal cortical tests,

818
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,260
test intelligence,
and they test a slightly different thing

819
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:02,010
than fluid intelligence tests do,
but that isn't because they're testing 

820
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,061
something different.
It's because fluid intelligence tests 

821
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:08,701
the way they're currently constituted 
don't sample the universe of potential 

822
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:14,551
questions as well as they should.
So it wasn't that we discovered 

823
00:48:14,551 --> 00:48:18,841
something different.
We discovered a measurement error 

824
00:48:18,841 --> 00:48:18,841
roughly speaking,
that only took five years.

825
00:48:18,841 --> 00:48:20,410
By the way,
it took five years to figure that out.

826
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,410
It was very annoying because when we 
started,

827
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,260
I was trying to predict grades,
you know,

828
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:31,261
and I didn't know the ICU literature 
very well at that point because 

829
00:48:31,261 --> 00:48:35,821
psychologist don't usually teach it very
much because Iq bothers the hell out of 

830
00:48:35,821 --> 00:48:40,531
everybody and so and the neuro 
psychologists who have their own field 

831
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,190
are,
you know,

832
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:47,220
they're motivated to make the claim that
they've discovered something new and I 

833
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:47,220
just took that on face value.

834
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,720
But then we tried to predict like,
okay,

835
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:54,721
if I'm going to predict how well you do 
at your job while I want to get a good 

836
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:55,780
cognitive measure,
because if it's a complex job,

837
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:00,810
because if it's a complex job,
it keeps changing and you have to learn 

838
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:01,390
to keep up and if you can't do that,
you're not going to do very well.

839
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:04,810
So that will be bad for you and it would
be bad for everyone around you.

840
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:10,620
And so we were trying to pick up 
additional information that would enable

841
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:16,740
that,
the accuracy of that prediction to be 

842
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,200
increased and looked at the neuro psych 
literature.

843
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:20,560
But at most it was an ambivalent 
success.

844
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,720
Okay.
So how does that relate to this?

845
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:27,900
Well,
at the bottom tier where it's the most 

846
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,990
differentiated,
you have single tests and there are only

847
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,680
correlated with each other at about 
point to maybe point three.

848
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:37,710
So you might say,
well they're all measuring different 

849
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:37,710
things.
They're not,

850
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,020
they're all measuring the same thing 
badly.

851
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:42,550
And then you might clump them.
So let's say I asked you,

852
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:47,940
Oh God,
maybe I give you a test that asks you 

853
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,170
tested your vocabulary with six letter 
words and then I gave you another test 

854
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:53,830
that tested you vocabulary with seven 
letter words and another one that tested

855
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:56,230
your vocabulary with eight letter words.
And I said,

856
00:49:56,231 --> 00:49:57,760
well,
those are all different tests.

857
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,700
While they would correlate quite highly,
not perfectly,

858
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:04,900
but I can clump them together and make 
one sort of super test out at them.

859
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:09,901
And then I could take super test a and 
super testy and super test B C and look 

860
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:13,810
at the correlations between those and 
those would climb to about point five or

861
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:18,811
point six.
And then if I clump the super tests 

862
00:50:18,811 --> 00:50:21,661
together,
which would be happening by the time we 

863
00:50:21,661 --> 00:50:23,761
got to stratum to there,
then the correlation between the tests 

864
00:50:23,761 --> 00:50:24,790
would start to rise to the bug point 
seven.

865
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,550
And then if I collapsed all the super 
tests into a single measure,

866
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:34,020
then the correlation between any of 
those stratum to tests and g because 

867
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,890
that would be the highest level thing.
G is general intelligence.

868
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,080
That's roughly speaking.
Fluid intelligence.

869
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:44,300
The correlation between any of the super
tests and g would be about point eight.

870
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:50,350
So the point of all this,
there's no way of discussing this sort 

871
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:54,911
of thing without doing it statistically 
and technically because are statistical 

872
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:56,350
and technical processes.
So what happens is,

873
00:50:56,351 --> 00:51:01,310
is that now let's say now you have a 
measure of fluid intelligence.

874
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,760
Okay,
you've got this measure and you take one

875
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:09,761
of the stratum two sets of tests and you
use both to predict academic 

876
00:51:09,761 --> 00:51:14,140
achievement.
What happens is that the super factor g 

877
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,730
kills the rest of them.
You're just not going to be able to find

878
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:22,180
any of the tests in the bottom strata 
that are going to add to the prediction 

879
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,140
of what the general factor can give you.

880
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,950
Now with with with personality,
that's just not the case.

881
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:33,010
You can't pull out a single factor that 
predicts how personality is going to 

882
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:33,950
influence jobs.
You know,

883
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,820
performance across your life.
If you add neuroticism,

884
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:42,170
if you take the single factor and you 
add neuroticism,

885
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,420
neuroticism is going to kick the single 
factor out.

886
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:49,421
Conscientiousness is gonna,
kick the single factor out and so forth 

887
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:50,510
because there isn't a single factor.
It's not.

888
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,960
The tests aren't highly correlated 
enough to say that they're all measuring

889
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:58,961
the same thing to some degree.
The personality traits really are 

890
00:51:58,961 --> 00:52:02,051
different.
You know you can clump them into 

891
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:02,051
plasticity,
instability,

892
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:02,051
but even there,
your loot you,

893
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:07,020
you're maintaining a lot of validity.
So if I took stability and then he used 

894
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:10,100
conscientiousness to predict job 
performance,

895
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:12,170
conscientiousness would white boats 
stability,

896
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:14,240
it'd be a better measure,
but you never get that.

897
00:52:14,241 --> 00:52:17,660
You virtually never get that with the 
lower tests in the ICU straddle.

898
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,520
Okay,
now,

899
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,190
yeah.
Well I just talked to you about that.

900
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,150
So that's,
that's a.

901
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,360
that's a good representation of how 
these things are associated.

902
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:34,361
So at the bottom you have the single 
tasks and then they chunk into say 

903
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:38,741
sequential reasoning,
quantitative reasoning and induction on 

904
00:52:38,741 --> 00:52:42,101
the fluid intelligence size side and 
general knowledge and language 

905
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:43,040
development.
On the crystallized intelligence side,

906
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:47,270
that's the red.
And then they're all subsumed underneath

907
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:52,990
fluid intelligence,
which is the measure that you really 

908
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:52,990
want to have.
Okay?

909
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:55,100
So what good is that?

910
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:02,550
Well,
it basically correlates point five with 

911
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,100
major life outcomes and that's 25 
percent of the variance and maybe you 

912
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:10,801
can get into a bit higher than that,
but it will just stick with point five 

913
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:11,560
as a,
as a representation.

914
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:13,900
And so let's say,

915
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:21,850
let's say you take a bunch of students,
100 of them,

916
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,600
and you want to sort them into those who
will pass a class with a 50 percent 

917
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,950
failure rate.
Okay?

918
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,080
So you just pick them randomly.
You're going to pass,

919
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:32,190
you're going to fail,
you're going to pass,

920
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:34,380
you're gonna fail.
So that's no knowledge.

921
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,060
I have no predictive dominance 
whatsoever,

922
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:41,061
so my validity,
the validity of my classification is 

923
00:53:41,061 --> 00:53:42,420
basically going to be equivalent chat,
zero,

924
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:47,770
right?
I'm only going to have a 50 percent 

925
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:47,770
chance of picking who passes and who 
fails.

926
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:52,700
If I used Iq,
if I had all your Iq scores and I did 

927
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,410
the prediction,
I get right 75 percent of the time,

928
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:01,550
so it's a huge difference.
It cuts the failure rate in half by 

929
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:05,331
using ICU and ICU is a very good 
predictor of health and it's a predictor

930
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:10,851
of longevity.
It's a predictor of resistance to 

931
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:10,851
posttraumatic stress disorder.

932
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:13,620
It's a predictor of obviously 
occupational status.

933
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:17,880
It's a predictor of educational success.
It's a predictor of income,

934
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,600
it's very powerful predictor,
and here's another way of 

935
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:28,941
conceptualizing its effect.
So imagine that you could choose how you

936
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:34,281
were going to be when you were born,
and this is in North America because 

937
00:54:34,281 --> 00:54:35,280
it's gonna vary by society at least to 
some degree.

938
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,740
You get to be born into a family that's 
at the 95th percentile for wealth,

939
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,040
or you get to be born at the 95th 
percentile for intelligence who's better

940
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:51,081
off at the age of 40.
And the answer is the person who picks 

941
00:54:51,081 --> 00:54:54,510
being born with an Iq in the 95th 
percentile at birth,

942
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:57,030
it's more powerful predictor of longterm
life outcome.

943
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:59,580
Then familial wealth.
So,

944
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:07,190
and it shows up everywhere.
Like one of the things we did recently 

945
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:10,581
was looking at disgust sensitivity.
We're going to talk a little bit about 

946
00:55:10,581 --> 00:55:12,120
that when we talk about 
conscientiousness because orderly people

947
00:55:12,121 --> 00:55:15,480
seem to be more sensitive to discuss the
disorderly people.

948
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:20,750
That seems to be why they're ordering.
But the higher you are in Icu,

949
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:23,880
the less disgust sensitive you are.
Now,

950
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:26,580
we don't know exactly why that is.
Maybe it's because,

951
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:31,850
you know,
maybe you could make the inference that 

952
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:34,761
Iq is,
is in related in some way to the 

953
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,840
physiological integrity of the Cortex,
you know,

954
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:40,290
rather than the limbic system,
which is the source of say,

955
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:42,640
emotions and motivations.
Um,

956
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:48,500
and the more powerful it is,
the more inhibitory capacity it has over

957
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:53,370
the more fundamental motivations and 
emotions you could make that case.

958
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,680
The problem is,
is that intelligent people don't 

959
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,370
necessarily seem to be any less 
impulsive,

960
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:05,150
so,
and you can have a pretty vicious 

961
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:08,721
personality disorder that's 
characterized by extremely disorganized 

962
00:56:08,721 --> 00:56:12,081
behavior and a complete inability to put
longterm plans into operation and still 

963
00:56:12,081 --> 00:56:16,881
have a high Iq.
So what are the things we really can't 

964
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:21,291
figure out?
It's just a hell of a thing to try to 

965
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:24,351
figure out is like the relationship 
between Iq and industriousness is zero 

966
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:30,510
and that just makes no sense to me 
because most of the brain models are 

967
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:34,651
predicated on the idea that your ability
to engage in longterm planning is the 

968
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,420
factor that's associated with 
intelligence.

969
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:42,220
But then industrious people seem to not 
only engage in longterm planning,

970
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:44,860
they seem to do it right so that if 
there are more industrious,

971
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:47,770
they put their plans into operation then
the plans that actually work,

972
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,480
but it's not correlated with Iq.
So then I can't figure out,

973
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:57,481
well obviously the industrious person in
some ways able to regulate their own 

974
00:56:57,481 --> 00:56:59,620
behavior.
They're not procrastinating,

975
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:02,950
for example.
And you'd think that that the ability to

976
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:06,520
not procrastinate would be a cognitive 
feature,

977
00:57:06,521 --> 00:57:11,521
but it doesn't seem to be and we have no
idea what makes people industrious and 

978
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:15,121
we can't figure it out.
So it's this incredibly potent 

979
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:18,151
predictor.
It's just about as powerful as ICU and 

980
00:57:18,151 --> 00:57:20,230
we have no idea what it is.
So.

981
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:26,670
So if you think,
if you have a smart idea about that and 

982
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:29,911
you want to pursue it,
like feel free because there's a big 

983
00:57:29,911 --> 00:57:32,190
mystery there that no one's been able to
crack and we'd been added for a long 

984
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,610
time and have had almost no success.

985
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:38,690
You know,
we had people do things like give them 

986
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,041
sentences of ends,
ams and use sort of randomly distributed

987
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:42,820
and then we'd have them count the use,
you know,

988
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:47,821
like a whole page of sentences.
They're not census or just strings of 

989
00:57:47,821 --> 00:57:49,420
letter county use.
How useless,

990
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:54,421
you know,
you'd think that someone industrious 

991
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:54,421
would do that better.
It's like they don't.

992
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:59,410
That's an Iq test that people who can 
count the use faster have hierarchies,

993
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:04,500
almost everything that you would do that
would where it has to do with 

994
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,550
manipulation of abstractions of any 
sort.

995
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:10,390
Even something that basic seems to be 
fundamentally associated with Iq.

996
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:13,990
People with higher iqs have slightly 
bigger heads.

997
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:17,350
If you control for body size,
they have slightly bigger brains.

998
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,440
If you control for body size,
the axons on their neurons are a bit 

999
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,641
thicker so that the electrical messages 
seem to travel a little bit more 

1000
00:58:26,641 --> 00:58:27,250
efficiency efficiently.

1001
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:30,640
They are slightly faster in simple 
reflex test,

1002
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:34,480
so it goes right down to the level of.
Because they're simple reflex light goes

1003
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:39,481
on pushing buttons.
There's not many neurons mediating that 

1004
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:39,481
response,
you know,

1005
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:41,410
chains of neurons.
There's only a few neurons communicating

1006
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:46,411
so that you can do that,
but even at that relatively simple 

1007
00:58:46,411 --> 00:58:48,670
processing level,
Iq is associated with speed,

1008
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:53,671
so there's a physiological component.
You're less likely to develop 

1009
00:58:53,671 --> 00:58:54,100
Alzheimer's disease if you have a high 
Iq,

1010
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,100
and maybe that's because your brain is 
just more robust,

1011
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,710
you know,
so you could sustain damage,

1012
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:03,220
say up to 50 percent of your brain,
you wouldn't even show it if you're,

1013
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:06,550
if you have a sufficiently high Iq.
Whereas if you're,

1014
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:11,650
you know,
if you're on the bottom end of the ICU 

1015
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:11,650
distribution,
you're much more,

1016
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,660
you seem to be much more susceptible to 
physiological damage.

1017
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:19,130
Um,
nutrition is a big predictor of Iq 

1018
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:19,130
variation.
So,

1019
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,920
and a lot of that's been hammered out of
modern,

1020
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,380
you know,
so 150 years ago,

1021
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:29,770
people's Iq was pretty tightly 
associated with their nutritional 

1022
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:29,770
status,
but now,

1023
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,250
you know,
they're very few people in North America

1024
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,280
who don't have enough to eat even though
there's some variation in quality of 

1025
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,460
diet and that's flattened out a lot of 
the,

1026
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:42,500
uh,
cultural variability and intelligence.

1027
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,930
Okay.
So this is a,

1028
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,950
um,
this guy named Hemphill,

1029
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:54,470
did this paper read American 
psychologist a while back,

1030
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:56,480
and one of the things he was interested 
in doing,

1031
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:58,490
remember we talked about effect sizes,
right?

1032
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,750
How big is an effect in psychology or 
the social sciences in general?

1033
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,320
And people have used rules of thumb that
point five was a moderate effect and 

1034
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:09,870
point three was a,
you know,

1035
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,110
a minimal effect.
And point two was,

1036
01:00:12,111 --> 01:00:13,120
uh,
you know,

1037
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,340
starting to diminish to the point of non
utility,

1038
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:21,820
but what handheld did instead of 
guessing because that was just a guess 

1039
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,770
was actually go and look at papers that 
were published in psychology to see what

1040
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:28,970
effect sizes are being reported.
So it's an empirical analysis of how big

1041
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:33,410
the effects that psychologists and other
social scientists report.

1042
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,780
And so what he found was that,

1043
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,100
um,

1044
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:41,860
the highest third of papers.
So the,

1045
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:46,950
the third of papers that had the biggest
effects reported effects from point 

1046
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:46,950
three.
Five,

1047
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:46,950
two point seven,
eight.

1048
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,790
I'm the middle third from point two,
one point three,

1049
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:52,280
three,
and the lower third from point.

1050
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,490
Oh,
to two point two.

1051
01:00:53,491 --> 01:00:56,010
One.
So is there another?

1052
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:59,190
Yeah.
If you look on the left side here,

1053
01:00:59,191 --> 01:01:03,450
you see that and are lasted point one 
five,

1054
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:09,550
characterize as the first quarter of 
published studies and R of point one,

1055
01:01:09,631 --> 01:01:10,560
five,
two point three,

1056
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:12,780
five,
the next core tile,

1057
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:18,140
so 50 percent of psychological studies 
report and are of less than point three,

1058
01:01:18,181 --> 01:01:23,181
five 90 percent report and are of less 
than point five and only 78 percent 

1059
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:32,560
reported our point five or above.
So what that means is that the 

1060
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,991
relationship between Iq and say academic
performance or longterm life income is 

1061
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:43,490
higher than that reported in all but 
about five percent of psychology 

1062
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:45,780
studies.
Okay.

1063
01:01:45,781 --> 01:01:48,090
So here's an interesting.
You might say,

1064
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:49,520
again,

1065
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,060
in order to determine whether something 
exists,

1066
01:01:54,061 --> 01:01:56,490
you have to be able to measure it and 
then it has to be good for something.

1067
01:01:56,491 --> 01:02:01,491
So it has to be grippable and has to be 
usable as a tool will save for,

1068
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:07,010
for the sake of argument,
what sort of Iq do you need for what 

1069
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:07,600
kind of job?
Um,

1070
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:12,950
this was derived from a company called 
wonderlic and wonderlic does employment 

1071
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:17,301
testing.
Psychologists usually don't use the 

1072
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:17,400
wonderlic test.
It's a relatively short Iq test and it's

1073
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:22,401
a good test,
I think don't use it because it was 

1074
01:02:22,401 --> 01:02:25,401
developed commercially,
but we tested the wonderlic out a lot 

1075
01:02:25,401 --> 01:02:25,710
and it has excellent psychometric 
properties.

1076
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:30,711
It's a very good Iq testing.
Probably airs a little bit in testing 

1077
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:36,951
crystallized Iq rather than fluid Iq,
but we won't argue about that for the 

1078
01:02:36,951 --> 01:02:38,220
time being.
All right,

1079
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:43,221
so if you have an Iq from 130,
116 to 130,

1080
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:47,100
that puts you in the [inaudible] 86 to 
95th percentile.

1081
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:50,010
Right?
So that means you're minimally.

1082
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:52,350
If there were eight people in a room on 
average,

1083
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:53,580
you'd be the smartest person.

1084
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:54,540
Okay.

1085
01:02:56,350 --> 01:02:58,180
I should tell you,
just so you know that

1086
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:05,450
if you're a state college students,
we use the US as an example because 

1087
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:09,831
there's more differentiation between the
American universities in terms of 

1088
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:10,500
quality.
Then there is the Canadian universities,

1089
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:17,030
if you're in a.
If you're in an average American 

1090
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,720
postsecondary institution,
your Iq is 115,

1091
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:23,460
and so you know,
you think that's not all that bright,

1092
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,480
but that's brighter than seven out of 
eight people in the general population,

1093
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:36,590
and so there are as many people.
If you look at the North American 

1094
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:39,951
distribution,
so we have the 50th percentile in the 

1095
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,960
middle of the normal distribution.
You have the 85th percentile here and 

1096
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,791
you have the 15th percentile here.
It's about 70 percent of people fall 

1097
01:03:46,791 --> 01:03:50,781
between the 15th and the 85th percentile
or right at the 50th percentile.

1098
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,860
You're not really very literate,
and so what that means is that in the 

1099
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:00,980
United States there's just as many 
people who aren't literate as there are 

1100
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:04,341
people who are in college and what I 
would mean by literate is not so much 

1101
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:08,850
like here's a bare bones definition of 
literate.

1102
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:14,310
You could follow written instructions 
and so what that means is it's kind of a

1103
01:04:14,311 --> 01:04:15,960
twofold issue,
right?

1104
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:20,961
You can,
you can make out the words and the 

1105
01:04:20,961 --> 01:04:22,671
phrases and the sentences,
but then you can translate them into 

1106
01:04:22,671 --> 01:04:26,931
actual action.
You can use them as information and an 

1107
01:04:26,931 --> 01:04:27,690
85 you're going to have not a very good 
time doing that,

1108
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:33,440
and so when you're wondering things 
about the way society is structured and 

1109
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,421
white people are not,
don't necessarily make the most 

1110
01:04:38,431 --> 01:04:43,431
intellectually sophisticated choices.
One thing that's very much worth 

1111
01:04:43,431 --> 01:04:47,181
remembering is that there's just as many
people who are functionally illiterate 

1112
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:47,910
in North America as there are people who
are in,

1113
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:50,760
you know,
tier one colleges.

1114
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:52,980
It's quite shocking.
Anyways.

1115
01:04:52,981 --> 01:04:54,630
Okay,
so you want to be an attorney,

1116
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:57,570
a research analyst and editor and 
advertising manager,

1117
01:04:57,571 --> 01:04:58,920
a chemist,
an engineer,

1118
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,950
and executive assistance analyst and 
auditor.

1119
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,380
So you're up in the professional levels 
there.

1120
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:10,400
You need an ICU of at least 116 and so 
130 would be better.

1121
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,570
My suspicions are that the average Iq of
people in this room is about 1:20

1122
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:19,090
to 1:25.
It might be a little higher than that.

1123
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:24,420
It's hard to measure Iq in the ute 
population because a lot of people have 

1124
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,020
English as a second language and so that
makes it harder to,

1125
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:31,410
you know,
it's harder to measure crystallized 

1126
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,271
intelligence,
obviously using an English language 

1127
01:05:33,271 --> 01:05:35,401
test,
but that's we found when we've done our 

1128
01:05:35,401 --> 01:05:37,560
studies at the uft that the average 
exceeds 1:20,

1129
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,920
so you know,
so you guys have the cognitive power to 

1130
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,410
basically pursue professional level 
careers,

1131
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:47,740
um,
from 1:10

1132
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:50,720
to 1:15
manager,

1133
01:05:50,721 --> 01:05:52,750
supervisor,
programmer,

1134
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,490
teacher,
general manager,

1135
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:59,910
purchasing agent,
registered nurse sales account 

1136
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:02,401
executive.
These are actually empirically derived 

1137
01:06:02,401 --> 01:06:05,070
by the way.
So the wonderlic company has tested a 

1138
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:07,860
very large number of people.
And so these are the actual averages of 

1139
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,700
the professions that they are 
describing.

1140
01:06:09,701 --> 01:06:10,960
It's not hypothetical

1141
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,620
108 to 100,
three to 108.

1142
01:06:22,621 --> 01:06:25,770
So that's the 60 to the 70th percentile 
clerk,

1143
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,470
customer service Rep,
computer operator,

1144
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:31,170
medical debt collector secretary,
accounting clerk,

1145
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,350
general sales,
telephone sales assistant manager,

1146
01:06:34,351 --> 01:06:35,610
credit clerk,
drafter,

1147
01:06:35,611 --> 01:06:36,810
designer,
bookkeeper.

1148
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:42,470
There's a lot of white color,
like low level entry level white collar 

1149
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:47,301
jobs in that particular category.
So that would be the brighter people 

1150
01:06:48,841 --> 01:06:52,080
among the high school students who 
didn't go to college.

1151
01:06:52,081 --> 01:06:57,081
And University Iq,
this is dead average 50th to the 55th 

1152
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:58,860
percentile.
Police officer,

1153
01:06:58,861 --> 01:07:00,330
receptionist,
cashier,

1154
01:07:00,331 --> 01:07:03,300
general clerical staff inside sales 
clerk,

1155
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,850
meter reader,
printer teller,

1156
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,400
data entry,
electrical helper,

1157
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:10,500
dispatcher,
and general office.

1158
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:15,501
So that's right at 195 to 98.
So that's the 42nd to the 45th 

1159
01:07:16,801 --> 01:07:19,590
percentile.
Quality Control Checker,

1160
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:22,440
claims clerk,
security guard or unskilled labor.

1161
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:25,710
So look,
the unskilled laborers are up at 95th to

1162
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:26,580
98.
Right?

1163
01:07:26,581 --> 01:07:31,581
So that's,
you're still at the unskilled labor 

1164
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:35,391
level.
You're still have an Iq that's higher 

1165
01:07:35,391 --> 01:07:35,391
than 40 percent of the population.

1166
01:07:35,391 --> 01:07:37,350
Arc Welder,
diasend or mechanic medical,

1167
01:07:37,351 --> 01:07:42,351
dental assistant Iq 87 to 93 messenger,
factory production worker Assembler,

1168
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:46,920
food service worker,
nurses aid,

1169
01:07:46,921 --> 01:07:48,180
warehouseman,
custodian,

1170
01:07:48,181 --> 01:07:50,790
janitor,
material handler and packer.

1171
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,770
Okay.
So now what you see happening,

1172
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:56,370
the difference that it looks to me like 
you can do job,

1173
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:01,520
you can conceptualize jobs most simply 
with a two by two matrix.

1174
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,720
Okay.
So there's managerial,

1175
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,010
administrative jobs and creative jobs.
That's the first one.

1176
01:08:08,011 --> 01:08:13,011
And then there's low complexity.
High complexity and so what you're 

1177
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:15,980
starting to fall into the 21st to the 30
percentile,

1178
01:08:15,981 --> 01:08:20,981
so that's still one person in three are 
low complexity managerial jobs and so 

1179
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:24,200
what I mean by that is that if you're in
a low complexity job,

1180
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:27,200
imagine you're responsible for 30 
things,

1181
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:31,400
but roughly speaking,
it's the same 30 things all the time and

1182
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:36,401
roughly speaking,
they have to be taken care of the same 

1183
01:08:36,401 --> 01:08:39,251
way each time.
So you have a finite domain of 

1184
01:08:39,251 --> 01:08:42,341
responsibility and you can master it and
Iq will predict how fast you master it.

1185
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,710
But once you master it will predict how 
well you do.

1186
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:49,640
What happens then in all likelihood is 
that conscientiousness starts to predict

1187
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:54,320
or maybe emotional stability starts to 
predict or some of the other personality

1188
01:08:54,321 --> 01:08:58,820
factors start to become more important.
So but at 87 to 93,

1189
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,370
you're down at the level of custodian 
and janitor.

1190
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:08,530
And then that's that and that's not so 
good because you have the bottom 15 to 

1191
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:14,710
20 percent of the population who aren't 
quite,

1192
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:18,980
who haven't,
who don't have cognitive ability at that

1193
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:23,981
level.
And so one of the things that you're 

1194
01:09:23,981 --> 01:09:25,721
going to hear a lot about as you get 
older is reasons for unemployment and 

1195
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:32,230
one of the prime reasons for 
unemployment in the future is 

1196
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:34,661
increasingly going to be that there is 
just nothing for someone of that level 

1197
01:09:34,661 --> 01:09:38,861
of intelligence to do.
And this is partly why people hate icu 

1198
01:09:38,861 --> 01:09:41,180
because you think that is a nasty,
nasty thing to conclude.

1199
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:45,800
Let me tell you a story.
So I had a client at one point who,

1200
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:50,801
I suspect he had a verbal Iq of about 85
and a nonverbal Iq that was lower.

1201
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,710
Um,
he had other psychological issues,

1202
01:09:54,711 --> 01:09:59,711
but,
but we'll just concentrate on that one 

1203
01:09:59,711 --> 01:09:59,711
for the time being.

1204
01:09:59,711 --> 01:10:04,190
And you know,
he had a hard time finding a job.

1205
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:06,710
He was socially anxious and that didn't 
help,

1206
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:09,350
but you know,
even if he could overcome that,

1207
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:14,830
it was very difficult for him to master 
the basic skills that were involved in 

1208
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:17,600
what you would consider even relatively 
straightforward tasks.

1209
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:20,630
So I spent a lot of time trying to find 
him a job,

1210
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,510
which is,
was insanely difficult.

1211
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,050
He went to the government first to get 
help and they told him to,

1212
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:32,890
you know,
type up his resume on a computer and 

1213
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:32,890
distributed.
It's like,

1214
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:36,400
well,
that wasn't very helpful because he 

1215
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:36,400
didn't know how to use a computer and he
wasn't gonna type up his damn resume and

1216
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:39,170
you know,
it was if you want to get a job,

1217
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,590
go out and do the things that it would 
take to get a job while yeah,

1218
01:10:42,591 --> 01:10:44,630
if you can do that then you don't have a
problem.

1219
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:48,140
And so the government agencies were 
completely useless,

1220
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:53,141
you know,
and they were staffed by people who 

1221
01:10:53,141 --> 01:10:53,141
would assume that if you didn't do what 
you were advised to,

1222
01:10:53,141 --> 01:10:57,821
that you just didn't want to have a job 
instead of ever thinking that maybe you 

1223
01:10:57,821 --> 01:10:58,610
couldn't do it.
It's not that easy to use a computer.

1224
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:04,780
So.
And then I tried to get him a volunteer 

1225
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:08,381
job.
Well you can bloody well forget about 

1226
01:11:08,381 --> 01:11:10,481
that because it's harder to get a 
volunteer job than it is to get a real 

1227
01:11:10,481 --> 01:11:10,910
job.
And the reason for that is that you have

1228
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:13,530
to step through a number of complex 
bureaucratic hoops,

1229
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:16,500
including having police check and you 
know,

1230
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:21,620
first of all,
that's intimidating as hell for people 

1231
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:21,620
even if they haven't done anything 
wrong.

1232
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:22,710
And second,
it's not that straightforward.

1233
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:27,740
You know,
it involves maneuvering through a 

1234
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,260
complicated bureaucracy.
And that's not the only step.

1235
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,900
There's all sorts of other steps.
So volunteer work,

1236
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:31,740
that's out,
man,

1237
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:34,110
that's,
that's just not gonna happen.

1238
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:38,790
Not generally speaking.
And then I found him a job helping a guy

1239
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:42,240
out.
You had a bicycle shop slash bookstore.

1240
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:47,440
It was kind of a strange combination,
but it was a government subsidized 

1241
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,210
temporary position.
And then he did a good job at it.

1242
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:48,630
He could,
he,

1243
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,790
he,
he was reshelving books and that sort of

1244
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:55,791
thing.
And so he was reliable and he could do 

1245
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:55,791
that.
But you know,

1246
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:56,850
the subsidy program ended in,
of course,

1247
01:11:56,851 --> 01:12:01,851
if you run a bike shop slash bookstore,
it's not like you have additional money 

1248
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:02,550
to hire someone because you know those 
are.

1249
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:06,270
That's a store that's just not going to 
be generating maybe any income,

1250
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:07,920
but certainly not enough to hire 
someone.

1251
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,920
So that fell apart.
Then I,

1252
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,190
I did a bunch of con.

1253
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:17,240
I did made a bunch of personal contacts 
with charity organizations to see if I 

1254
01:12:17,971 --> 01:12:21,240
can get them a volunteer position.
I finally got him a volunteer position,

1255
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,630
so.
And then I went with him to train him at

1256
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:27,120
the volunteer position and that was so 
enlightening.

1257
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:32,720
So what he had to do was he had a stack 
of pieces of paper here and then a stack

1258
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:40,011
of envelopes here.
And in principle the pieces of paper 

1259
01:12:40,011 --> 01:12:42,330
which were letters were in the same 
order as the envelopes work.

1260
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:46,230
And so what he had to do was fold the 
pieces of paper three times and stuff,

1261
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:51,231
the folded piece of paper into the 
envelope and then seal the envelope and 

1262
01:12:51,231 --> 01:12:54,531
then put it here.
But it was a bit more complicated than 

1263
01:12:54,531 --> 01:12:57,711
that because sometimes the letters were 
French and sometimes they were in 

1264
01:12:57,711 --> 01:13:01,821
English.
So what that meant was that he had to 

1265
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:04,270
watch and see that the French envelopes 
went into this stack and the English and

1266
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:05,670
envelopes went into that stock.

1267
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:07,710
So that's one degree of complexity,
right?

1268
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:13,310
But then it also turned out that those 
damn envelopes had to be run through an 

1269
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:14,730
automatic letter sorting machine.
Now you might think,

1270
01:13:14,731 --> 01:13:19,731
well that doesn't matter,
but it does matter because those things 

1271
01:13:19,731 --> 01:13:22,551
have very tightly defined tolerances.
And if you make a mistake,

1272
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:28,680
imagine you fold the piece of paper and 
the first time you fold it,

1273
01:13:28,681 --> 01:13:30,660
you made a mistake of an eighth of an 
inch.

1274
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:36,140
And then the next time you fold it,
you make another eighth of an inch 

1275
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,530
mistake.
That means your piece of papers now one 

1276
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:40,731
quarter inch out of true,
and then you stuff it in the envelope 

1277
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:43,320
and folded,
but you crinkled the envelope.

1278
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:47,850
And so then the envelope gets stuck in 
the automatic processing machines.

1279
01:13:47,851 --> 01:13:52,851
So I taught him probably 20 hours how to
fold this piece of paper into three and 

1280
01:13:55,170 --> 01:14:00,030
he was a bit shaky and he just didn't 
have the motor fine motor ability or the

1281
01:14:00,031 --> 01:14:02,730
cognitive ability to do that and then 
I'll end with this.

1282
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:09,170
When he finally couldn't do it anymore,
what happened was the letters came with 

1283
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:13,581
photographs attached to them and then he
had to fold the pieces of paper around 

1284
01:14:13,581 --> 01:14:17,791
the photographs in a way that didn't 
crumpled the photographs so that they 

1285
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:21,031
could still fit into the envelopes and 
each photo was stapled maybe half an 

1286
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:27,631
inch different per piece of paper.
So then he had to fold them properly 

1287
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:32,970
with a different folding technique for 
every piece of paper and he had to sort 

1288
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:36,511
them into French and English.
And then also if the envelopes and the 

1289
01:14:36,511 --> 01:14:37,390
papers ever gone out of sync,
which they did now.

1290
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:42,391
And then he had to figure out how to 
sort the envelopes and the pieces of 

1291
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:43,090
paper to make sure that they were 
matched with the proper.

1292
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:49,140
You know,
they were matched with the proper 

1293
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:49,140
envelope.
It's like,

1294
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:49,140
no,
that was the end of it.

1295
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:50,950
And so I'll tell you the rest of his 
story later.

1296
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:53,110
So anyways,
you know,

1297
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,190
there,
there is.

1298
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:56,980
The moral of the story is if you're 
smart,

1299
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,740
you're privileged and thank God,
make use of it.

1300
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:02,410
And if you're on the lower end of the 
ICU distribution,

1301
01:15:02,411 --> 01:15:04,660
man,
you've got one tough life ahead of you,

1302
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:08,020
has nothing to do with willingness to 
work or virtually nothing.

1303
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:11,350
And it's a good thing to know,
even though it's horrible.

1304
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:22,910
Entrepreneurial reframing.
