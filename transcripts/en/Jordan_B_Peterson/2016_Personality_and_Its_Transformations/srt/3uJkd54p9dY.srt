1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,450
All right,
welcome back.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,620
So the next four lectures are also 
oriented towards discussion of primarily

3
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:21,660
clinical theories of psychology and 
psychopathology.

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,180
We're going to talk about lines of 
thinking that in some ways run parallel 

5
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,831
to those analysts because the thinkers 
we're going to discuss now with a few 

6
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:39,540
small exceptions,
well all of them,

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,870
all of the thinkers we're going to 
discuss in the next four lectures were 

8
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,411
either influenced heavily by Freud,
human adler or were themselves thinkers 

9
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:56,001
who influenced Freud and young.
So there's an intellectual continuity 

10
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:04,130
stretching over with with people who are
deeply educated and who are very 

11
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,721
thoughtful.
There's intellectual continuity ideas 

12
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:11,270
stretching over exceptional spans of 
time and so it's exactly the sort of 

13
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:16,311
thing that you would.
That sort of relationship is exactly 

14
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:18,900
what you'd imagined.
Roger has had a variety of influences,

15
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:23,901
so let's say Freud and Jung and Adler,
but he was also very much influenced by 

16
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,290
it.
Phenomenological ideas and the 

17
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,941
phenomenologists were and are phenomenal
of brand philosophy and which I'll 

18
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:42,711
explain more deeply and the other 
primary domain of influence on Rogers 

19
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:47,691
was Christianity likely and then 
Christianity also via probably northern 

20
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,300
European culture as far as I can tell.

21
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,390
The reason I'm,
I'm talking specifically about 

22
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,630
Christianity in relationship to rogers 
is because as a young man,

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,960
he was a fundamentalist Christian and he
was a seminarian.

24
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:05,961
So we had.
He was quite oriented towards mainline 

25
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,970
Protestant Christianity,
but when he was in university,

26
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,550
he had a crisis of belief,
I suppose,

27
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,780
when he was even going to go to China as
a missionary at one point,

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,520
um,
but he had a crisis of belief in 

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:21,810
university because he'd also been 
scientifically trained.

30
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:26,811
His father was a farmer who used rather 
advanced farming techniques and so 

31
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,570
rogers was trained to think 
scientifically from a very young age and

32
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,930
he experienced the conflict between his 
religious belief and his scientific 

33
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,411
presuppositions quite intensely.
And in that battle is formal Christian 

34
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:42,780
belief was the loser.
However,

35
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,250
his thinking is very much influenced by 
fundamentalist Protestant 

36
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,080
presuppositions and

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,440
the effect of those all described as we 
walked through Roger's thinking.

38
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:03,810
Now,
it's important to understand the 

39
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,831
philosophical underpinnings of a global 
personality or psychology theory because

40
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,490
every theory is set within a set of 
assumptions,

41
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,970
things that you have to assume to be 
true in order to proceed with the 

42
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,070
theory.
I like the axioms in,

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,680
in,
uh,

44
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,090
in classical geometry.
You can't prove the axioms.

45
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,460
You have to accept them.
Once you accept the axioms,

46
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,800
then you can move forward and use the 
whole system.

47
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,070
I think the reason that systems have to 
have axioms which are elements of belief

48
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:41,320
is because every system is incomplete,
right?

49
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:45,940
It doesn't cover the entire world.
And so in some sense,

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,510
you need a place to dispense with your 
ignorance.

51
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,580
And the way you do that is by making 
assumptions.

52
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:56,581
We're going to act as if the following 
is true and then you can proceed with a 

53
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,650
partial theory and you'll have some 
success with it,

54
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,410
but it's useful to understand the 
presuppositions because they'd orientate

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,440
new properly towards the theory.
Now Rogers is a phenomenologist and 

56
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:15,901
phenomenology is a brand of philosophy 
which I believe started with Edmund 

57
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,940
Husserl,
but was probably made most influential 

58
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,470
by his student,
Martin Heidegger.

59
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,210
Now heidegger

60
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,440
was,
there was a philosopher,

61
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:34,441
I suppose somewhat like Nicha and that 
he was very much his thinking around,

62
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:38,590
very much counter to what you might 
describe as general academic philosophy.

63
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,300
For example,
heidegger believe that ever since the 

64
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,021
time of Plato,
which is when people think philosophy 

65
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,070
began,
more or less western philosophy,

66
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:56,071
had taken up an erroneous direction.
It had become too concerned with the 

67
00:04:56,471 --> 00:05:01,471
nature of structures of thought and not 
concerned enough about the nature of 

68
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,350
being and so you can determine those two
things being as how things are and 

69
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,010
thought of course is how you represent 
things,

70
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,970
and one of heidegger's missions was to 
reestablish being as the central reality

71
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,630
of philosophy.
Now,

72
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,870
that begs the question,
which is what is being well to 

73
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:36,061
conceptualize reality as being is not to
conceptualize it the same way that you 

74
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,660
conceptualize it

75
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,500
in terms of modern Western thought.
Because one of the presuppositions at 

76
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:52,801
the basis of modern Western thought is 
that the most intelligent way to divide 

77
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:59,101
up the world is in terms of and 
objective experience or subjective and 

78
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,840
subjective experience and object of 
world.

79
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,320
So the fundamental scientific 
presupposition you might say is that 

80
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,290
there is an objective world.
It's the real thing.

81
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,340
You come to that by performing certain 
procedures,

82
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:20,000
documenting them,
describing now of those procedures,

83
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,580
documenting them,
and then allowing other people to do the

84
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:27,581
same thing,
operating under the presupposition that 

85
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:29,870
if they experience the same outcome from
the procedures,

86
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,200
then what they're experiencing is real.
That's basically the scientific method,

87
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,330
right?
Method results,

88
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,550
your detailed the method,
which is how you act on the world.

89
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:42,551
You get the results,
you compare them maybe across multiple 

90
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:45,941
observations that you do,
and then other people do multiple 

91
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:47,030
observations.
You come up with that with a consensus,

92
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,390
but it's a method bound consensus and 
then of course you abstract out general 

93
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,570
principles from that works very 
powerfully,

94
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,070
right?
Make no mistake about it.

95
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,670
The objective,
the idea that there is an objective 

96
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,030
external world and that that's the best 
way to conceptualize reality is an 

97
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,730
unbelievably powerful tool.

98
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Now,
whether or not it's an accurate 

99
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,361
description of reality,
that's a much more difficult question 

100
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,230
and it's partly a matter of definition 
actually,

101
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,430
you know,
it's the case that there are different 

102
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,430
forms of geometry.
You might know this,

103
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,451
you can start from the presupposition 
that reality has a three dimensional 

104
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:31,060
structure and then you're basically 
within the realm of Euclidean geometry,

105
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:34,550
but you can also start with the 
presupposition that reality has afforded

106
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:39,551
emotional structure and that kind of 
geometry was invented in the late 18 

107
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:43,681
hundreds and it turned out to be the 
perfect geometry to describe the 

108
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:46,531
universe that Einstein conceptualized 
when he came up with his great theories 

109
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:50,671
in,
in the second decade of the 20th 

110
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,971
century.
So it's interesting because you could 

111
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:56,371
start from different assumptions,
build tools on the basis of those 

112
00:07:56,371 --> 00:08:00,241
assumptions,
and sometimes you find out that those 

113
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:00,241
tools work very well.
Indeed.

114
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,970
Now it's not that easy to think of flaws
in the subjective experience.

115
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,170
Objective,
world conceptualization,

116
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,440
and that's partly for,
as for us as modern people,

117
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,010
it forms the basis of so much of what we
think that we just think about it as 

118
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,100
axiomatic.
It's just true.

119
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,220
It doesn't bear any question,
but I'm going to offer you a couple of 

120
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,500
examples of why it might bear some 
questioning and you can,

121
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,270
you can think about,
you can think about it.

122
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,060
The first problem is that that the 
classical scientific view of the world 

123
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,200
has a very difficult time accounting for
certain things.

124
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:43,510
So for example,
these are called quality,

125
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,520
uh,
often by people who are interested in 

126
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,731
consciousness.
So knowing the wave length of light 

127
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,080
doesn't seem to tell you much about the 
subjective experience of color.

128
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,270
You know,
we,

129
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,100
we experienced,
for example,

130
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,410
in a non continuous fashion,
right?

131
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,230
Because we see discreet colors like 
you'd see in a rainbolt.

132
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,240
I mean they shade into each other to 
some degree,

133
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,020
but it's not like they go from light 
red,

134
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,000
dark red in the continuum,
there's clear demarcations of color.

135
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,240
While that's because of the way your 
brain is wired,

136
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,900
you know it,
it seems like over the course of 

137
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,151
evolution,
what we've learned is that parsing up 

138
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:23,091
that wavelength fragment in terms of 
categories which would be the different 

139
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:24,930
colors that we see has substantial 
practical utility.

140
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,460
Now what are the things you might ask 
is,

141
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,440
well,
do those colors exist?

142
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,350
Well,
objectively,

143
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,740
they don't seem to exist as colors,
partly because of the wavelengths that 

144
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,900
we see are actually continuous.
So when one color shades into another,

145
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,500
there's no radical transformation and 
wave lake length.

146
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,960
It's a continuum,
but we see it categorically.

147
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,310
Okay,
so is that real or not?

148
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,480
Or The colors we see real or not?
Well,

149
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,640
that's a good question.
Um,

150
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,760
you can't get a collective experience of
pain,

151
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,610
like you can get a collective experience
of the blackboard,

152
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,810
but pain seems to be something that's 
limited to subjective perception,

153
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:09,120
but it's very difficult.
No one acts as if pain isn't real.

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,200
I mean,
I would say that of all the things that 

155
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,161
you might consider real,
we act as if pain is the most real 

156
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:23,541
thing.
You certainly can't argue yourself out 

157
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:23,541
of it,
for example.

158
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,990
It seems like a fundamental element of 
experience.

159
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay,
so that's two places.

160
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,030
We also have no account in the 
subjective objective.

161
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,770
What breakup?
Bifurcation of the world.

162
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,470
We have no explanation whatsoever for 
consciousness.

163
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,840
That seems like a big problem,
right,

164
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:45,841
because you could make a case that 
there's no being without consciousness.

165
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,570
Like is there something if there's no 
one there to receive it,

166
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:54,571
by the way,
that is not the same question as if a 

167
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:54,571
tree falls in the forest and there was 
no one there to hear.

168
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,590
It doesn't make it sound.
It's not the same question.

169
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,000
It sounds superficially the same,
but this is a much more complex question

170
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:02,440
because we don't know.
For example,

171
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,630
if we don't know the relationship 
between time and consciousness,

172
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,540
like we have a certain perception of 
time.

173
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,960
We have a certain temporal realm within 
which we exist.

174
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,450
Our refresh rate for our vision,
for example,

175
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:21,451
is about 60 hertz,
which is why you can see computer 

176
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:22,150
screens flicker.
If they have a reflex rate that's slower

177
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:26,410
than that,
so 60 hertz to us looks continuous,

178
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:31,411
but you know there's a lot of 
microseconds in a second and for a 

179
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:35,041
computer,
especially a fast process it computer 

180
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:35,041
that can do maybe a trillion operations 
per second.

181
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,140
If it was watching,
so to speak,

182
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,350
a movie,
it would just see a picture still 

183
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,621
picture that was there forever and then 
another still picture that was there 

184
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,370
forever and like it wouldn't have the 
impression of continuous movement.

185
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,070
So there's this weird subjective element
to time.

186
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,090
It's very difficult to understand.
And then here's more,

187
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,950
here's a more complex criticism of the 
subject object idea.

188
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,580
I thought about this for a long time.
So the best example I know of it is I 

189
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,900
read this book a while back written by a
kgb officer and it was published after 

190
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:12,540
the fall of the,
you know,

191
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,490
the wall and the Soviet Empire.
And this KGB officer claimed that he had

192
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:19,670
worked in a biological warfare unit in 
the Soviet Union.

193
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:25,150
And the purpose of the biological 
warfare unit was to turn infectious 

194
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:29,540
diseases into aerosols so that they can 
be sprayed on enemy populations,

195
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,050
and so they were working on two things,
developing a very,

196
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:34,820
very silent infection.

197
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,820
And so if your infection is one that's 
very severe but also very transmissible 

198
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,500
because those things are separate and 
then also one that could survive being 

199
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,920
aerosolized because it turns out that 
that's quite difficult,

200
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,690
which we should all be very thankful 
about.

201
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,010
And one of the projects they were 
working on was a,

202
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,450
an attempt to cross Ebola was smallpox.
Now Ebola is,

203
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,300
you all know about Ebola,
I presume it's a.

204
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,310
it's very,
very fatal,

205
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,970
although they've learned ways to treat 
it now and maybe have a vaccine,

206
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:10,150
but at that time it was very,
very fatal and a smallpox is incredibly 

207
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:15,041
contagious and so they were hoping they 
could develop something that it was 

208
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:15,290
very,
very contagious and very,

209
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:20,291
very deadly that you could spray on 
civilian populations.

210
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:24,230
Now you know here,
here's where it gets tricky.

211
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,760
It gets tricky here because how you 
answered this question inevitably,

212
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,070
inevitably depends on how you define 
truth.

213
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,480
And truth is actually something you have
to define before you can have a 

214
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,301
conversation about it,
which is a kind of a strange thing 

215
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,300
anyways.
You can make a case that determining how

216
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,900
to cross Ebola with smallpox and 
aerosolized.

217
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:56,930
It is a perfectly valid scientific 
question

218
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:05,190
and because science is value free,
it's very difficult to make an argument 

219
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,221
that that's any worse experiment than 
any other kind of experiment or any 

220
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:11,911
other kind of investigation.
And you could also imagine even that if 

221
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:13,210
you didn't go to the aerosolization 
stage,

222
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:14,800
that positive things might come out of 
it.

223
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:19,801
Maybe you'd end up with a more detailed 
understanding of DNA or something as a 

224
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:22,180
consequence of the investigation that 
would have positive consequences.

225
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,750
But it still seems that the idea of 
doing scientific research across 

226
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:32,840
crossing Ebola,
smallpox,

227
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,050
it,
it seems to be something wrong about 

228
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,081
that.
And it's maybe that sense of wrongness 

229
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,950
as well that can't be captured with 
inside inside scientific models.

230
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,550
And so one of the things that you 
claimed in and Rogers and the is that in

231
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:57,761
some sense is that the scientific 
reality has to be encapsulated within a 

232
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,490
unethical reality rather than the other 
way around.

233
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,080
Now Rogers would say,
you know that feeling you have when you 

234
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,930
hear about someone crossing Ebola with 
smallpox,

235
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:13,550
that feeling you have in your body.
That's a real thing.

236
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:16,940
That feeling and that that's part of 
being

237
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,150
now

238
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,550
for the phenomenologists being is 
actually complicated to define and it's 

239
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:30,500
hard to understand,
but what the phenomenologists do,

240
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,270
we start with a different set of 
assumptions.

241
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,780
They don't assume that the best way to 
approach reality is to break it up into 

242
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:42,251
this objective and the object it presume
instead that the way that you should 

243
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:46,940
approach reality is by assuming that all
of your experiences real all of it.

244
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,320
Now,
that doesn't mean there aren't different

245
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:50,740
categories of experience,
you know,

246
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,750
because you could still say a dream and 
the experience you have walked dreaming 

247
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:01,841
of walking down the street and walking 
down the street are still different 

248
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:02,960
things.
And the phenomenologists would say,

249
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:07,961
yes,
you can keep your categorical 

250
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:10,360
distinctions in tact,
but you have to say that they're both 

251
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,360
real.

252
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,210
Now

253
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,270
this is an assumption and I told you 
why.

254
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:17,390
The assumptions generating part of the 
reason the assumption is generated.

255
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,940
The alternative assumption is because 
there are problems that emerged with the

256
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:25,790
set of assumptions that make up the 
scientific worldview.

257
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:30,791
Now,
it's not that surprising that the 

258
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,711
scientific worldview can't encompass the
subjective because the scientific world 

259
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:37,251
view was actually established by by 
Bacon and descartes safe and by well,

260
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,980
by other thinkers of that time,
it was set up to exclude the subjective 

261
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,990
from the conceptualization of objective 
reality.

262
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:50,720
So you can't really criticize science 
because he does that,

263
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:55,721
but you can say the fact that the 
subjective is excluded is a fault or at 

264
00:16:56,631 --> 00:17:01,631
least an incompleteness and that 
incompleteness sometimes has 

265
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:05,930
extraordinary extraordinarily serious 
consequences that you can't just dismiss

266
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,730
because you might say,
well,

267
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:12,731
have the Russians being the Soviets 
being successful in crossing Ebola with 

268
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:18,431
smallpox and aerosolizing it.
Then we might all be dead and then he 

269
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:22,631
might think that any theory that leads 
everyone to be dead might reasonably be 

270
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:28,400
criticized for its assumption to 
universal truth.

271
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,250
Now you can debate that,
but and,

272
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,030
and rightly so,
but all I'm pointing out,

273
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:37,700
is there a reasons to go at this from 
another approach?

274
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,520
Now,
it was Roger's basic assumption that you

275
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:51,331
were more likely to be properly oriented
in life if you adopted a phenomenal,

276
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:56,491
logical approach to your experience and 
to break up reality in that manner.

277
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,950
So let me give you an example.
When I,

278
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,910
when my daughter was about three,
she have nightmare and she came running 

279
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:09,910
into

280
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,560
her parent's bedroom and she told me her
dream and she was all upset by it.

281
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,740
She might've even been younger than 
three.

282
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:26,741
At that point had she had dreamed that 
there was a clear stream and that it was

283
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:31,970
quite beautiful and that there was 
garbage littering the bottom of it.

284
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,620
Now,
by that time,

285
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:34,270
you know,
she,

286
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,220
kids are quite sophisticated in their 
ability to categorize.

287
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:42,221
You know,
by that time she'd already learned the 

288
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:42,221
difference between a kid things and 
adult things.

289
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,440
And you think that's a bloody complex 
form of discrimination,

290
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,460
you know,
because like what objective features do 

291
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,970
adult things share in common that 
differentiates them from things you,

292
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
you can't actually come up with a set of
objective criteria that allows that 

293
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,390
distinction to be made.
But kids by the time they're three years

294
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:04,391
got a pretty clear grasp of that so they
can come up with very sophisticated 

295
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:04,430
classifications.

296
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,920
I'm about the same time and one of my 
friends had a two year old who went 

297
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:15,251
outside their house one day and looked 
down the street and there were a couple 

298
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:15,470
of garbage cans knocked over and the kid
said,

299
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,090
oh,
and you know,

300
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:19,520
that's also extremely sophisticated 
because you think,

301
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:24,521
you know,
the whole street is a very complex 

302
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:27,671
visual set of visual stimuli.
And to be able to glance at that and 

303
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:31,811
then to know that something is out of 
place and then to make an otter and 

304
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:35,461
solid to draw people's attention to it 
is a ridiculously sophisticated 

305
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:38,270
cognitive out.
And my daughter was doing the same thing

306
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,140
within the context of her dream.
So she was upset about this.

307
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,150
Now it's quite interesting because you 
think,

308
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:49,151
well why would someone who was three the
upset about the fact that a stream 

309
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,060
beautiful,
clear stream was with had garbage in it,

310
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,590
you know,
it's,

311
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,710
it's a really,
it's like innate environmentalism or 

312
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,680
something like that and a concern for 
the environment and that could easily be

313
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:01,700
the case,
you know what I mean?

314
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,410
If we found our environment up 
continually during our evolutionary 

315
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,101
history,
that was likely to have very negative 

316
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:12,101
consequences.
Even birds cleaned their own nest and so

317
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:13,700
the fees and you know,
they keep their hives,

318
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:18,701
cleaning all of that.
So it could be a very primordial 

319
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:19,000
instinct.
Anyway,

320
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:22,370
she came in with this dream and she was 
quite upset and then you think,

321
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,260
well there's a couple of things you 
could do about that.

322
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:29,150
You could say it's just a dream.
Don't worry about it,

323
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,680
go back to sleep,
but you know,

324
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,780
that's a philosophical statement,
right?

325
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,610
And it's,
it's,

326
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,820
it's a misleading one.
Or You could argue that it was 

327
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,061
misleading because what does,
it's just a dream mean?

328
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,730
Well,
it means that it's certainly not 

329
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:48,730
something to take,
like you would take serious.

330
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,050
Take something that occurred during the 
day,

331
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,610
seriously,
it's a mirror like a fantasy,

332
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,630
but with the definition of fantasy being
some fundamentally useless

333
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,560
act of what to play,
I suppose that you can ignore with no 

334
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:16,741
consequences and not only that,
but you should ignore it and you know 

335
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:20,671
that's.
That's not necessarily true because then

336
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:26,971
you're making the case or you might be 
making the case that you don't have to 

337
00:21:26,971 --> 00:21:27,790
pay attention to products of your 
imagination.

338
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,300
That seems like a pretty dopey thing to 
tell a child given a,

339
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:36,301
that anything creative that you ever 
produced is going to come out of your 

340
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:39,691
imagination and be the way that you set 
goals and plans for your future is by 

341
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:42,280
imagining them dreaming about them.
Right?

342
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:46,240
Everyone knows what it means to pursue a
dream and you know you might say,

343
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:47,110
well,
if you're depressed,

344
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:49,270
it means all your dreams have 
disappeared.

345
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,620
It's like so maybe you shouldn't be 
telling your child that it's just a 

346
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:55,900
dream and so you can go.

347
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,970
You can ignore it and go back to sleep.
You know,

348
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,310
you don't know exactly what you're doing
when you,

349
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,850
when you do that,
you're certainly not paying attention to

350
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:08,851
the child's experience because it's.
She did have that image and it did make 

351
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:13,441
her upset and those are facts and as far
as people like Rogers would be 

352
00:22:13,441 --> 00:22:14,050
concerned,
those are facts about reality.

353
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:17,740
Are there elements of reality and they 
should be dealt with as such.

354
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,510
So I told her to close her eyes and to 
bring the dream image APP,

355
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,390
inner imagination,
which she could do very well.

356
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,620
And then to imagine that she had some 
rubber boots on and that she could go 

357
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,421
into the street and pick out the garbage
and put it in the garbage bag and that 

358
00:22:39,421 --> 00:22:40,750
there was a garbage can nearby and she 
could put it in the garbage can.

359
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:45,751
And so we went through that and that 
calmed her down and then she went back 

360
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:45,940
to bed.

361
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,560
And then you might say,
well,

362
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,930
what?
What am I doing doing that?

363
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,670
Because you might say,
well,

364
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:59,671
that's just a fantasy.
Just like the dream and because they're 

365
00:22:59,671 --> 00:22:59,671
just fantasies.
Neither of them have anything to do with

366
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:02,440
reality.
But you know that again,

367
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:07,441
that's not very sophisticated way of 
thinking because the dream presented my 

368
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:11,011
daughter with a problem,
or you could even say a class of 

369
00:23:11,011 --> 00:23:13,561
problems and the class of problems.
It includes all of those things that 

370
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,070
people do too and I and other animals,
of course,

371
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,130
all the ways that the environment can be
defiled well,

372
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:27,340
that actually is an existential problem,
and then you might say,

373
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:30,390
well,
what should you do about it now?

374
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:31,330
So that might be,
well,

375
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:36,331
maybe you should do something about it 
in so far as you can do something about 

376
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,700
it because then you're conceptualizing 
yourself as an active agent and not just

377
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:44,050
a passive victim or a passive recipient 
of the problem.

378
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,110
You could actually do something about it
and that's a way different messages.

379
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:51,380
Then it's just a dream.
You can ignore it and go back to sleep.

380
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:57,010
You know what you've maybe you shouldn't
actually tell your child to be ignoring 

381
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,250
reality and go back to sleep.
Maybe you should be telling them to wake

382
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:02,840
up and see reality as clearly as they 
possibly can and not ignore any of it,

383
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,390
including their fantasies.
In their dreams,

384
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:10,391
and that doesn't mean that they're 
fantasies have the same reality as the 

385
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:11,930
reality that you experience with 
everyone else,

386
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:18,610
but the fact that it's not the same 
reality that you experience with 

387
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:18,610
everyone else doesn't mean it's not 
reality.

388
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,650
Now Rogers would claim,
for example,

389
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:26,651
that to ignore a private experience 
warps you fundamentally.

390
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,400
So

391
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,730
here's the basic outlines of his view of
the world,

392
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:42,731
so there's first of all,
you exist within a phenomenal logical 

393
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,520
field.
Now phenomenon.

394
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,880
Phenomenon comes from the Greek word 
famous thigh and famous thigh means to 

395
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,531
shine forth and so phenomena are those 
things that shine forth for you.

396
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Now the way to understand that is to 
imagine that you're reading a book and 

397
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:04,970
maybe a passage of it really strikes you
as meaningful.

398
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,830
Well then you might say,
well,

399
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,280
why?
There's lots of passages in the book.

400
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,580
If someone else was reading the book,
it's not obvious that the same passage 

401
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,900
would strike them,
and then you might say,

402
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:22,901
well,
is that a consequence of the structure 

403
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:22,901
of you as as a,
as a,

404
00:25:22,901 --> 00:25:26,680
as an interpreter of the book?
Or is it a consequence of the contents 

405
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,191
of the book and the answer to that is 
you actually can't tell because the book

406
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:32,840
is neither the thing that's printed,
nor the reader.

407
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:37,220
The book is the interaction between the 
reader and the book,

408
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,160
and that interaction is actually unique 
for each person.

409
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Even though there might be some 
commonalities across people because 

410
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:45,400
otherwise you would need to be able to 
talk about a book.

411
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,520
Well,

412
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,770
regardless when you're interacting with 
something,

413
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,890
some things announced themselves on your
field of consciousness and other things 

414
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,450
don't,
and so the phenomenologists would say,

415
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:03,970
well,
something shine forth for you.

416
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,560
Well,
other things don't.

417
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,820
It's a little bit like one of us ideas 
about the development of the self.

418
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,780
Don't believe that if you follow the 
things that announced themselves to you 

419
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:25,111
as meaningful,
that they would take you to through a 

420
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:30,031
descent to begin with where you would 
encounter things you were afraid of or 

421
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:32,380
terrified of and disgusted by and wanted
to avoid.

422
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,740
And then the consequence of that would 
be that you do incorporate a lot of new 

423
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,251
material into your personality and the 
consequences of that would be you'd be 

424
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:42,880
reborn roughly speaking as a stronger 
person,

425
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:47,881
and then if you just kept doing that all
the time for the rest of your life in 

426
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,470
small and large ways,
that you'd become more and more and more

427
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,920
fully differentiated and developed,
and he wouldn't have said that the the 

428
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,300
ultimate potential target of that kind 
of development was what he described as 

429
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:05,481
the self.
The self is a multifaceted 

430
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,840
conceptualization,
so that's not all there is to it,

431
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:13,841
but the self from the union perspective 
is who you could be if you could be who 

432
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,580
you most deeply are.
If you didn't shy away from anything,

433
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,060
if you,
if you accurately encountered and then 

434
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,910
integrated even in a pod and sense your 
experience.

435
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,280
Now that's.
That's exactly the same idea that Rogers

436
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:30,860
had.
He believed that

437
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,910
there's a phenomenal field and it's full
of experience.

438
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:41,270
All of your experience manifests itself 
as the phenomenal field is quite 

439
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,651
interesting because if it means also 
that other people are part of your 

440
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:46,170
phenomenal field,
part of your experience,

441
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,490
and then that all within that field,
there's a circumscribed area that he 

442
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:56,490
described as the self that's it's 
different than the union itself,

443
00:27:56,491 --> 00:28:01,491
so it somewhat terminological confusing.
Roger yourself is more like Freud's ego,

444
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,760
but Rogers would define myself as those 
aspects of the phenomenological field 

445
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,830
that you,
that you call.

446
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,730
I felt like I've had clients who tended 
to talk in the third person about their 

447
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:27,291
emotions or they would say the body.
They wouldn't say I maybe they're 

448
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,760
describing cutting themselves.
They'd say,

449
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:34,760
well,
the body needed to be cut,

450
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:36,520
and

451
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,080
what Rogers would say about that was 
that

452
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,450
person existed in the phenomenological 
field and part of that phenomenal 

453
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,090
logical field was demarcated by the 
self,

454
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,600
like the self hadn't expanded to 
incorporate as much of that 

455
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,270
phenomenological field as it should 
have.

456
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,800
The other concept he had was the con.
Another concept he had was the concept 

457
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,401
of the organism.
Now you can think of the self as what 

458
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:11,681
you identified with it and then you can 
think of the organism as all those 

459
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:15,430
things that are unique to you that you 
might identify with the art.

460
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Now it's tricky because imagine that you
get angry during a fight with someone 

461
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,240
argument and they say,
you're angry and you say,

462
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,100
no,
I'm not lost.

463
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:28,580
Like what exactly are you doing there?
The other person we're gonna.

464
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:31,220
Assume the other person is right for the
sake of this argument.

465
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,510
They can clearly see that you're angry,
but you're not

466
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,770
allowing

467
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,200
the organismic manifestation of 
motivational state or emotion to be 

468
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:47,530
incorporated with those things that you 
identify with.

469
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,760
Rogers would call that into groans and 
he believed that incongruent was roughly

470
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:04,001
equivalent to psychopathology,
so that part of your goal was to

471
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,220
was for the organism to respond 
appropriately to the broader 

472
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:18,870
phenomenological field.
Now we can talk about what appropriately

473
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:20,340
means,
but we won't do that yet,

474
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,580
and then what the self was supposed to 
do is accurately symbolically represent 

475
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,590
organismic responses to the broader 
phenomenological field.

476
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,970
So now you can see that there are 
similarities between that concept and 

477
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,771
say Freud's idea of the ego and they 
know because the Ed was this sort of 

478
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:44,391
external thing that was the home of 
motivational and emotional forces that 

479
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:50,361
couldn't be easily integrated into the 
ego and for partly because the Super Ego

480
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:52,350
said,
for example,

481
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,600
that they were wrong and so there is 
this,

482
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,440
these sets of phenomena you know,
that all of the different clinicians are

483
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:03,441
talking about,
but all of them are talking about it 

484
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:05,730
starting from different initial 
presuppositions and it's like a group of

485
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:08,920
people in the room shining a flashlight 
on a very complex object.

486
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,920
You know,
they're all standing in a slightly 

487
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:13,920
different position.
The complex object is the same thing,

488
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,961
but you can only see parts of it and so 
you need multiple different ways of 

489
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:21,801
looking at things so that you can come 
up with a cohesive and coherent account 

490
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,090
of something that's actually beyond your
understanding.

491
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,740
Because of course not only can you not 
accurately,

492
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:32,400
symbolically represented the 
phenomenological world,

493
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,580
the entire domain of your being,
you can't accurately represent even the 

494
00:31:39,061 --> 00:31:44,061
organismic.
The aspect of that field that's related 

495
00:31:44,061 --> 00:31:48,270
to the organismic you,
there's this part of you on top that you

496
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:50,670
identify with,
I roughly speaking,

497
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:56,270
and it's trying to model a model of 
something very complex and of course 

498
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,100
that's extraordinarily difficult.
Now why is it doing that?

499
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,570
That's the central mystery of 
consciousness.

500
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:09,571
You know,
there's this problem that consciousness 

501
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:11,830
researchers always refer to it.
It's an annoyingly termed,

502
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:16,831
I think it's called the Zombie problem,
and the Zombie problem is why is 

503
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:22,831
consciousness necessary?
Like why is it necessary for something 

504
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,970
complex like a human being to actually 
have awareness and self awareness?

505
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:32,971
Why couldn't it just wander through the 
world reacting in predetermined 

506
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,980
deterministic fashion?
Zombie like no awareness robot,

507
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,450
like let's say what's consciousness for

508
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,440
Rogers doesn't really discuss that and 
so we won't at the moment.

509
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,930
Although I think there are some 
reasonable ideas.

510
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,130
Consciousness,
for example,

511
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,700
I was using generalized between certain 
phenomena anyways,

512
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,840
regardless,
there's the self,

513
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:06,150
the organism in the broader 
phenomenological field.

514
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,460
Let's say you go into a

515
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,640
pub bar

516
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:23,450
and you're,
you've been there many times and so you 

517
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:23,610
know the people in there,
you know where to sit.

518
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,220
You know what's going to happen.
You may have friends there,

519
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,010
you might say that your organism

520
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,230
exists

521
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,190
at least in part as a very accurate 
model of that broader,

522
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:36,360
phenomenal,
logical world,

523
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,440
and then inside that you're aware of 
your knowledge of them,

524
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,390
the bar,
and so

525
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,250
if your organism is properly adapted to 
the broader phenomenological field,

526
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,600
when you go into the bar or other 
familiar place,

527
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,960
things that you expect and want happened
instead of things that you neither 

528
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,040
expect nor one,
and you could say,

529
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:10,480
well perhaps that's a reasonable 
definition of adaptation.

530
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,520
Now this isn't biological revolutionary 
identification,

531
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:15,370
right?
This is personal adaptations.

532
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:20,740
There are similar in some ways,
but importantly different mean you can 

533
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:26,521
be adapted to an environment without 
that in any way having any effect 

534
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:27,280
whatsoever on your evolutionary 
adaptiveness.

535
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:27,490
So

536
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:36,870
now if you're,
maybe you're not very well organism 

537
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:41,130
actually adapted to the environment.
You have a model of it and because of 

538
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,270
that,
when you go somewhere familiar,

539
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:48,390
people don't like you as much as you 
think they do and you're not nearly as 

540
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:52,621
much of a master of that situation as 
you think you are and one of the 

541
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:56,341
consequences of that,
so that would mean that your self 

542
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,920
representation is too rigid and 
simplistic and full of defenses to 

543
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:04,051
notice the discrepancy between your 
organism and the broader environment 

544
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:08,100
that's pathological and the way that's 
going to be marked is first by anxiety.

545
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,720
You know,
maybe you tell a joke.

546
00:35:10,721 --> 00:35:15,721
There's some people sitting around you,
you tell a joke and you see people kind 

547
00:35:15,721 --> 00:35:15,721
of,
you know,

548
00:35:15,721 --> 00:35:16,540
making that face maybe rolling their 
eyes.

549
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:18,080
It's like,
well that's not exactly.

550
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:18,730
You might think,
well,

551
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:19,600
they're joking.
You know,

552
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,010
they're just,
they're just teasing me.

553
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:26,310
Well maybe they're not.
Maybe they're damn sick of your stupid 

554
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,651
stories and you've told them 50 times 
and you're not very funny and they'd 

555
00:35:28,651 --> 00:35:31,690
rather you work in the bar at all and it
may be that you'll actually notice that,

556
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:37,290
but you don't necessarily notice it in a
symbolically fully symbolically 

557
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,700
developed.
Now,

558
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:43,850
what that would mean is maybe you start 
feeling anxiety and Roger's identify as 

559
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:49,401
different levels of feeling.
It might start with this subception and 

560
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,280
to succeed something which is a word 
that I guess comes from general 

561
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,151
semantics,
is to have the event affect the way that

562
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:07,620
you're interacting with the world in 
ways that you don't necessarily notice,

563
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:13,010
so it sort of equivalent to the idea of 
subliminal when you're talking about 

564
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:17,271
advertising messages.
Flashed out unit suddenly changes the 

565
00:36:17,271 --> 00:36:18,480
way that you're interacting with the 
world,

566
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:23,481
but you don't notice that.
That and that happens to people all the 

567
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:23,481
time.

568
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,030
I mean it's actually a part of our 
normal cognitive structure and when you 

569
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,911
walk into this room,
the room tells you all sorts of things 

570
00:36:28,911 --> 00:36:32,901
about how to behave and you don't notice
that the room is telling you those 

571
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:35,310
things because you know what it's 
telling you so well that you just act it

572
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:40,311
out.
You don't need to go through all the 

573
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:41,280
complex processes of actually perceiving
and thinking about it,

574
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,720
and so Roger's oranges that you can 
detect things organismic Lee.

575
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,500
That will affect the nature of your 
experience without necessarily either 

576
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,690
even perceiving that or definitely not 
symbolically representing it.

577
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,220
Now maybe the social discomfort that's 
inherent in the situation rises up to 

578
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:04,680
the level of perception that's not 
symbolization yet.

579
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,330
Then you might think,
well,

580
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,760
what does it feel like to be anxious?

581
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,150
Well,
that,

582
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:17,510
and I'm not asking what are the 
objective markers of being anxious 

583
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,860
because we actually don't know those.
We know we can kind of infer them.

584
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:25,370
Sometimes people's heart rate goes up,
but sometimes it decelerates and then 

585
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,090
there are facial expressions that are 
associated with anxiety,

586
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:30,240
but you have to use those to infer.
If you get anxious,

587
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,000
I don't feel your anxiety,
I have to infer it,

588
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:38,120
but if you get anxious,
you feel your anxiety and so then the 

589
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,120
question might be,
well,

590
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,090
what does it mean to feel anxious?

591
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,440
Wealth?

592
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,890
That's a hard question and the reason 
it's a hard question is because you 

593
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,790
never have to answer it because if you 
tell someone I felt anxious,

594
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,570
then they refer to their own feelings of
anxiety and then they know what you mean

595
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:56,050
and you never have to come up with an 
explanation of what it feels like.

596
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:01,860
The feeling this,
the idea that the feeling is an element 

597
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,910
of experience is something that we just 
take for granted.

598
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,590
You know,
I got angry today.

599
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:07,840
Everybody nods or maybe I tell a little 
story and say,

600
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:08,260
well,
you know,

601
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:13,270
I got on the bus and I was missing like 
two cents and I asked the bus driver if 

602
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,090
he would let me get on the bus and he 
didn't and not really annoyed me because

603
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:21,091
I take that bus everyday and the driver 
knows me and I got angry and everybody 

604
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:21,091
not.

605
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,850
And the reason they nod is a partly 
because they can imagine that that's how

606
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:26,410
they would have reacted in that 
situation.

607
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:31,411
But even more importantly,
they accept the reality of angry as a 

608
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:33,310
response and they know what it feels 
like.

609
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:39,330
So explaining it.
That's a much more difficult thing,

610
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:45,610
so the point is is that you can have 
experiences that you know of.

611
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:50,670
First of all,
you can have experiences that you don't 

612
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:50,670
know of that would be the subsea 
experiences.

613
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,631
Then you can have experiences that you 
perceive but that you haven't 

614
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:58,831
symbolically represented and those might
be emotional or motivational 

615
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:01,801
experiences,
and then you can have experiences that 

616
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:04,741
you have symbolically represented in a 
way that captures their just accurately 

617
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:09,570
in a way that's reflective of your 
adaptation or lack thereof to the 

618
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,411
broader phenomena.
Logical world and Rogers would say that 

619
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:14,290
latter state is preferable.

620
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:21,530
You know how to act or you know that you
didn't act properly and you know how to 

621
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:27,271
fix it,
which is almost as good and you 

622
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:29,671
represent that accurately.
Now you might imagine that you could 

623
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:34,891
concentrate on the mismatch between 
organismic responses and the 

624
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:39,301
environment.
That's what behavior therapists really 

625
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:39,301
do.
They say,

626
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:43,981
well,
how are you acting and what are the 

627
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,501
consequences,
but that isn't really where Roger's 

628
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:49,381
goes.
Rogers is more psychoanalytic than the 

629
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:54,271
behavior therapists and what he seems to
be primarily concerned about is whether 

630
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:58,621
or not your self representation is an 
accurate representation of of how your 

631
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:01,240
organism is responding.
In some sense,

632
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:04,960
for Rogers,
the organism takes the place of God.

633
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:10,290
It's more or less omniscient,
so your organism is going to tell you 

634
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:15,781
the truth in every situation and it's up
to you whether or not you're going to 

635
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:21,570
pay attention to that and make sense of 
it or whether you're going to engage in 

636
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:27,571
any of the different kinds of 
shenanigans that you might engage in to 

637
00:40:27,571 --> 00:40:30,700
stop yourself from going through the 
complex process of symbolization.

638
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,860
Because you might say,
well,

639
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,440
you're back in the bar and you might 
say,

640
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:40,590
well,
you notice the anxiety and then you 

641
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:40,590
know,
different ways of symbolizing it.

642
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,990
Come to mind.
These people are all people are all just

643
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,560
jerks.
And then another thing comes to mind is,

644
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:49,120
well,
maybe nobody likes me.

645
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:54,810
And then maybe another idea that's 
associated with symbolization comes to 

646
00:40:55,061 --> 00:40:55,690
mind,
which is,

647
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:01,380
well,
maybe there's elements of my social 

648
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,271
behavior that I should adjust.
And I presume that if Roger's was having

649
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:07,390
a conversation with one of his clients,
he would assume that that was the most,

650
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,460
that was the most fruitful potential 
step towards accurate symbolization.

651
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:19,290
Now Roger's felt that anxiety emerged 
when the self concept was not accurately

652
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:24,730
symbolically representing the organisms 
experiences,

653
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,360
and so that would be in some sense if 
you're a house divided within yourself,

654
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,760
then you're your pathological from a 
Rogerian perspective.

655
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:40,030
And you can think about that in some 
sense as a move away from necessary.

656
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:41,600
Simplicity

657
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,620
mean

658
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,700
if your self concept is set up property,
it doesn't contain contradictory and 

659
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:53,460
misleading bits of information.
Everything works seamlessly together.

660
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:56,970
And so what that would mean is that you 
think about something,

661
00:41:56,971 --> 00:42:01,971
you act it out and it works,
and then that's an indication that the 

662
00:42:02,491 --> 00:42:07,491
organization between say these different
three different levels of being is the 

663
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:13,071
right word,
is icer morphing each represents the 

664
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,651
other with sufficient accuracy.
And so that means that you're congruent 

665
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:20,640
and if you're congruent,
then the world is treating you not only 

666
00:42:22,141 --> 00:42:23,730
in the manner that you want to be 
treated,

667
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,120
but also in the manner that's most 
likely.

668
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:28,270
Two

669
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,170
further your actions in the world as an 
organism,

670
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:38,950
and so that's partly why Rogers believed
that the organism had wisdom because 

671
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,600
it's natural proclivity was to operate 
in the world effectively and to expand 

672
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:50,501
its competence at the same time and what
self actualized person because that's 

673
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:56,360
one of Roger's phrases is someone who 
self concept accurately represents their

674
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:56,990
organismic

675
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:57,810
being.

676
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,510
Now Rogers was primarily a clinician as 
well,

677
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:16,890
and his theories were derived from his 
clinical experience and his theories 

678
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:24,211
informed his clinical practice and 
Roger's invented or developed what he 

679
00:43:25,181 --> 00:43:30,160
believed to be a new kind of therapy and
he called that client centered therapy.

680
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,090
Now you've probably heard about student 
centered education in Rogers.

681
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:37,120
I ideas have had a tremendous amount of 
influence,

682
00:43:37,121 --> 00:43:39,340
certainly not at least in educational 
psychology.

683
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,430
Also in conflict reduction of various 
sorts.

684
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,630
You start with Rogers initial 
assumptions,

685
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:52,631
which is first of all,
you should regard your experience as 

686
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:53,810
real.
Second,

687
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:58,811
that your organism will give you 
accurate information about the totality 

688
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:03,611
of experience and third,
that your self concept should accurately

689
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:10,091
encompass your actual experience.
There are implications of that theory 

690
00:44:10,091 --> 00:44:14,351
for therapy and one of the implications 
is that you can figure out what you 

691
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:19,661
should do if you want to because your 
organism will tell you or at least hint 

692
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:28,180
at you about which directions are 
correct and which directions are,

693
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,330
and if you follow those,
then you're going to naturally gravitate

694
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:38,331
towards a state of being where you're 
more and more accurately represented by 

695
00:44:38,331 --> 00:44:42,111
yourself,
but also that your representation and 

696
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,430
your organism are going to act more 
effectively in the world.

697
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:49,431
They're not bumping up against each 
other all the time and you know they're 

698
00:44:49,971 --> 00:44:54,971
not even conflict anymore,
and so that's the goal of the self 

699
00:44:55,081 --> 00:45:00,081
actualized person at therapy in part is 
the art of furthering that process of 

700
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:07,480
self actualization.
Now,

701
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:12,481
Rogers Rogers

702
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:20,210
was opposed to diagnosis because he felt
that it didn't sufficiently represent 

703
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,120
the vital minutia of the client's 
individual experience and I think 

704
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:40,611
that's.
I think that his claim was extremely 

705
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:42,530
important.
No,

706
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:47,630
because medicine psychiatry tends to 
classify everything and you might say,

707
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:57,891
well,
are the psychiatric diagnostic 

708
00:45:57,891 --> 00:45:58,950
classifications real?
And then the answer that is,

709
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:02,260
it depends on what you mean by real 
anyway.

710
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,280
Think well that's an annoying answer,
but it is.

711
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:10,370
It is still the answer.
So I could say if I was being cynical,

712
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,530
although I don't really think it's a 
cynical response,

713
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:18,650
if I was willing to sound cynical,
that the only reason that psychiatrist 

714
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,920
diagnosed their clients is so that 
insurance companies can pay the bills 

715
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,190
and I actually believe that that's more 
true than the claim,

716
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:31,191
that the psychiatric diagnostic 
categories accurately actually capture 

717
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:35,480
the essence of the person's problems.
In my clinical experience,

718
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,440
classification has had almost zero 
utility and the reason for that is 

719
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:48,291
because it's too low resolution.
It doesn't capture the individual 

720
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:51,741
property because the thing about a 
client clinical client is that it's 

721
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:57,420
precisely their individuality.
That's the fundamental issue.

722
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,450
It's like they have to make their way 
through the world in their body and 

723
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:06,831
their in their time and their position 
in culture with their advantages and 

724
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:12,231
disadvantages.
And that requires a unique solution 

725
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:17,070
that's unique in many ways.
And one that's also personally

726
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:26,150
and rogers also wasn't a particularly 
great fan of the psychoanalysts tendency

727
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:34,651
to look for the causes of present 
behavior in past events so he didn't.

728
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:42,730
He didn't regard fishing in the past as 
a useful,

729
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:47,790
necessarily useful expedition or as 
unnecessary expedition.

730
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:51,010
Although if issues of the past came up 
in therapy,

731
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:56,011
he was perfectly willing to to to deal 
with them.

732
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,860
He didn't accept except the Freudian 
theory that the fundamental cause of 

733
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,451
psychopathology was saying traumatic 
past experience.

734
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,700
Right

735
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:15,770
now,
this gives Rogerian therapy a particular

736
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:20,830
flavor.
You could also call it non directive 

737
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,140
therapy.
Now if you're a behavior therapist,

738
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:33,070
you might actively strategize with your 
client about what they're going to do in

739
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:37,010
the next week and then once they've 
established their goals,

740
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:42,700
you might offer some hints about what 
strategies they could use to monitor 

741
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,991
themselves and to attain those goals and
maybe you'll even have to keep track of 

742
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:50,000
it.
Roger's generally speaking,

743
00:48:50,001 --> 00:48:55,001
wouldn't do something that directive and
in fact he strove not to unduly 

744
00:48:56,031 --> 00:48:59,870
influenced the client's decisions about 
important future events.

745
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,890
And in that way,
he was quite similar to Freud because 

746
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:07,040
Freud would sit behind,
would sit,

747
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,380
so the client would be laying on a couch
and fred would sit so that the client is

748
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:16,390
patient,
actually couldn't see him and then he 

749
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:16,390
would listen to the person free 
associate,

750
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:21,281
which in some sense means that they 
would ramble on and he was attempting by

751
00:49:21,531 --> 00:49:26,531
doing that to facilitate the self 
realization of their,

752
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:29,840
of their own memories.

753
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,100
If things happened to you in your past 
and they still cause you emotion,

754
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,800
let's say they're more than 18 months 
old for the sake of argument,

755
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:42,750
Freud,
but assume that if you kind of wandered 

756
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,891
around that memory somewhat haphazardly 
and in an in an association will weigh 

757
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:50,130
the way conversations naturally unfold,
that you would bring things to light and

758
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,820
that would allow a certain kinds of 
emotional expression in that.

759
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:57,821
And in fact in itself would be curative.
But for I didn't want to with your fear 

760
00:49:57,821 --> 00:49:59,330
with that process or guided to any great
degree.

761
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:04,331
And so rogers was like that he,
he wanted you to make your own 

762
00:50:04,331 --> 00:50:07,331
decisions.
So he believed that the therapeutic 

763
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:11,051
endeavor required could not,
could not occur unless certain 

764
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,520
conditions were met and the conditions 
were

765
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:26,190
willingness to tell the truth.
So when,

766
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,760
when a client comes to see me,
one of the first things I tell them is,

767
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:37,990
you can tell me anything you want,
although you're perfectly within your 

768
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:42,320
rights to maintain your privacy,
you can tell me anything you want,

769
00:50:42,321 --> 00:50:45,080
but tell me the truth as much as clearly
as you can.

770
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:46,190
Because if you don't,
there isn't.

771
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:51,550
I don't know what's going on with you 
and there's not a possibility on any 

772
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:55,361
possibility at all that I can,
that this process will be useful if 

773
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:57,710
we're talking about things that don't 
exist.

774
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,490
So one precondition is the person is 
willing to come and see you.

775
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,960
So that means they want to transform.
The second precondition is that they're 

776
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,081
going to communicate with you and 
communication means they're going to do 

777
00:51:11,081 --> 00:51:13,310
their best to tell the truth.
But the therapist takes the same

778
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,520
vow in a sense.
And so one of the things that I tell my 

779
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,431
clients is that I will never let them do
anything that makes me resent them.

780
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,700
So if I'm asked to step out of my way 
for some reason to take an additional 

781
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,230
session or maybe to meet them somewhere 
and I do it,

782
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,620
they can be assured that there won't be 
a price that will be extracted from them

783
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:43,750
later for interfering with the smooth 
flow of my day.

784
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,760
So,
and the other thing that I do,

785
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:52,120
and I've learned this from Rogers and 
from the other people I've read,

786
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:57,121
is that I'll listen to people talk and 
then sometimes something will occur to 

787
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:02,701
me and I don't think about it as I 
thought something because I'm actually 

788
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:06,970
somewhat a follower of nickname.
She's dictum,

789
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:10,310
which is that the fact that you think is
no approved,

790
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:15,330
that the fact that you experienced 
thoughts is no proof that you thought it

791
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:22,130
just appeared.
While you don't think that you think 

792
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:23,050
that your dreams right,
you have your dreams.

793
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,110
There you are in band.
They're the dreams.

794
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,180
Are you having them?
Well,

795
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:34,080
it doesn't seem like it.
It seems like you're experiencing this 

796
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,750
in some sense the same way you 
experienced the external world 

797
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:37,570
voluntarily creating them.
Well,

798
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,600
why do you think anything different 
about your thoughts?

799
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,310
And that's a very useful thing to 
realize by the way because otherwise you

800
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:48,620
think your your thoughts and then if you
have negative thoughts,

801
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:53,621
well then you assume that they're true 
and they're not true just because you 

802
00:52:53,621 --> 00:52:58,391
think that they are just thoughts and 
maybe they're true and maybe they're 

803
00:52:58,391 --> 00:53:01,121
useful and maybe they're not.
So stepping back from them a little bit 

804
00:53:01,121 --> 00:53:05,020
is incredibly.
It's like Buddhist detachment in a 

805
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,180
sense.
It's an incredibly useful thing to do.

806
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:10,520
I mean that's another thing that's 
really characteristic of modern people 

807
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,361
because especially if they're smart,
they think they think first of all and 

808
00:53:13,361 --> 00:53:18,161
second they think that the things they 
think are true and neither of those 

809
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:21,530
things are necessarily true and 
abandoning your belief in them.

810
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:26,531
It makes you much less rigid and much 
more able to expand your preconceptions 

811
00:53:33,031 --> 00:53:36,180
or even radically change them when the 
circumstances demand them.

812
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:42,650
So the person has to be wanting to 
change in principal in a positive 

813
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:51,381
direction.
They have to be willing to tell the 

814
00:53:51,381 --> 00:53:53,811
truth.
Then the next element of Rogerian 

815
00:53:53,811 --> 00:53:56,780
psychotherapy is something that he 
called unconditional positive regard and

816
00:54:01,461 --> 00:54:06,461
unconditional positive regard,
and the Rogerian tradition is something 

817
00:54:06,461 --> 00:54:11,081
like radical acceptance.
It's actually a hallmark of modern child

818
00:54:12,321 --> 00:54:17,321
rearing techniques.
You should wholeheartedly accept all 

819
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:22,391
aspects of the person's being.
Now Rogers believed that are positive,

820
00:54:28,071 --> 00:54:32,000
that partly because he also believed in

821
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,940
what was it called,

822
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,670
conditions of worth.

823
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,690
Here's the condition of worth.
I don't like you when you act like that,

824
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,400
so you imagine you might tell a child 
that I don't like you when you act like 

825
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,100
that and maybe you tell them that about 
a bunch of things that they do,

826
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:04,330
but maybe those are integral parts of 
the child's being and by making your 

827
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,310
lack of acceptance,
no,

828
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,930
you make it impossible for the child to 
incorporate.

829
00:55:14,931 --> 00:55:19,931
Those aspects of his organism.
Organism will experience into a self 

830
00:55:19,931 --> 00:55:24,011
concept.
You can see echoes of the Super Ego 

831
00:55:24,011 --> 00:55:27,500
Eagle idea there and so rogers would 
say,

832
00:55:27,501 --> 00:55:32,501
well,
if someone comes into psychotherapy and 

833
00:55:32,501 --> 00:55:32,900
experiences unconditional positive 
regard,

834
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:38,470
that means that they'll be able to 
reveal those elements up their 

835
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:42,370
organismic experience that have been 
rejected and say by the social world and

836
00:55:42,531 --> 00:55:47,531
themselves experienced them and then 
potentially incorporate them within the 

837
00:55:48,651 --> 00:55:53,651
self concept and that that's going to be
a good thing because rogers is a great 

838
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:57,800
believer in the natural inevitability of
positive transformation.

839
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:03,490
If if you set that up as your your goal,
he also believes that that should be 

840
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:08,060
your goal and that it's actually your 
natural goal.

841
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,520
If,
for example,

842
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,020
you haven't been subjected to arbitrary 
conditions of worth,

843
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,410
now I'm going to read you something that
Rodger's road,

844
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,160
which is quite interesting and I think I
found it extremely effective.

845
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:42,240
Oh yes.
That's another thing I should mention.

846
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:48,020
There is one other important assumption 
in the idea of self actualization.

847
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,920
The other thing that Roger tried to 
ensure that his clients develop was 

848
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,530
autonomy and independence.
Now for Rogers,

849
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:11,360
there was very little difference between
the move towards autonomy and in any and

850
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:15,840
personal independence and the process of
self actualization.

851
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:20,430
Now,

852
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,370
given that we're looking back at Roger's
work,

853
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:31,750
50 years later,
you might ask yourself is if autonomy 

854
00:57:34,791 --> 00:57:39,791
and independence is a necessary 
precondition for psychological health 

855
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,960
because you could make the case that 
productive interdependence and more 

856
00:57:47,781 --> 00:57:52,781
communal orientation is equally healthy,
but that's not a Rogerian 

857
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:56,140
presupposition,

858
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:57,950
so

859
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,210
his ideal is the fully functioning 
individual.

860
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:15,500
So here's his hypothesis with regards to
psychotherapy,

861
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:22,750
assuming a minimal mutual willingness to
be in contact and to receive 

862
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:27,341
communications,
we may say that the greater the 

863
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:31,151
communicated congruence of experience,
awareness and behavior on the part of 

864
00:58:31,151 --> 00:58:34,991
one individual,
the more the ensuing relationship will 

865
00:58:34,991 --> 00:58:37,040
involve a tendency towards reciprocal 
communication with the same qualities,

866
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:41,870
mutually accurate understanding of the 
communication's improved,

867
00:58:41,871 --> 00:58:46,871
psychological adjustment and functioning
in both parties and mutual satisfaction 

868
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:48,140
in the relationship.
Okay,

869
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:52,850
so let's unpack that.
Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to

870
00:58:52,851 --> 00:58:55,520
be in contact and to receive 
communication well,

871
00:58:55,521 --> 00:58:58,250
the first thing you might say is that 
it's pretty much thought the hallmark of

872
00:58:58,251 --> 00:59:00,590
a relationship,
right?

873
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:05,650
Because if you're not in contact,
well clearly you don't have a 

874
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:07,070
relationship and if you are in contact 
but you're not communicating,

875
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,880
you probably don't have a relationship.

876
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,740
Alright,
so

877
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:17,930
and you know,
that also begs the question of exactly 

878
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,031
what a relationship is for and that's 
something that's very much worth 

879
00:59:20,031 --> 00:59:22,880
considering because people don't really 
usually know what a relationship is for.

880
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,810
They certainly know that as a general 
rule they're going to pursue them,

881
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:32,140
but they don't really have any idea in 
some sense what the optimal state is or 

882
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,670
what the desired final state should be.
Now,

883
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:38,750
of course the desired final state 50 
years ago was marriage,

884
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,330
but I don't.

885
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,600
It's certainly the case now that most 
people who are couples aren't married.

886
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:48,940
Now you might ask yourself,
well,

887
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:53,941
what's the utility of a relationship and
what's the utility of a long term 

888
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:56,730
relationship?
Well,

889
00:59:56,731 --> 01:00:01,731
the Rogerian answer to that would be the
more based on trust the relationship is 

890
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:14,890
the more likely that you're going to be 
in contact and to receive communications

891
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:20,810
and then as a consequence of that,
you're going to become better and better

892
01:00:25,871 --> 01:00:30,871
at representing your organismal 
experience within your self concept,

893
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:36,910
and that's going to facilitate your 
movement towards self awareness and self

894
01:00:36,911 --> 01:00:37,780
actualization.

895
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:41,980
It's a two.
Brains are better than one idea.

896
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,110
So we say,
well,

897
01:00:44,111 --> 01:00:46,270
we established a relationship.
Okay,

898
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:49,180
and the goal of our relationship is to 
make things better,

899
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:55,380
and we we make a presupposition that the
way you make things better is by telling

900
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:58,270
the truth as you see it.
So remember,

901
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:03,271
this is a phenomenological theory,
and so the truth that Rogers is talking 

902
01:01:03,641 --> 01:01:08,641
about isn't objective truth.
And I suspect that at least in part 

903
01:01:08,641 --> 01:01:11,680
because establishing objective truth 
within the confines of a relationship is

904
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:16,690
I think it's technically impossible and 
we talked about that before because each

905
01:01:16,691 --> 01:01:21,691
interaction between the members of a 
couple or people in any relationship is 

906
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:26,380
contaminated in a sense by all of the 
other interactions they've ever had.

907
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,500
Plus everything they bring to bear on 
the situation and there's just no 

908
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,260
untangling that objectively know.
What did you mean when you said that

909
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,850
that well,
God,

910
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:40,190
you know,
you can argue about that for

911
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,650
to the point of divorce and for 10 years
afterwards,

912
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:48,870
you know,
without ever coming to a satisfactory 

913
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:48,870
conclusion.
All right?

914
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:51,210
The greatest greater the communicated 
congruence of experience,

915
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:53,580
awareness and behavior on the part of 
one individual.

916
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:58,820
The more the ensuing relationship will 
involve a tendency towards reciprocal 

917
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,400
communication with the same qualities.
Okay,

918
01:01:59,401 --> 01:02:02,220
so here's the idea.
You go see a psychotherapist,

919
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,770
a registered psychotherapist,
at least in principle.

920
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:10,100
This is someone who's mastered or is it 
tempting to master these basic modes of 

921
01:02:11,731 --> 01:02:16,731
being?
So what they're going to do is they'll 

922
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:17,340
tell you,
I'm going to tell you the truth as I see

923
01:02:17,341 --> 01:02:22,341
it.
And so the way I see that happening in 

924
01:02:22,341 --> 01:02:23,550
psychotherapy is that when someone comes
to see me,

925
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:29,090
I listened to them and that means that 
I'm not distracted by anything else.

926
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:32,940
I'm not thinking about anything else.
I'm not thinking about what I'm going to

927
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:33,750
say next.

928
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,630
I'm not thinking about the things I have
to do today.

929
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:40,830
I'm not thinking about the last time I 
saw this person.

930
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:45,831
I'm not allowing my attention to wander 
away from the person and then I'm 

931
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:51,441
watching them and listening to them at 
the same time and those are the same 

932
01:02:51,441 --> 01:02:52,920
things because to really listen to 
someone,

933
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:57,921
you also have to watch them because then
you succeed perhaps or perceive of the 

934
01:02:57,921 --> 01:03:00,390
nonverbal elements of communication that
go along with,

935
01:03:00,391 --> 01:03:01,650
well,
partly with voice tone,

936
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:06,651
but apparently with direction and partly
with very subtle transformations of 

937
01:03:06,651 --> 01:03:07,560
facial gesture.
So sometimes,

938
01:03:07,561 --> 01:03:12,561
for example,
I see on my clients that they'll all of 

939
01:03:12,561 --> 01:03:12,660
a sudden turn into a child.
It's very interesting.

940
01:03:12,661 --> 01:03:14,890
It's like there'll be recounting some 
experience.

941
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,070
It's like fixation from a Freudian 
perspective.

942
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:22,310
They'll be in,
there'll be describing some experience 

943
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,330
from the from the distant past and for a
second there expression will approximate

944
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,370
who they were when they were six years 
old.

945
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:31,520
It's really,
it's really something remarkable to see 

946
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,010
and you can see these things if you 
really pay attention and then as they 

947
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:34,440
talk,

948
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:43,340
I'm watching what's happening inside me 
as I listened to their words and all 

949
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:47,390
sorts of things will happen.
Sometimes I'll get an image or sometimes

950
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:52,391
I'll get a memory of something we talked
about before or sometimes I'll notice 

951
01:03:52,391 --> 01:03:56,871
that what they're saying right now is 
different than something they said five 

952
01:03:56,871 --> 01:03:56,940
minutes ago and so then I'll say,
wait a sec.

953
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:02,500
No,
I'm trying to understand what you're 

954
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,470
telling me and I noticed that you just 
said this and it seems to imply this,

955
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:05,700
but then,
you know,

956
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:07,950
a couple of minutes ago when we were 
talking about that,

957
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:12,951
then you said this and I don't see how 
those two things are the same and I'm 

958
01:04:12,951 --> 01:04:16,491
not doing that because I want them to 
rectify the paradox.

959
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:23,721
I'm doing that because I want to 
understand what they are saying and if 

960
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:24,090
someone says to you and then they say 
be.

961
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:29,090
You don't know what they're saying.
And so the question is for 

962
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:30,420
clarification.
There's no other direction than that.

963
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:34,140
And then maybe you know,
I'll have a little image,

964
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:36,180
like the sort of a fragment of a dream 
and I'll say,

965
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:36,980
wait a second,
what,

966
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,690
what you just said when you said what 
you just said,

967
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:44,691
this is what I experienced and then 
maybe we'll talk for awhile about what 

968
01:04:44,691 --> 01:04:45,960
that might mean and,
and I'll,

969
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,950
I can say to them what.
So for example,

970
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:54,951
sometimes sometimes people will come to 
my office and they do all sorts of 

971
01:04:54,951 --> 01:04:58,221
strange things.
Like I had one client who had 

972
01:04:58,221 --> 01:05:02,650
psychosomatic epilepsy and one of the 
first times I saw her,

973
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:08,140
she had a seizure in my office and uh,
I was watching her and it didn't really 

974
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:11,420
matter to me that she was having a 
seizure.

975
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:15,140
And I thought that's pretty weird 
because normally when someone's having a

976
01:05:15,141 --> 01:05:18,180
seizure,
it's like you get affected

977
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:18,810
by it,
right?

978
01:05:18,811 --> 01:05:23,811
I mean there's,
there's sensations that emerge in your 

979
01:05:23,811 --> 01:05:25,890
midsection and there's thoughts of 
emergency and,

980
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:31,360
and you know,
because your body in some sense is 

981
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,201
mimicking their body,
which is what your body does all the 

982
01:05:33,201 --> 01:05:34,150
time when you're talking to people.
And that produces a sense of urgency.

983
01:05:34,151 --> 01:05:37,110
And I just sort of watched her have the 
seizure and I thought,

984
01:05:37,111 --> 01:05:38,340
oh,
it's not real,

985
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:44,070
it's not real seizures,
but she was very good at it and you 

986
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:44,070
know,
as far as she was concerned,

987
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:48,891
she couldn't tell if the seizures were 
real or not and sometimes if you have 

988
01:05:48,891 --> 01:05:52,371
cycle genic epilepsy,
you've had an epileptic seizure at one 

989
01:05:52,371 --> 01:05:53,040
point that was genuine.
Well,

990
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:58,170
it's exceptionally complicated and it's 
not easy to develop a psychogenic 

991
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:02,211
epilepsy,
but she had developed it and part of the

992
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:03,260
reason was

993
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:10,620
that she thought that she was toying 
with the idea that existence as a 

994
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:15,121
psychiatric patient would require less 
effort and responsibility and so she got

995
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:20,431
tangled up at one point with one of the 
mental hospitals and they diagnosed her 

996
01:06:20,431 --> 01:06:22,630
with paranoid schizophrenia,
which is not something I would recommend

997
01:06:22,631 --> 01:06:27,631
it,
especially if you don't actually have 

998
01:06:27,631 --> 01:06:27,631
it.
Because once you've got the diagnosis,

999
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,490
well are you really going to know that 
you.

1000
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,710
What's going to happen?
Hey,

1001
01:06:31,711 --> 01:06:35,140
you do something like that.
You have a psychogenic epileptic seizure

1002
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:40,170
in a variety of other symptoms there.
The consequence of a very complex 

1003
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:46,710
complex in union terms,
there is a secondary motivation and 

1004
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:49,740
Freud in terms you go through with the 
whole routine anyway,

1005
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:53,410
end up in a psych hospital and you see 
for experts and they tell you a paranoid

1006
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:58,411
schizophrenia.
Do you really think you're going to not 

1007
01:06:58,411 --> 01:06:58,411
believe that or at least 10 percent of 
you is going to believe it.

1008
01:06:58,411 --> 01:07:03,370
You're going to wonder after that and if
another 20 people tell you that and 

1009
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:07,771
you're put on medication,
which you could easily be that a year 

1010
01:07:07,771 --> 01:07:08,770
later while you might still not have 
paranoid schizophrenia,

1011
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:10,450
but you are not going to be doing very 
well.

1012
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:11,830
So

1013
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:19,930
well.
That's a good example of what happens 

1014
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:21,701
when your self concept and you're 
organismic valuing systems aren't 

1015
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:26,171
working carefully in tandem anyways.
So someone might be telling me a story 

1016
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:28,770
that's,
you know,

1017
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:32,780
like a story about something terrible 
that happened to them and like I'll just

1018
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:37,520
be sitting there like a brick wall.
It's like you're not effecting me.

1019
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:39,020
And sometimes I'll tell people that.
It's like,

1020
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,060
I don't know why,
but you know,

1021
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:45,100
that's a pretty terrible story,
but I'm having no emotional response to 

1022
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:45,260
it at all.
Do you have any reason?

1023
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:49,040
You have any idea why that might be 
while then maybe look,

1024
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:54,250
you know,
often people are very happy when you 

1025
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:54,250
tell them that and that's fine.
They can be unhappy with that.

1026
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:58,691
That's perfectly okay,
but the thing is now they know that 

1027
01:07:58,691 --> 01:08:00,440
there's at least one person that they've
communicated with who's actually telling

1028
01:08:00,441 --> 01:08:05,441
them the truth,
who is actually not affected by their 

1029
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:08,120
story because look,
if someone sits down beside you and they

1030
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:13,121
tell you a terrible story,
the probability that you're going to 

1031
01:08:13,121 --> 01:08:16,421
tell them that that had no effect on you
is basically zero because really rude 

1032
01:08:16,421 --> 01:08:20,510
not to be negatively affected by someone
who's telling you a very sad story,

1033
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,530
but if you're negatively effected by it,
I just not true.

1034
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:29,530
You're not doing them any good at all.
You're doing is providing them with 

1035
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:32,321
evidence to maintain what could easily 
become a delusion if they worked on it 

1036
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:33,470
long enough.
By contrast,

1037
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:38,471
sometimes people will come into my 
office and they'll tell me something 

1038
01:08:38,471 --> 01:08:42,131
that just seems trivial and it made me 
tear up so which means I can actually 

1039
01:08:42,861 --> 01:08:45,500
feel emotions.
It would make me tear up,

1040
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:47,240
but it's just something they just 
barely.

1041
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:48,950
They barely alluded to.
You know,

1042
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:54,310
I got a client a while back told me that
we had had a session family session 

1043
01:08:54,681 --> 01:08:59,681
where I had suggested to some of the 
members of this person's family that 

1044
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:05,980
things might go better for them and 
their child who was one of my clients,

1045
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:12,820
if for the next two weeks what they 
practice doing was watching each other's

1046
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:18,761
behavior during the day and finding one 
thing that they could make a positive 

1047
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:21,350
comment about.

1048
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:26,530
Now,
and this isn't a game like if you play 

1049
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:26,530
it as a game,
then it isn't going to work.

1050
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:31,120
If you're going to do this properly,
what you do is you watch and then you 

1051
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,481
notice when the person does something 
that actually makes you feel positively 

1052
01:09:34,481 --> 01:09:36,890
towards them and then you tell them you 
did this.

1053
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,320
It has to be specific.
It can't be at the end of the day.

1054
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,580
Well,
you were pretty good today.

1055
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:41,600
It's like,
no,

1056
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:42,710
that's not gonna work,
man.

1057
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,110
You have to notice something.
They actually did.

1058
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,480
It's usually something trivial.
Like,

1059
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:53,060
um,
I really appreciate the fact that you 

1060
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:57,910
took your dirty dinner plate off the 
table and rinsed it off and put it in 

1061
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:58,130
the dishwasher.
It's like,

1062
01:09:58,131 --> 01:10:00,710
you think that's so damn trivial.
It's hardly worth commenting on.

1063
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:01,160
It's like,
no,

1064
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:01,670
no,
no.

1065
01:10:01,671 --> 01:10:06,671
It's not at all.
That's exactly the sort of specific 

1066
01:10:06,671 --> 01:10:06,671
thing that you comment on.

1067
01:10:06,671 --> 01:10:08,630
If it did in fact make you happy,
you know,

1068
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:10,280
when you can think about that in 
behavioral terms,

1069
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:11,180
you could say,
well if you,

1070
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:15,560
if,
if you want someone to do something that

1071
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:18,440
you like,
you should tell them when they do things

1072
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:21,230
that you like,
so that they know what you like.

1073
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,960
But of course that means that you're 
putting yourself on the line too,

1074
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:28,961
right?
Because if the person knows what you 

1075
01:10:28,961 --> 01:10:28,961
like,
then they can withhold it from you.

1076
01:10:28,961 --> 01:10:29,300
And so you're not going to do that 
unless you trust them.

1077
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,160
You're really not.
So you know,

1078
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:36,161
you might be in a relationship,
you might be in a marriage where never 

1079
01:10:36,161 --> 01:10:40,181
once during the whole bloody marriage do
you ever tell the other person what 

1080
01:10:40,181 --> 01:10:40,181
actually makes you happy?
It's like,

1081
01:10:40,181 --> 01:10:44,980
that's stupid by the way.
So like if you want to have a really 

1082
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:46,430
miserable time of it,
that's an excellent way to start.

1083
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:51,430
You could also add to that the 
presumption that if they really loved 

1084
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:51,430
you,
they know what you liked,

1085
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:56,200
which is also what your partners no 
smarter than you generally speaking and 

1086
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:02,180
you don't have a clue what it's going to
make them happy.

1087
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:03,950
So I don't know why you'd expect them 
to,

1088
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:09,100
especially if they're male,
why you'd expect them to return the 

1089
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,100
favor.
So then you teach them,

1090
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:12,140
you know,
like probably take four years.

1091
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:15,480
It's like I like when you do this and 
then of course they won't.

1092
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:17,460
So you might have to mention it again in
a month.

1093
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:22,461
You might think,
well it's going to take 18 months to 

1094
01:11:22,461 --> 01:11:22,461
train this person.
At least.

1095
01:11:22,461 --> 01:11:24,510
I mean they're smart,
they're smarter than a dog,

1096
01:11:24,511 --> 01:11:27,000
but not much smarter.
So you have to be,

1097
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:32,060
you have to use repetition and you have 
to be judicious about it and if you do 

1098
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,090
that,
another person is also doing that to you

1099
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,120
and you both know that you're doing that
and you're both trying to make things 

1100
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:38,880
better than you're going to communicate 
about it.

1101
01:11:38,881 --> 01:11:40,740
And then with any luck things will get 
better.

1102
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:43,530
But that means you actually have to want
things to get better.

1103
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,220
And that's part of the problem of 
course,

1104
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:52,221
because not everybody wants things to 
get better and there's a part of 

1105
01:11:52,221 --> 01:11:52,890
everyone that would be just as happy if 
they didn't get better.

1106
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:55,630
So anyways,

1107
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:02,680
Roger's idea is that if you communicate 
properly with the person that you're in 

1108
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:08,321
the relationship with,
that you can model proper being in some 

1109
01:12:08,321 --> 01:12:12,491
sense and that at least you could 
attempt tomorrow and then as you 

1110
01:12:12,491 --> 01:12:16,151
attempted,
you'll get better and better at it and 

1111
01:12:16,151 --> 01:12:16,151
as you get better at it,
the other person will get better at it.

1112
01:12:16,151 --> 01:12:20,930
And that works too.
So I had a client who was very anxious 

1113
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:22,760
person.
So when the person first came to see me,

1114
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,500
they couldn't even talk on the phone and
now they're doing,

1115
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,550
they're acting publicly,
they're acting in public.

1116
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:35,180
And that's been the consequence of about
seven years of,

1117
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:40,540
I would say Rogerian conversations were 
almost all that I did was listen now the

1118
01:12:44,091 --> 01:12:49,091
UNCW,
I don't quite get the unconditional 

1119
01:12:49,091 --> 01:12:51,671
positive regard thing,
although I know why Roger is set it and 

1120
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:55,181
his idea that arbitrary conditions of 
worth can make someone pathological or 

1121
01:12:55,181 --> 01:12:56,150
true,
but

1122
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:02,820
I think a more nuanced sense of 
unconditional positive regard is what 

1123
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,331
happens when you watch the person and 
they tell you something and as they're 

1124
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:09,151
telling it to you,
you can see a little part of them sort 

1125
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:12,241
of come alive and that often happens 
when their face loses a fair bit of its 

1126
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:17,191
rigidity and you can see more of what 
they were like when they were a child 

1127
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:18,370
sort of peeping through.
So their face sort of opens up.

1128
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:21,370
You can they a hot.
That was really good for that person.

1129
01:13:21,371 --> 01:13:26,371
Whatever they been telling me that 
they'd be doing that was right on the 

1130
01:13:26,371 --> 01:13:26,371
right track.
And then you can say,

1131
01:13:26,371 --> 01:13:27,610
look,
I noticed that when you talk about this,

1132
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:29,830
you know your,
your face redox,

1133
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,660
you didn't look as anxious,
you were smiling,

1134
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,670
you know,
and it was a genuine smile.

1135
01:13:33,671 --> 01:13:38,671
And for like a second or two there you 
look like you were doing well and you 

1136
01:13:38,671 --> 01:13:38,671
were happy.
It's like,

1137
01:13:38,671 --> 01:13:41,170
let's do a bunch more of that because 
you know,

1138
01:13:41,171 --> 01:13:44,260
if you see in someone that they're 
capable of experiencing that,

1139
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:48,040
then you could help them experience that
more.

1140
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,430
And that's the purpose of a longterm 
relationship

1141
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,570
is that

1142
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:58,790
you have your weaknesses and 
inadequacies and you can't think them,

1143
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:02,720
think yourself out of them by yourself,
partly because they colored the way that

1144
01:14:02,721 --> 01:14:07,721
you think.
And so you need somebody else to bang 

1145
01:14:07,721 --> 01:14:09,410
yourself up against,
to contend with so that all the knots in

1146
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:11,740
your soul can get ironed out and 
hypothetical.

1147
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:13,750
You're doing the same thing for the 
other person.

1148
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:16,000
And then both of you are on an upward 
spiral.

1149
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:21,010
And then in some sense that's the core 
theory of Rogerian psychotherapy.

1150
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:26,630
It's like genuine,
honest communication can heal people and

1151
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,540
genuinely dishonest communication can 
make them pathological.

1152
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:36,541
And in some sense,
I think Roger's got closer to the truth.

1153
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:44,310
If you invert Rogers presupposition,
that's as close to the truth as any 

1154
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,740
psychotherapists has gone to see,
makes people pathological.

1155
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,040
And that's true.
A lot of,

1156
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:56,041
and you'll notice this as well.
A lot of what you're doing in 

1157
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:56,800
psychotherapy and in any genuine 
relationship is a moral endeavor.

1158
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:02,640
You're trying to make things better.
And if the other person is deceiving 

1159
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:08,341
themselves or lying or failing to become
aware of things that they should become 

1160
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:12,271
aware of,
they're going to get bent and twisted 

1161
01:15:12,271 --> 01:15:12,271
out of shape and then they're not going 
to be congruent,

1162
01:15:12,271 --> 01:15:14,920
congruent with their body or with the 
broader world.

1163
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,010
And then they're going to suffer.
And then that will cascade.

1164
01:15:18,011 --> 01:15:19,610
Then all sorts of things will start to 
happen.

1165
01:15:19,611 --> 01:15:24,611
And you know,
that's the path to perdition and an 

1166
01:15:24,611 --> 01:15:24,611
involuntary trip to the underworld.

1167
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:31,350
When we meet again,
I think I'll show you a little clip of 

1168
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:34,180
Rogerian psychotherapy because a woman 
in the 19 fifties agreed to be filmed,

1169
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,580
