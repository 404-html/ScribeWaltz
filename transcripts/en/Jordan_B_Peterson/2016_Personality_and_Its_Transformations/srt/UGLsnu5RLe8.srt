1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,270
Well,
after all that,

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,980
so welcome to psychology to 30.
Nice to see you all here.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,440
So what I'm going to do today,
oh,

4
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:21,441
I'm going to start is I'm going to give 
you an overview of the content of the 

5
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:25,401
course and then I'll give you an 
overview of the class requirements right

6
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:28,170
at the end of.
I think we might as well jump right into

7
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:33,171
the content to begin with.
So there's a website,

8
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,140
I don't really like blackboard,
so I have my own website.

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,060
You can go to Jordan with Peter,
Jordan,

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,740
b Peterson,
dark palm and underneath there there's a

11
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:48,741
menu that lists all the courses and the 
full syllabus is listed there.

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,930
So all the information that you're going
to need about the course can be found 

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,720
there,
including most of the readings,

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,721
although there is also a textbook which 
I presumed a majority of you have 

15
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:03,651
already purchased.
So it also lists the other things that 

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,900
you need to know,
like what days the tests are going to be

17
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:11,700
and what the assignments are.
And I'll go over that anyways at the end

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,010
of the clocks.
So,

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,200
but to begin with,
I'm going to tell you what the course is

20
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,200
about so you can decide whether you're 
in the right class or not.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,520
So

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,590
personality is a somewhat peculiar field
of study in psychology because it spans 

23
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:40,541
a number of sub disciplines that aren't 
particularly well suited to one another,

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,520
so for example,
it spans clinical psychology and 

25
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,780
experimental psychology and it also 
spans and approach that is associated 

26
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:04,421
fundamentally with single individuals 
with an approach that analyzes 

27
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,990
individual characteristics in large 
groups,

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,140
which is generally what you have to do 
in experimental psychology.

29
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,460
It's also a relatively strange admixture
of philosophy and I would say 

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,700
engineering and medicine as well as 
science and you might think of medicine 

31
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:34,511
as a science,
but it's not and the reason that it's 

32
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:38,081
not as because it's concerned with the 
promotion of health and health is not a 

33
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:42,101
scientific category.
It's a category that can't help but be 

34
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:44,600
value-laden because you have to decide 
what constitutes health,

35
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,660
health and what constitutes illness or 
what constitutes wellness and what 

36
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,501
constitutes pathology and there's no way
you can do that without bringing value 

37
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:53,660
judgments into the equation.

38
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,140
It's particularly true in psychology 
because when you're thinking about what 

39
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,761
a healthy might be,
you generally don't merely think in 

40
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,621
terms of the absence of pathology.
You think in terms of the presence of 

41
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:07,810
positive traits,
right,

42
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,720
and someone who's fully healthy mentally
and physically.

43
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,870
While the psychologists,
especially the humanistic psychologists 

44
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,070
from the sixties might consider someone 
who's truly psychologically healthy,

45
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:23,071
self actualized,
which would mean in some sense that 

46
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,850
they've been able to develop the 
entirety of their positive potential,

47
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,970
whatever that is.
So because of these peculiarities,

48
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,330
personality psychology,
the course of course in personality 

49
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:36,580
psychology has to be pretty wide 
ranging.

50
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,350
And so this course is in fact wide 
ranging.

51
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:40,830
It,
it,

52
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,250
it brings in elements of cultural 
history,

53
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,790
um,
elements of moral philosophy and then 

54
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,980
elements that I would consider almost 
completely biological.

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,820
And it does that in order to provide you
with a multidimensional view of what it 

56
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,900
means to be a human being.

57
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,440
I have some other principles that I 
abide by while I'm teaching this course 

58
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,341
as well.
And one of those is that I don't really 

59
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:14,341
want to tell you about anything that I 
don't think you will find useful and 

60
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:16,930
useful,
like there's a difference between a fact

61
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:18,280
and a useful fact,
right?

62
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,340
There's lots of facts.
You can go on Google and you can drown 

63
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,340
yourself in facts.
I'm sure you do that every day,

64
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,950
but a useful fact to me is one that 
transforms the way that you look at the 

65
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,841
world or the way that you act in the 
world in some manner that you find 

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,580
beneficial.
And so another way of,

67
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,930
of describing useful from that 
perspective is relevant.

68
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:44,440
And so one of the principles I abide by 
is that I don't really want to teach you

69
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:49,441
anything that isn't relevant and my 
criteria for relevant is first isn't 

70
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,810
going to make a difference to you 
personally.

71
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:57,811
So are the things that you learn 
immediately meaningful to how you 

72
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,230
interact with the world.
And then the second is,

73
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,440
is there some evidence that the facts 
that you're going to be,

74
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,030
that you're going to be presented with 
actually have some social utility or 

75
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,710
some political utility or some economic 
utility.

76
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:13,711
So that the fact that you know them 
makes a difference to the way that you 

77
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,460
act in a way that also affects the 
people around you.

78
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,320
And so

79
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,990
it's for those multiple reasons that I 
brought together the material that I 

80
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,831
have brought together now that means 
that there's some factors that you have 

81
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:32,490
to take into account

82
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,410
before you take this course.
And there's another personality course 

83
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,130
being given at exactly the same time,
like,

84
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,260
well,
I don't this semester anyways.

85
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,900
And so it may be that that one's more 
suitable for you to network.

86
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:51,170
I don't know,
but I can tell you what this one is 

87
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,330
going to be like.
And so if that isn't what you want or if

88
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:56,331
that's not what you're interested in,
then you probably shouldn't take this 

89
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:56,760
course.
So the first issue is that there's a lot

90
00:05:56,761 --> 00:06:01,761
of,
there isn't as much reading as there 

91
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,280
used to be in this course by the way.
Um,

92
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,420
but there's still a lot of reading and a
lot of its original source material,

93
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,400
both from the personality theorists 
themselves and then also original source

94
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:18,401
material from empirical papers.
So I would say that not only is there a 

95
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:22,631
lot of reading,
but the readings actually quite 

96
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:22,631
difficult.

97
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:25,600
Um,
I think it's useful given the way I 

98
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,871
already defined utility to you.
And so I believe that reading what I 

99
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:30,470
present to you is going to be good for 
you,

100
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,860
but if you don't have time to do a lot 
of reading,

101
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,140
then you're going to find this course 
frustrating.

102
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,370
So there's also because of the emphasis 
on clinical theoreticians,

103
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,910
which is a major part of personality 
theory,

104
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:50,420
especially the more classical 
personality theory,

105
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:53,570
which by the way is generally the 
elements of personality theory that most

106
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:56,270
students are most interested in.
Um,

107
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,720
there's a lot of what I would consider 
philosophical material and the reason 

108
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,150
it's philosophical is because it's 
concerned with how a person should live.

109
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,140
And that's a much different question 
than what a person is.

110
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,560
So it's how a person should live or 
perhaps how a person might transform 

111
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,600
themselves or act in order to transform 
themselves so that their personality is,

112
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,160
well,
for lack of a better word,

113
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,180
better now you can substitute healthier 
for better.

114
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,360
But in a context like the one we're 
discussing,

115
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:31,361
the difference is trivial really.
So then the last thing that I would 

116
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:37,031
caution you against is that I don't 
lecture from the reading material so 

117
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,870
often.
I'm not exactly sure even what I'm going

118
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:45,410
to tell you when I come to class.
I know the material,

119
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,270
but I don't want to stick to a 
prescribed beltline.

120
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,570
I want to talk to you about the things 
that I think are important and so with 

121
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,820
luck that'll make the lectures worth 
attending and worth listening to.

122
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,360
But if you're more inclined from a 
temperamental perspective,

123
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,420
do you want it a course where things are
laid out in a very orderly fashion and 

124
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,141
they progress in a linear fashion and 
it's predictable and the lectures 

125
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:16,280
reflect the reading material,
then this is not a good course for you.

126
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,450
And so I would presume that would be the
case if you're orderly.

127
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,050
And by the way,
that's one of the subdivisions of the 

128
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,481
big five personality trait model.
An orderly people tend to be 

129
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:32,950
conscientious,
but they like things cut and dried and 

130
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,100
laid out in linear fashion.
Um,

131
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,160
I'm not that orderly.
I'm higher in openness and openness is a

132
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:42,161
creative dimension and open people tend 
to use relatively loose,

133
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,510
loose associations when they speak and 
to cover a wide amount of territory.

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,080
And so some people would like that.
If you like reading literature for 

135
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,310
example,
you probably liked this course.

136
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,630
If you don't,
then you probably won't.

137
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,770
So

138
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,720
anyways,
that's pretty much enough for the 

139
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:05,720
warnings.
So,

140
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,321
uh,
now I'll tell you what we're going to 

141
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:11,241
talk about.
One of the things that makes human 

142
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:14,310
beings unique

143
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,820
is the fact that we're self conscious.
Now,

144
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,750
you'll see ecologists are people who 
study animal behavior,

145
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,980
do relatively elementary tests of self 
consciousness on animals.

146
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,560
So one of the most famous demonstrations
of such self consciousness is the mirror

147
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:37,870
test.
And so in the mirror test,

148
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:39,850
what you essentially do is you take an 
animal,

149
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,120
maybe a chimp or maybe a three year old 
child,

150
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,530
and you put a lipstick mark on their 
forehead or on their nose,

151
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,590
and then you show them a reflection of 
themselves in the mirror.

152
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,180
And if they wipe off,
or Jeff,

153
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:58,181
you're towards the lipstick mark,
then you can make the presumption that 

154
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,280
they understand that it's them that's 
being reflected in the mirror,

155
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,940
or at least they understand that well 
enough so that they can use the mirror 

156
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,781
as a guide to action with their with 
their hand or or whatever it is that 

157
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:13,180
they happen to be pointing with,
and the reflection now,

158
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,340
dolphin seemed to be able to manage 
that.

159
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,250
There some members of the core of the 
family.

160
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,490
So those are basically crows and ravens.
Those things are really smart and they 

161
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,541
seem to possess rudimentary 
selfconsciousness said dolphins 

162
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,810
citations in general.
So whales,

163
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:32,290
although I don't know if all whales are 
self conscious because it's,

164
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,660
for example,
difficult to get a mirror and big enough

165
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:35,620
to show a blue whale

166
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:43,160
human beings.
That's about it.

167
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,060
No,
I don't think that's a very good 

168
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,201
definition of self consciousness really.
Because the mere fact that you can 

169
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,800
recognize yourself and it's also not 
fair to some animals like dogs,

170
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:55,430
right?
Because dog would need a smell of mirror

171
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,480
really because.
And most animals are very,

172
00:10:57,481 --> 00:11:02,481
very smell predicated.
Most of the brain is structured with the

173
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,420
olfactory system as its core,
unlike us really because our brains are 

174
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,560
structured with the visual system at the
core and that makes us rather peculiar,

175
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:15,561
but it's a little unfair to animals like
dogs and rats that relied primarily on 

176
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,310
olfaction to orient themselves in the 
world.

177
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:22,311
But the thing is I don't think that's 
really a very good definition of self 

178
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:22,770
consciousness.
It's very rudimentary.

179
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:23,400
You might say,
well,

180
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:28,401
that's the first sort of step to being 
self conscious because if you're fully 

181
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:31,230
self conscious,
I think you need two more things.

182
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,260
You need the capacity to imitate,
which is a much more important capacity 

183
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,700
than people generally realize.
In fact,

184
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:42,630
I would say it's a equivalent 
importance.

185
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,940
It's of equivalent importance to 
language.

186
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,120
In fact,
I'm not even sure that you could use 

187
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,120
language if you can't imitate.
First of all,

188
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,250
obviously all the words you used are 
also the words that other people use.

189
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,530
Otherwise,
you're not going to be very 

190
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,511
comprehensible,
so even the mere fact that you do speak 

191
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,690
means that you're relying on invitation 
to get your point across.

192
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,400
So you need an invitation and the reason
you need invitation is because once you 

193
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,701
can imitate,
you can use your body as a 

194
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:14,761
representational structure to represent 
the world and other people you can even 

195
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:17,740
use your body as a representational 
structure to represent yourself,

196
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,390
which you might do,
for example,

197
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:22,690
if you're telling a joke at a dinner 
party and then you know,

198
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,810
act out of self parody and everyone 
likes so.

199
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:32,310
And then with regards to language,
well language obviously enables you to 

200
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,581
build sophisticated models of the world 
that are well articulated to exchange 

201
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,330
those with other people and to think,
okay,

202
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:42,331
so in order to be self conscious you 
have to be able to recognize that you 

203
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:45,760
exist in this physical envelope,
at least here and now.

204
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,020
You need to be able to imitate because 
that's partly how you come to understand

205
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,200
yourself and other creatures like you,
which is a very important part of being 

206
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,390
self conscious.
Right?

207
00:12:55,391 --> 00:13:00,391
I mean everything I learned about any of
you is also going to help me understand 

208
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:03,100
the sort of creature that I am,
whether that's for good or for evil.

209
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,030
And then with language,
well not only can we articulate our 

210
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,300
representations about each other in the 
world,

211
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:14,530
but we can also store those articulated 
representations over very,

212
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:15,160
very,
very,

213
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:20,161
very long spans of time and we do that 
partly in ritual which is the acting out

214
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:21,970
of a representation.

215
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,090
And we do that partly with regards to 
stories which are in some sense and 

216
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,980
articulated representation of an acting 
out,

217
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,340
right?
Because you can think of a story as a 

218
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,651
drama.
So drama is behavior representing 

219
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:41,281
behavior.
And then the story is an articulated 

220
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:43,921
representation of a drama.
Now we have very old rituals and we have

221
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,950
very,
very old stories and so part of what we 

222
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,931
do in this course as we go back to as 
close to the beginning as we can 

223
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:58,171
possibly manage to start to understand 
how people have understood themselves 

224
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,840
and represented themselves across the 
span of human history.

225
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,560
And we're doing that because we want to 
be able to put our current knowledge in 

226
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,360
some kind of historical context.
And part of the reason for that is,

227
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,760
well,
one of the things that characterizes the

228
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,470
human personality is that it's a 
historical phenomenon.

229
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,100
You know,
I'm sure you've heard in many classes 

230
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,850
that much of what makes up your 
personality is a cultural construct.

231
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,180
Well,
whether or not much of it is or not 

232
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,341
isn't really the issue.
Certainly some of it is an important 

233
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:35,071
part.
You're a cultural creature and that 

234
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:37,351
means that you have emerged within a 
tradition that's been shaped and in any 

235
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:41,881
number of ways by an extraordinarily 
lengthy historical past or historical 

236
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:46,951
and biological.
And so what that means in part is that 

237
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:50,310
if you don't understand your history,
and that's your history as it matters,

238
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,330
not necessarily some collection of 
facts,

239
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,780
then you don't understand yourself.
So,

240
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:04,781
you know,
human beings in their self conscious 

241
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:04,781
form,
we don't really know how old we are,

242
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,570
more or less biologically or genetically
identical creatures to us existed at 

243
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,290
least 150,000
years ago.

244
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,830
But we seem to have discovered fire and 
were able to master it maybe 2 million 

245
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:19,380
years ago,
you know.

246
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,530
And that required a fair bit of 
intelligence.

247
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,860
Um,
and there are,

248
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,950
there are artifacts that indicate a fair
high level of,

249
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,960
of cultural capacity that are at least 
50,000

250
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:35,090
years old.
So we can't really say when,

251
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,870
when we got fully self conscious and 
perhaps we might also say that we're not

252
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,940
even fully self conscious yet because 
you know,

253
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,010
really what the hell do you know about 
yourself?

254
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,060
You know,
you're really,

255
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:44,750
really,
really,

256
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:49,751
really complicated.
And at best you have a partial model of 

257
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,780
who you are and that thing fails all the
time,

258
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,810
which as you can tell,
because you're always doing things that 

259
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,420
surprise you and often not in a 
particularly positive way.

260
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,590
So there's no end of mystery.
Anyways.

261
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,790
The upshot of all this is that we're 
going to establish the context first.

262
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,390
That's a historical context and I want 
to do that two ways.

263
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,400
The first thing I want to do is to talk 
to you about mythological 

264
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,970
representations of personality,
and that's more important than you might

265
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:21,590
think.
In fact,

266
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:23,240
it's probably more important than you do
think.

267
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,890
I'm by myth.
What I mean is the representations of 

268
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:34,721
human beings in extremely long lasting 
and persistent stories.

269
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,890
And so some of those are the stories 
that are found in various religious 

270
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,311
traditions,
but there's oral traditions that 

271
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,981
surround those religious traditions just
assuming that the religious traditions 

272
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:51,491
are written down and there's fairy tales
and that sort of thing and standard 

273
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:55,631
narratives that people use to guide 
themselves as they move through the 

274
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:59,921
world,
and most of the clinical theories that 

275
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:04,571
we're going to discuss,
so Freud's theory and theory and the 

276
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:07,550
theory of the existentialists and the 
phenomenologists in the humanists and so

277
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:12,551
forth,
are variance of those mythological 

278
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:12,551
stories.
Now,

279
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:14,000
part of the reason for that is that 
neat.

280
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:19,170
You said once that a philosopher was 
seldom anything other than the 

281
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,090
unconscious advocate of their cultural 
worldview.

282
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,290
So what he meant by that was you already
come to the scene with a set of 

283
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,410
presuppositions.
Now,

284
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:32,210
some of those are embedded in your 
behavior.

285
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,620
So for example,
when you walk,

286
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,020
when you attend a funeral,
you know how to behave.

287
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,670
He generally,
you're quiet and solemn.

288
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,180
You might not be able to explicate the 
rules that a person should follow at a 

289
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,210
funeral,
but you can do it now.

290
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,770
You could perhaps articulate them press,
but it's not like you're following those

291
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,310
rules.
You go to a funeral,

292
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,950
you just know what to do.
If someone pressed you,

293
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,951
you could turn it into a list of rules,
but it's really more encoded in your 

294
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,900
actual behavior.
You just automatically know what to do.

295
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,430
You can tell when you ever.

296
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,980
You interact with someone who's really 
socially fluent,

297
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
you can tell that they're not 
consciously processing the way that 

298
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,751
they're acting.
Otherwise they're self conscious and 

299
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:14,751
awkward.
They're just very fluid.

300
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,460
It's automatized behavior and it's coded
right into them.

301
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,640
So if you're a great philosopher,
then according to Nietzsche,

302
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,300
at least what you do is you take a look 
and how you act and what you think,

303
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,680
and then you say,
well,

304
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:30,681
this is what it's like.
It's not so much that you're inventing 

305
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,550
new ideas.
It's that you're articulating the nature

306
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:35,310
of structures that are already there.
So you can imagine,

307
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:40,311
for example,
imagine that you're particularly 

308
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:43,521
interested in wolves and so you studied 
some wolves and one of the things you 

309
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:45,900
see is that the wolves have a dominance 
hierarchy.

310
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:50,901
So there's,
there's a leader and then there is 

311
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:52,470
struggle in the pack to see who's going 
to be the dominant leader.

312
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,290
Now there's a couple of problems with 
that,

313
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,170
which is that,
you know,

314
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:02,180
if we'll fail and we'll be fight and 
they're pretty evenly matched and they 

315
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,811
tear each other to shreds,
then we'll see is going to come in and 

316
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,781
pound both of them.
And that's not a particularly useful 

317
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,601
strategy for welfare for Wolf B plus.
Then the pack loses the power of Wolf 

318
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:14,580
and wolf be.
And so that's hard to useful at all.

319
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,850
So what's happened is that wolves have 
evolved dominance and submission 

320
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,661
strategies so that they can figure out 
who is going to leave and who is going 

321
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:27,420
to follow without having to engage in 
the kind of physical combat that's going

322
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:32,421
to result in damage.
And so usually what happens is that the 

323
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:36,141
two wolves face off,
you've probably seen cats do this when 

324
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:36,141
they encounter each other,
you know,

325
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:40,771
other on the street,
the first thing they do is sort of 

326
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:40,771
turned sideways and they puff themselves
up,

327
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:40,771
right?

328
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:42,150
And they dance back and forth.
It's quite comical.

329
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,360
But what the caps trying to do is look 
back and exposed to try and make the 

330
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,051
other cat nervous enough to leave.
And so what was do is roughly the same 

331
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:55,791
thing they puff out so they look big and
they make all sorts of ferocious noises 

332
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,210
and they threaten each other.
And usually what happens is one wolf 

333
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,570
will lose his nerve,
flopped down,

334
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:01,860
roll over,
show his throat,

335
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:04,800
and that basically means something like 
I'm useless and,

336
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,830
and you know,
and pathetic and you can tear out my 

337
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
throat if you want because of that.
And the other wolf.

338
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:10,560
Thanks.
Yeah,

339
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,080
you are pretty useful and pathetic,
but you know,

340
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,760
we're going to need you tomorrow to hunt
down a deer so you know,

341
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,750
you can get up and protect your 
miserable self and that'll be okay.

342
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,600
Now,
if you were watching that,

343
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:25,980
you might say we'll just follow rules,
but of course they don't.

344
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,360
That's just how wolves,
Zach,

345
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,850
when you describe what the wells are 
doing,

346
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,550
then you turn it into a rule.
But it wasn't a rule to begin with.

347
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:34,320
It was just a pattern of behavior.
Now,

348
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:39,321
human beings are like that were chalked 
full of patterns of behavior and 

349
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,590
they're,
they're,

350
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,950
they're the consequences of our biology,
which is something we'll talk about in 

351
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,130
depth in the last half of the course,
and there are consequence of our culture

352
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,650
and they're built into our bodies.
Like every,

353
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,810
every time you interact with another 
person,

354
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,660
they're telling you how to behave,
right?

355
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,740
Don't be too obtuse.
Try to be a little bit witty,

356
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,670
have something interesting to say.
Don't be too annoying if you're going to

357
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:05,740
say something funny,
make sure it's funny.

358
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,770
Take turns while you talk.
Play nicely,

359
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,170
take your turn.
Don't eat all the bread,

360
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,400
et Cetera,
et cetera.

361
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,880
You know,
and so if you don't abide by those 

362
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,560
rules,
then people lift their eyebrow at you or

363
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:25,561
they don't smile at your jokes are they 
don't look at you or they roll their 

364
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:28,561
eyes when you come in,
which is really not a good sign by the 

365
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:30,640
way,
and you get punished severely for it.

366
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,100
And then if you do act like they would 
like you to act,

367
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:34,850
you know,
then people smile at you and they're,

368
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,200
they invite you to their place for 
dinner and you know,

369
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,060
maybe you have an intimate relationship 
and some people that like you.

370
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:45,330
And so we're exchanging information 
about how we should manifest ourselves 

371
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,010
in our bodies with every possible 
interaction.

372
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,020
And what that means is that shapes the 
way that we act.

373
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:56,060
Now the problem is or partly is that you
don't really understand the consequences

374
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:57,230
of that.
Like you,

375
00:21:57,231 --> 00:22:02,231
you can act it out more or less 
depending on your social skill and the 

376
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:02,290
degree to which you've been exposed to 
other people.

377
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,560
But that doesn't mean you're a conscious
that you have that.

378
00:22:05,561 --> 00:22:08,800
You can consciously articulate all the 
rules that underlie that.

379
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,260
And if you think that maybe you can,
well fine.

380
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:15,020
You know,
imagine a well behaved four year old,

381
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,870
you know,
by four,

382
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,320
you've got a lot of the social rules 
down because by four you can play with 

383
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,260
others if you're ever going to be able 
to.

384
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,930
You can already do it by the time you,
for.

385
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,940
If you can't,
by the time you were four,

386
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,150
you are in serious trouble because other
kids won't play with you and then they 

387
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,661
won't teach you how to act,
and then you stay immature and isolated 

388
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:39,931
and you know often your little corner 
dejected and bitter for the rest of your

389
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:45,781
life.
Now you might think that's a little 

390
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:45,781
rough,
but it's not.

391
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:45,781
That's what the.
That's what the data indicate.

392
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,800
So.
So anyways,

393
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,370
what this means in part is,
well,

394
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:57,390
we've been shaping how all of us behave 
as long as we've been social.

395
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,760
Now you might say,
well,

396
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:03,370
how long have we been social?
Well,

397
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,620
crustaceans are social.
So lobsters for example,

398
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,320
organize themselves into dominance 
hierarchies and they modify each other's

399
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:17,770
behavior.
And that's $400 million years.

400
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,430
So we've been social and living in 
groups since our ancestors departed on 

401
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:31,030
the evolutionary timescale from the 
ancestors of lobsters.

402
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,110
So that's very,
very,

403
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:37,111
very long time.
There weren't any trees around back 

404
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:40,000
there.
So social life is older than trees,

405
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,080
so you can be sure that you're adapted 
to it in a major way.

406
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,620
So it's built into your biology.
But then there's the historical element 

407
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,300
of it too,
and it's quite.

408
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,150
We're quite flexible from a cultural 
perspective.

409
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:57,420
So there's an example skier named Robert
Sapolsky,

410
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,790
who I really like.
He's a great scientist.

411
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,480
He went off to Africa to study baboons.
Baboons are not pleasant generally 

412
00:24:06,451 --> 00:24:08,220
speaking there.
They fight a lot.

413
00:24:08,221 --> 00:24:09,420
They're bullies.
They bite.

414
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,450
They can really bite at that boom,
like a predatory cat will think twice 

415
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,190
about taking on and by mood.
They've got major teeth and their.

416
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,100
Their temperament is not particularly 
positive.

417
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,630
Supposedly went and studied a group of 
baboons and they were engaged in typical

418
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,640
baboons,
gang behavior,

419
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:31,790
harassing each other all the time and 
bullying each other and they're all 

420
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,281
stressed out because he knew that 
because he measured their levels of 

421
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:37,701
stress and their testosterone and so 
forth and so it was pretty miserable 

422
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:38,820
baboons existence.
But then what happened was that

423
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,190
the baboons went to feed somewhere that 
I don't remember and they,

424
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,280
a lot of them contracted tuberculosis 
and it turned out that almost all the 

425
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,171
hyper aggressive males got tuberculosis 
and died and all that was left was the 

426
00:24:54,171 --> 00:24:57,981
Beta males roughly speaking.
And then the whole book by building 

427
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:01,190
culture transformed so that it became 
much more agreeable and much more 

428
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,401
cooperative.
And then when aggressive baboons would 

429
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:04,401
move into that territory,
you know,

430
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:08,040
singly or their own,
then they'd get all placid and calm too.

431
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,640
So it's interesting gay because 
obviously baboons aren't social to the 

432
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,421
degree that we are,
but it does indicate that even at the 

433
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:18,060
advanced primate level,
you know,

434
00:25:18,061 --> 00:25:20,100
their brains are pretty big but not as 
big as ours.

435
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,840
But cultural transmission of behavior 
expectation can be quite powerful and it

436
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:28,800
can transform quite rapidly.
So anyways,

437
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:31,110
we've been shaping each other's behavior
for a very,

438
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:31,800
very,
very,

439
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:32,850
very long time.

440
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,570
And a lot of that is encoded deeply in 
biology and in culture.

441
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,960
Now,
biologically,

442
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,930
when we'll talk about this a lot,
when we get to the biological section,

443
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,500
one of the ways that you can know how 
social you are is by noting how hurt and

444
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:51,390
ashamed you get.
If you make a serious social error.

445
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,960
You know.
So if you're at a party and you make a 

446
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:56,960
fool of yourself,
you know,

447
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,260
depending on your level of neuroticism,
which is also a big five trait,

448
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,170
that index is how sensitive you are to 
negative emotion.

449
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,620
You might obsess about what an idiot you
are for the next three or four months or

450
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:06,920
maybe even for the next five years.
You know,

451
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:11,930
people do not like social exclusion.
You know when you have a little counter 

452
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:15,960
that's more or less built into the back 
of your brain that roughly,

453
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,810
first of all estimates how successful 
you are.

454
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,770
There's an estimation that actually 
seems to occur right at birth where when

455
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,800
part of your neuroticism levels are set,
and then that can be modified to some 

456
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,740
degree by learning,
you know,

457
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:33,741
and if you're a talk baboons,
well you're going to experience less 

458
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:37,290
negative emotion and more satisfaction 
than you are if you're a bottom baboons.

459
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:39,870
And it's exactly the same with people.
So,

460
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:44,871
you know,
we like to be climbing up dominance 

461
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:47,781
hierarchies.
We'd like to be near the top of 

462
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:49,521
dominance hierarchies.
And if the little counter out the back 

463
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:51,891
of your brain notices that you know 
you're doing a good job of climbing 

464
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:52,590
towards the top of irrelevant dominance 
hierarchy,

465
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,830
then it's going to produce more 
serotonin and you're not going to be as 

466
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,200
in as much pain,
you're not going to be as depressed,

467
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:03,201
you're not going to be as anxious,
you're not going to be stressed and so 

468
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:03,201
forth.

469
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:07,400
So,
so there's a biological basis for our 

470
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,611
social being and it's extraordinarily 
important to us how we fit into social 

471
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:10,611
groups.
Okay.

472
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:15,321
So we've also been trying to figure out 
what the hell we are,

473
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:19,290
who we are for thousands and thousands 
of years.

474
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,770
Partly as a consequence of invitation,
you know,

475
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,370
because I can act you out and it'll sort
of help me understand what you're like.

476
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,670
And partly as a consequence of 
articulated communication loader that 

477
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,140
storytelling now people have been 
telling stories for.

478
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,230
We have no idea how long.
I mean if you go and visit peoples that 

479
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,181
have no written language and who'd been 
isolated from the rest of human society 

480
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:48,741
for say,
tens of thousands of years and such 

481
00:27:48,741 --> 00:27:48,960
people still exist.
You find that they tell stories,

482
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,760
they danced,
they act each other out,

483
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:54,600
you know,
so we know certainly that the propensity

484
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:59,601
to tell stories and to engage in ritual 
behavior is far older than our ability 

485
00:27:59,601 --> 00:27:59,601
to write.

486
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,420
I suspect you could push it back at 
least 50,000

487
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:05,340
years.
Although I suspect it's a lot older than

488
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:10,341
that.
And so what's happened is that across 

489
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:13,910
those sorts of timescales,
we've started to tell stories about one 

490
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,820
another that represent how we act.
And then you might think,

491
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:22,821
well,
some of those stories are interesting 

492
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:24,441
and memorable and some of them aren't.
And then we tend to remember the 

493
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:25,140
interesting and memorable ones and pass 
them on.

494
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,680
And so you can also imagine human beings
aggregating together in groups of 

495
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,460
thousands and thousands of people over 
thousands and thousands of years telling

496
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:40,461
their stories to one another and 
hammering those stories into some sort 

497
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:42,600
of mutually acceptable and 
comprehensible for.

498
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,900
And so for example,
one example of that is that if you look 

499
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,021
at the creation stories,
the creation story that say occurs in 

500
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:54,291
Genesis in the Old Testament,
it's a member of a class of creation 

501
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:58,701
stories that characterized Middle 
Eastern mythology and it seems to have 

502
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:03,831
arisen out of the organization,
have separate Middle Eastern tribes 

503
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:08,031
thousands and thousands of years ago,
each with their own traditions into a 

504
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:11,541
relatively homogenous story that 
characterized a large group of people,

505
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,170
central beliefs.

506
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,100
So we have information about how we act 
from the representations that we've made

507
00:29:21,211 --> 00:29:26,211
of those actions that we passed forward.
And Lot of those take the form of miss 

508
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,750
religious stories.
And so part of what we're going to do is

509
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:35,751
we're going to begin the course with two
foundation establishing themes.

510
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,500
One has to do with the structure of 
mythological representations and the 

511
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:48,421
second has to do with a set of rituals 
and processes and beliefs that have been

512
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:54,730
identified more or less worldwide that 
have to do with shamonic transformation.

513
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:00,570
Now,
the title of this course is personality 

514
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,061
and its transformations.
And the reason it's titled that way is 

515
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:05,881
because you aren't just who you are.
You're also something that changes all 

516
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:11,501
the time.
You're more like a river than like a 

517
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:11,501
rock.
You're constantly transforming.

518
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,320
The physicist.
Erwin Schrodinger thought that people 

519
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,290
were dissipative structures.
It's a very interesting idea.

520
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:25,291
So a dissipative structure is a 
structure that maintains its structural 

521
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:25,620
integrity.
Well,

522
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:28,900
it's elements transformed completely.
So you know,

523
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:33,130
when you let the water out of the sake,
you get a whirlpool and the whirlpool is

524
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,890
a fairly stable entity.
But the water that the whirlpool is made

525
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:37,180
of,
it's constantly changing.

526
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,090
That's a dissipative structures.
Well that's what you're like.

527
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:45,270
You maintain your form across time,
but your elements are constantly 

528
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,500
transforming and people are very,
very transformative creatures.

529
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,760
You know,
we can,

530
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,140
unlike animals,
because animals are sort of what they 

531
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:56,140
are.
And that's it.

532
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,200
I mean they have some capacity learned,
but not very much.

533
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,500
Your typical beaver is acting more like 
more or less today.

534
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:01,850
Like you know,
his great,

535
00:31:01,851 --> 00:31:02,480
great,
great,

536
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:05,030
great grandfather was acting 5,000
years ago.

537
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,740
There's no real accretion of culture.
Whereas with human beings,

538
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,600
we transformed like mad.
I mean we do that culturally,

539
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,730
things aren't much.
There's so many things,

540
00:31:16,731 --> 00:31:21,731
for example,
that are different now than there were 

541
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:22,190
20 years ago that it's almost impossible
to manage it and then so we transform on

542
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:25,280
a cultural scale quite rapidly,
but we also do that individually.

543
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,580
I mean,
you guys have all just made the 

544
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:30,580
transition to university.
Just roughly speaking,

545
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,950
you know,
I'm sure that your like you were in some

546
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:35,870
ways when you were in high school,
but well,

547
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,090
hopefully you're better than you were in
high school.

548
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,000
A whole bunch of ways as well.
You should be more mature,

549
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,580
but your personality may have 
transformed substantially.

550
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You know,
and with any luck you're not done with 

551
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,941
your sequences of transformations.
You know that's going to be something 

552
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:55,811
that characterizes you for the rest of 
your life in so far as you're a dynamic 

553
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:56,230
person,
your eyes are open,

554
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,730
you pay attention,
you and you can learn.

555
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,210
And so one of the things you might say 
is that the most stable thing there is 

556
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,080
about human personality is its capacity 
to transform.

557
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,570
And that's really something that's worth
knowing,

558
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,910
you know,
because one of the things I can tell you

559
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:15,911
about the great myths of mankind,
there's lots of them and they have 

560
00:32:15,911 --> 00:32:19,481
different themes.
One of the most powerful themes is the 

561
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,970
way you get yourself out of trouble is 
to transform your personality.

562
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,690
Now you think you kind of do that every 
time you learn something,

563
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,010
right?

564
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,710
Because you learn something in your 
little different than you were before,

565
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,740
hopefully different in a significant way
and hopefully different in a way that 

566
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,010
helps you solve some problems that you 
couldn't solve before.

567
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,600
So you could say one of the late motifs 
of being human is,

568
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,640
well,
if I were to encounter an obstacle,

569
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:46,370
I can just transform and I can figure 
out some way of getting around it.

570
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,100
And that's something that makes us quite
remarkable.

571
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,620
No one.
One of the things that I could suggest 

572
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,110
to you and I,
I think this is one of the largest ideas

573
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,670
that exist especially communicable in 
this short time,

574
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:06,671
is that it's much better to identify 
with your capacity to transform than it 

575
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:09,140
is to identify with who you are.
Now.

576
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,290
And that can get you out of an awful lot
of trouble.

577
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,470
I mean,
one of the things that characterizes 

578
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:17,470
video logs,
for example,

579
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,201
or people who are trapped in fixed 
belief systems is that they worship who 

580
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:24,131
they are now and that'd be all fine if 
everything was going 100 percent for 

581
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:24,740
them,
but it's seldom the case.

582
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,460
And so unless your life is perfect and 
that seems highly improbable,

583
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,940
maybe if you were someone else,
it would be better.

584
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:38,050
And you know,
that's all you've got in some sense 

585
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,181
because changing the world in some way 
that's going to make you feel better 

586
00:33:40,181 --> 00:33:40,490
about it.
Well,

587
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:45,491
you know,
you might be able to do that in some 

588
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:46,931
small way,
but the probability that you could or 

589
00:33:46,931 --> 00:33:48,890
should try to do that on large scale is.
It's pretty low.

590
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:54,910
So.
So in the mythological representation 

591
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,371
section,
I'm going to talk to you about the 

592
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,071
fundamental elements of narrative.
And the reason that I think that that's 

593
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:05,480
necessary is because there's,
there's sort of two things that you have

594
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:07,490
to consider when you're talking about 
people.

595
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,760
And one is objectively,
what is a person like?

596
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:17,980
They'll say what you might think about 
what a rat is like or maybe even what a 

597
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:17,980
rock is like.

598
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,690
So that's a,
that's a scientific question in some 

599
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,391
sense,
but then there's another question which 

600
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:25,400
is,
or maybe two questions.

601
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,760
How do people act and how should they 
act?

602
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,060
And maybe the first one is a scientific 
question,

603
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:37,061
but the second one certainly isn't.
And the way that we explore how people 

604
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:41,360
do act and how they should act has a lot
more to do with narrative then it has to

605
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:43,880
do with science and you know,
you know this,

606
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,460
all you have to do is think about it.
You know,

607
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,500
when you think about where do you get 
most of your information about what 

608
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,250
people are like when you're not actually
just interacting with some people.

609
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,620
And the answer to that is quite 
straightforward.

610
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,900
You read novels,
he read literature,

611
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,200
you go see movies,
you watch a game of thrones,

612
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:02,000
you've been John,
game of thrones,

613
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:04,010
you know,
you go watch star wars.

614
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,440
You know,
maybe you line up for three days if 

615
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,440
you're completely insane to go see star 
wars.

616
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,310
You know,
and you might ask,

617
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:11,810
well,
what in the world are you doing?

618
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,650
Well,
people are hungry for information about 

619
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,411
how people do act and how they should 
act and we're absolutely compelled by 

620
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:25,010
narratives and there's a reason for 
that.

621
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,720
Well,
and you kind of know what a narrative is

622
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:31,721
and one isn't right.
Go to a movie and you think are the 

623
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:32,370
character development is pretty good.
But um,

624
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,970
you know,
as a story it was terrible.

625
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,770
And then maybe you talk with your 
friends about why it a terrible story.

626
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:40,350
But the funny thing is you kind of know,
right?

627
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:43,110
It's like some things are stories and 
some things aren't.

628
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,290
And laying out what actually makes 
something,

629
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:51,291
a story that's very difficult,
but you still know it and you can come 

630
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:52,990
to some consensus even,
you know,

631
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,070
if you look on I am deb or rotten 
tomatoes,

632
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:01,370
you know,
people form large group consensus about 

633
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,960
what constitutes an acceptable narrative
pretty damn quickly and there seems to 

634
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,540
be at least a certain amount of 
agreement,

635
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,910
you know,
barring individual differences.

636
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,450
So the mythological and the demonic 
discussions that were going to undertake

637
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,960
have a couple of purposes.
One is to provide you with the 

638
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,050
foundations of a language that you can 
use to understand narrative,

639
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:33,270
and that's going to prove very,
very useful because most of the clinical

640
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,510
theories that we're going to talk about 
are really narrative based and once you 

641
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,700
understand their mythological 
substructure,

642
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,710
so to speak,
it gives you a framework within which 

643
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:45,810
you can slot the theories,
you know,

644
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:50,811
because one of the things that's 
complicated about personality theory is 

645
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:52,470
that there are a lot of personality 
theories and you might think,

646
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:53,970
well,
how the hell can that be?

647
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:58,870
Because if it's a theory,
theoretically there can only be one.

648
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,930
There's only one theory of relativity 
route.

649
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,360
Roughly speaking,
it's a little fuzzy around the edges,

650
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:06,960
but people agree on the core elements.
Well with personality theory,

651
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,030
there's,
there is many,

652
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:13,350
many different personality theories and 
so then you might think,

653
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:18,351
well,
how are you supposed to make any sense 

654
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:18,351
out of that?

655
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:18,351
Well,
there's two ways.

656
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:21,951
One is to put all of them into a more 
fundamental underlying structure and 

657
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:27,021
that's something that I'm really going 
to strive to have you guys do while 

658
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:29,901
you're taking this course and the other 
is to actually adopt a slightly 

659
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:33,651
different set of presuppositions about 
personality theories and so you could 

660
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:33,651
say,
well,

661
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,110
there's only one theory of relativity,
but then you might say,

662
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:39,000
well yeah,
there's only one theory of relativity,

663
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:44,001
but then consider a tool box,
so maybe some of you are relatively 

664
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:49,311
handy and you have a tool box.
What's in the toolbox hammers or a 

665
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:52,020
hammer saws,
wrenches,

666
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,730
pliers,
vice grips,

667
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,310
etc.
You know when you might say,

668
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,380
well,
their tools,

669
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,560
why do you need all those tools?
And the answer is,

670
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:06,630
well,
you can hammer a nail in with a ranch,

671
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,840
but it'd be a lot better if you could 
use a hammer and you can probably bang a

672
00:38:09,841 --> 00:38:14,841
bolt off with a hammer,
but it would be a lot better if you had 

673
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:14,841
a ranch and so then you might think,
well,

674
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:18,390
if you're trying to do something 
complicated and sophisticated,

675
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,610
why not have a bunch of tools?

676
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,660
Now?
We don't generally think of scientific 

677
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,020
theories as tools,
although that is what they are above all

678
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:33,021
else,
their tools and then when we're dealing 

679
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:33,021
with something as complicated as a human
being,

680
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:36,700
while you know we may need more than one
tool to get to the bottom of it and it's

681
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:41,701
also the case,
you know that to say understand that 

682
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:41,701
human being.
Well,

683
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:43,630
that's a complicated thing.
It's guess You might say,

684
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:44,470
well,
I understand.

685
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,600
To what end you don't mean comprehensive
universal on esc and understanding.

686
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:54,760
Obviously you mean I want to know x 
about someone because I have some desire

687
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,880
in relationship to my interactions with 
and so there's all sorts of tools that 

688
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,381
can facilitate that.
So what I would say is that no freud's a

689
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:08,530
microscope and young as a telescope,
that's one way of thinking about it.

690
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:13,531
I mean,
there's no particular reason I 

691
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:13,540
associated either of those with those 
two tools,

692
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:18,541
but the point is is that if you paid 
careful attention to personality 

693
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:22,411
theories,
they can expand your capacity to 

694
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:25,951
represent yourself in ways that's 
extremely useful because you should 

695
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:29,611
understand who you are and why and what 
implications that has for you because 

696
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,040
you're a transformable creature,
but you also have a fairly stable 

697
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,040
underlying sub structure,
right?

698
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,880
Otherwise you just melt like an octopus,
so you're this weird dynamic combination

699
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:47,140
of relatively permanent structure and 
then embedded capacity to transform.

700
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:52,290
you have a nature and so understanding 
your nature is extraordinarily youth 

701
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:57,530
worthwhile and so hopefully what we're 
going to do during this course is give 

702
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,921
you a whole bunch of tools to understand
yourself and other people with tools 

703
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:05,961
that will really be useful.
Things you can use day to day to 

704
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:09,381
understand yourselves and your families 
and so on and to improve your future 

705
00:40:09,381 --> 00:40:11,550
with any luck.
And then also cover

706
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:18,980
the elements of you that are stable.
Most of which I would say have been 

707
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,011
discovered,
at least in the more objective sense by 

708
00:40:22,011 --> 00:40:25,581
biological psychologists.
So mostly animal researches peculiarly 

709
00:40:25,581 --> 00:40:26,100
enough.
Okay,

710
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:31,101
so mythological representations.
We're going to take a trip back through 

711
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:35,181
time.
We're going to look at our kick and 

712
00:40:35,181 --> 00:40:38,180
ancient stories of mankind told by 
members of our species to each other,

713
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,540
and I'm going to concentrate on stories 
that have lasted.

714
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:47,810
We don't know how long we have stories 
that in the written form or 4,000

715
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:51,000
years old,
but all the evidence suggests that those

716
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:54,690
stories are based on traditions that go 
back far,

717
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:58,320
far beyond that,
at least 50,000

718
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:03,321
years and maybe way before that.
So we'll take a look at those and now 

719
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:05,800
it'll give us a foundation that we can 
use to build on.

720
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,820
And then we're going to look at shamonic
rituals and descriptions to get some 

721
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,380
sense of the archetype of 
transformation,

722
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,940
which sort of means,
well,

723
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,120
what is it that you have to undergo when
you're changing and what are you likely 

724
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,400
to experience when that happens?
Now I cAn give you a bit of a preview.

725
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:31,870
It's not always the case.
Maybe it's seldom the case that if you 

726
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:35,450
learned something important that it's,
you know,

727
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,090
this happens to people all the time,
so maybe I don't know.

728
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:42,350
Maybe you had a recent relationship that
went seriously sour and you know,

729
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:45,380
maybe it was because you were going out 
with a jerk or maybe it's because you're

730
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:50,381
just not very sophisticated and no doubt
you're trying to figure out which of 

731
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:51,350
those happens to be true.
Well you're,

732
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,120
you know,
considering the relationship,

733
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:58,930
but generally what happens to people 
when they're moving towards something 

734
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,711
and the bottom falls out because 
something occurs that they didn't 

735
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:05,300
understand and couldn't predict.
Maybe in their own behavior.

736
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:10,301
Maybe you had an affair while you were 
in your relationship and you didn't 

737
00:42:10,301 --> 00:42:13,841
expect that.
while what happens is that your current 

738
00:42:13,841 --> 00:42:17,290
model of yourself and perhaps even if 
the world is demonstrated as 

739
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,770
insufficient,
not rattles,

740
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:23,771
you are badly and then you're rattled up
for some good length of time.

741
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,240
Not very motivated,
somewhat depressed,

742
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,580
fairly anxious.
You sort of fell apart.

743
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,660
You don't know which way is up and then 
maybe if you're lucky you think about it

744
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:36,440
and talk about it and put yourself back 
together and when you come out the other

745
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:41,441
side,
you're a little smarter and a little 

746
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:41,441
more together than you were to begin 
with.

747
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:41,480
Now,
if you're unlucky,

748
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:46,481
you just stay in the little pit for 
people can stay in the little pit for a 

749
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:51,191
very,
very long time and that's not so good 

750
00:42:51,191 --> 00:42:54,281
and so you know the process of 
transformation is actually quite 

751
00:42:54,281 --> 00:42:57,251
dangerous because it doesn't necessarily
have to be completed in a successful 

752
00:42:57,251 --> 00:42:59,880
manner,
but it does have a pattern.

753
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:04,930
The pattern usually is you think you 
know what you're doing and then 

754
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:09,191
something happens to demonstrate that 
you actually don't know what you're 

755
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:12,161
doing and that puts you in a spin and 
then through careful analysis and 

756
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:17,441
support and discussion and other 
processes that we don't really 

757
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:17,441
understand very well.

758
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,500
You come to incorporate the anomalous 
knowledge,

759
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,660
knocked you on your back.
You reconstruct your personality and 

760
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:30,731
your representations of the world and 
then you move ahead hopefully more than 

761
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:36,110
you were before.
But it's an interesting thing to know,

762
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:41,111
you know,
one of the things nature said again was 

763
00:43:41,111 --> 00:43:43,421
that you could,
you could tell the character of a human 

764
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:43,610
being by how much truth there willing to
tolerate.

765
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:49,180
Now that's an interesting phrase because
you generally think of people because 

766
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,501
they're optimistic.
They generally think of truth as 

767
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:53,501
something positive.
Obviously it's better to know the truth.

768
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:57,260
It's like no if you pulled the wool over
your eyes as a general rule,

769
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:59,810
learning the truth is not a pleasant 
experience.

770
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,320
That doesn't necessarily mean that it's 
not something you should do,

771
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,700
but the idea that the path to 
enlightenment is blissful.

772
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,720
A,
that's not a very smart idea.

773
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,730
In fact,
it's quite the opposite.

774
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,660
So the shamanic rituals basically 
manifest that's in an architectural way.

775
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:23,230
So one of the things you see happening 
with the typicals,

776
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,470
the sharman,
by the way,

777
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:29,471
shamanism is a worldwide phenomenon.
It seems to be associated with a 

778
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:32,820
primordial or archaic psychology of 
transformation.

779
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:37,821
It's often drug aided and generally what
happens is that a shamonic 

780
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:43,341
transformation is accompanied by a 
descent into something approximating 

781
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,920
psychological death and then a 
rebuilding and a rebirth that puts the 

782
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,151
person out on the other side.
It's like an initiation ritual and 

783
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:56,960
that's another way of thinking about it 
or you might think about it as the 

784
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,740
depression that possessed you during 
your first semester of university,

785
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,850
which either

786
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:05,430
knock you out of the university 
altogether because that happens to a lot

787
00:45:05,431 --> 00:45:09,150
of people are which you recovered from 
and finally became a university student.

788
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:12,000
Although perhaps that wasn't a 
particularly pleasant transition.

789
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,480
You know,
we've done some testing with u of t 

790
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,851
students and it's interesting to note 
that about a third of you meet criteria 

791
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,270
for clinical depression your first year 
here.

792
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,960
Now,
what that indicates to me is that the 

793
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:26,960
criteria for clinical depression,
our little on the sensitive side,

794
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:29,130
but,
but regardless,

795
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:31,260
because if a third of people meet the 
criteria,

796
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,060
thank yeah,
well that's a little sensitive,

797
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,040
but by the same token,
you know,

798
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:40,640
it's not an easy adjustment and the old 
you has to die and generally that's not 

799
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:46,251
very pleasant,
so and it's a good way to think about 

800
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:50,361
the impediments to learning because you 
hardly ever learned something without 

801
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:53,601
having part of you dies first and that's
part of the reason that people are 

802
00:45:53,601 --> 00:45:54,660
rather resistant to learning anything 
new.

803
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:56,400
That's important.
Okay,

804
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,570
well,
so you've got that.

805
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,600
Now after that we're going to talk about
piaget and piaget isn't necessarily 

806
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,101
known as a personality psychologist,
but that's okay.

807
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:11,620
Psj published a developmental 
psychologist,

808
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:13,510
maybe the greatest developmental 
psychologists.

809
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,270
he published a very large number of 
books,

810
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:20,450
many of which haven't even been 
translated yet,

811
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,330
some of which haven't even been 
published yet.

812
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:26,850
So piaget thought a lot of things about 
a lot of things and he's generally known

813
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:31,851
for his stage theory of development,
but he really wasn't all that into that 

814
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:35,361
stage theory.
It just seemed to be the part of this 

815
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:37,941
theory that I would say rather dimwitted
western intellectuals could grasp onto 

816
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:41,040
most easily and so that's generally what
you hear about,

817
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,520
but piaget was a very,
very sophisticated thinker and one of 

818
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,690
the things he was interested in was,
well,

819
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,380
he was interested in how the child,
in some sense boots itself up.

820
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:57,590
That's a reasonable way of thinking 
about it because you know when you turn 

821
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,931
on a computer,
what happens is a certain number of 

822
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:02,811
primitive functions,
primitive fundamental functions come 

823
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:06,261
online first and then those functions 
enable more complex functions to emerge 

824
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:11,571
and then those functions may enable more
complex functions to emerge and soon 

825
00:47:11,571 --> 00:47:15,210
there your computer is waiting for you 
and human beings are kind of like that.

826
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,590
So when we're first born were very 
primitive.

827
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:22,770
When we're first born were very 
immature.

828
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:23,940
That's a better way of thinking about 
it.

829
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:28,941
We're not precisely primitive.
We still have very large brains and 

830
00:47:28,941 --> 00:47:29,160
there are more connections in those 
brains.

831
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,870
Birth and there were any that there will
be for the rest of your life,

832
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,320
which is quite interesting.
You actually dye into your personality 

833
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,060
because what happens isn't so much that 
you make new connections instead a whole

834
00:47:40,061 --> 00:47:42,820
bunch of the ones you already have that 
you don't use disappeared,

835
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,500
so that's pretty peculiar anyways.
When you first born,

836
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:52,060
there's not a lot to you in terms of 
capacity to engage with the world.

837
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,060
Your mouth is pretty wired up.
Your lips and your tongue,

838
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,120
which is a good thing because you have 
to breastfeed and that's actually not 

839
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,331
very simple.
You have to have a clue to do that and 

840
00:48:03,331 --> 00:48:04,900
it's the first complex social 
interaction you're likely to engage in.

841
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:10,110
So you.
You're born with a fair bit of a 

842
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,740
priority.
Sophisticated wiring already in place,

843
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,660
but the rest of you,
man,

844
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,840
it's not there much at all.
You can't control your arms.

845
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,670
You know,
if you watch a baby in a crib,

846
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,150
a young baby and it's not swaddled up,
you know,

847
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:26,220
their arms sort of float around in space
and so to their legs and now and then 

848
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,761
they might get themselves and generally 
that seems to come as quite a shock to 

849
00:48:29,761 --> 00:48:29,761
the baby.
It's not.

850
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:35,310
It's peripheral nervous system.
The peripheral elements of its central 

851
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:38,290
nervous system are not well developed at
birth,

852
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,310
and so it's almost as if the baby has to
discover its limbs.

853
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,770
It sort of expands from the middle 
outwards,

854
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:49,771
it has to discover its limbs and then 
start to figure out what to do with 

855
00:48:49,771 --> 00:48:54,511
them,
and so what piaget attempted to do was 

856
00:48:54,511 --> 00:48:57,601
to lay out the processes by which a 
child unfolded into the world.

857
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:03,750
Now,
some there's a biological basis to that 

858
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,971
because you come into the world at birth
with a set of reflexes at hand,

859
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,120
and those reflexes are enough to get you
started.

860
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:16,140
And so piaget,
here's one way of trying to understand 

861
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,900
piaget.
I like it quite a bit.

862
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,120
It's a bit of an over simplification,
but it'll do.

863
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:25,140
There's lots of different ways of 
thinking about what the world is made 

864
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:25,330
up.
Now you know if you're a classically,

865
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,480
if you're a classical scientists,
you tend to think that the world is made

866
00:49:28,481 --> 00:49:32,080
out of matter.
Matter is made out of atoms,

867
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:35,320
and then atoms are made out of god only 
knows what atoms are made out of,

868
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:37,420
right?
Because by the time you get uNder adams,

869
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,180
you just have no idea what's going on 
down there,

870
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:45,181
but you know,
we generally don't think about that too 

871
00:49:45,181 --> 00:49:48,031
much and we sort of assume newtonian 
reality and that everything is made out 

872
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,320
of hard little particles like dust and 
that's the scientific one.

873
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,920
But there's other ways of looking at the
world that are not only equally valid 

874
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:59,410
but equally necessary and equally 
powerful.

875
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:04,411
And one of them is that you could look 
at the world as a matrix of information 

876
00:50:04,411 --> 00:50:09,170
you know,
and so inflammation generally has 

877
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,821
significance and meaning or at least in 
so far as the information is 

878
00:50:11,821 --> 00:50:13,450
conceptualized by human beings.
And so for example,

879
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:17,020
if you're two years old and you're 
crawling around on the floor and the dog

880
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:19,420
has a bone and you grab it and the dog 
nips you,

881
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,600
that's informative.
And so what piaget claims is that 

882
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:31,410
children come into the world with an 
information seeking structure and that 

883
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:36,700
as they interact with the world,
phenomena emerge that they can model 

884
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:39,920
with their bodies.
So for example,

885
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:46,390
if I'm going to drink this,
then I'd have to model it with my hand 

886
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,470
before I can do so and so it turns out,
for example,

887
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:48,830
that wouldn't.

888
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:54,070
If this thing sitting here,
especially if I'm thirsty and I look at 

889
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:58,391
it,
my eyes tell them my hands to get ready 

890
00:50:58,391 --> 00:51:01,481
to grab it.
And so when you say you understand 

891
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:04,331
something,
what you mean is that at least part of 

892
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:06,500
what you mean is that when you perceive 
it,

893
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:11,210
it maps itself onto your body.
And so this happens at pretty low levels

894
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:12,950
of your nervous system.
So for example,

895
00:51:12,951 --> 00:51:16,460
there are people who are blind.
They say they're blind,

896
00:51:16,461 --> 00:51:21,461
they can't see anything.
But if you move your hands up like this 

897
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:24,350
and you ask them to guess which hand 
you're lifting,

898
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,960
they can do it with almost 100 percent 
accuracy.

899
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,130
And you think,
well,

900
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:30,560
how the hell can that possibly be?
They Were blind.

901
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:36,610
Well,
the reason that happens is because your 

902
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:36,920
eyes are detecting patterns in the 
world.

903
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,960
Some of those patterns you perceive as 
conscious reality,

904
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,500
but other patterns you just mapped right
onto your spine or or onto your 

905
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:47,540
emotional system doesn't.

906
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:52,570
You don't need the perception of the 
object in order to have that activated 

907
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:53,390
because you know you probably fade.
There's the world,

908
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:54,530
you see it,
you think about it,

909
00:51:54,531 --> 00:51:55,980
you evaluate it,
and then you act.

910
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:00,080
It's like that isn't how it works.
It's very seldomly how it works.

911
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:03,260
Partly because it's just too damn slow.
You know?

912
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:08,261
If you had to think about everything,
you'd be running over pedestrians 

913
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:08,261
nonstop,
right?

914
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:12,460
You have to be able to react very,
very quickly and part of the way you do 

915
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,671
that is by having your sensory systems 
map right onto your motor output 

916
00:52:15,671 --> 00:52:16,850
systems.
So,

917
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:23,090
so piaget,
well,

918
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:30,930
for piaget,
part of the way that the personality 

919
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,451
emerges out of the doldrums of infancy 
is that the child encounters the world 

920
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:38,790
and incorporates the information that 
they gather as a consequence of bumping 

921
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:43,681
up against it and then they build 
themselves in some sense from their 

922
00:52:43,681 --> 00:52:47,851
bodies and the ability,
the abilities that they're practicing 

923
00:52:47,851 --> 00:52:48,160
with their bodies,
like the gripping mechanism.

924
00:52:48,161 --> 00:52:53,161
And the pointing mechanism and the 
scratching mechanism and all those 

925
00:52:53,161 --> 00:52:55,981
things that they can build,
they build those up to the point where 

926
00:52:55,981 --> 00:52:59,520
they can start to use abstractions and 
so the baby sort of spirals out of 

927
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,040
nowhere using it's exploratory capacity,
absorbing information from the world and

928
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:06,080
creates its personality that way.
So lovely marlin.

929
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:10,420
We'll cover that in some detail.
The depths psychologists,

930
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,880
I concentrate primarily on young and 
freud and you know,

931
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,400
if you take a personality course,
generally you'll,

932
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,640
you'll be introduced to freud first and 
then you'll be introduced to yoga and 

933
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,581
maybe I'd learned some of the neil 
friday ends more or less as 

934
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:29,521
afterthoughts to freud,
but I don't really think that's 

935
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:29,521
appropriate.

936
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,880
First of all,
I think you can make a strong case that 

937
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,651
you was that the utility of [inaudible] 
theory is particularly evident when 

938
00:53:43,861 --> 00:53:47,370
you're talking about radical 
similarities between people.

939
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,650
So young was very biologically oriented 
in some ways.

940
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:57,740
he was way ahead of biological 
psychiatrists and psychologists because 

941
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,790
when young was beginning to formulate 
his theories in the west,

942
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:02,990
in,
in,

943
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,370
in,
in north America anyways,

944
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,480
in the United States,
most of the people who were studying 

945
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,611
human beings were behaviorists and 
behaviors basically presumed that you 

946
00:54:13,611 --> 00:54:16,761
are a blank slate at birth and that you 
learned how to do everything that you 

947
00:54:16,761 --> 00:54:18,330
know how to do.
Well,

948
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,520
that's not true at all.
Um,

949
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:26,100
first of all,
you can't learn everything that you know

950
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:31,101
how to do because you have to know 
something to start the whole process 

951
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:31,101
off.
And second,

952
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:35,031
you know,
you don't have to learn really to 

953
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:35,220
understand what a dog's grown means.

954
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:40,670
You know,
it's kind of wired into you and you 

955
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:40,670
already don't have to learn to be afraid
of the dark man.

956
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,600
You've got that down by the time you 
were about three,

957
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,970
you know.
so there's lots of things that are built

958
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:47,280
right into people and what exactly that 
means,

959
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:48,660
we're not sure about.
I mean it does.

960
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:49,470
Look,
for example,

961
00:54:49,471 --> 00:54:52,050
like snake phobia is,
is innate.

962
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,080
And even if the actual phobia isn't an 
eight,

963
00:54:55,081 --> 00:55:00,081
and it probably is,
you can learn to be phobic of snakes in 

964
00:55:00,081 --> 00:55:02,961
no time flat.
whereas like trying to become phobic of 

965
00:55:02,961 --> 00:55:02,961
pistols is very,
very difficult.

966
00:55:02,961 --> 00:55:05,490
Now,
young was very interested in the,

967
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,140
I think what the best way to think about
it is the substrata of human cognition.

968
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:15,730
You know,
because human beings are a particular 

969
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:15,730
type of thing.
It's not like our,

970
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,640
our souls are disconnected from our 
bodies and that our knowledge is somehow

971
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:27,830
appropriate or universal in some way 
that would make sense if we didn't have 

972
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:28,560
bodies.

973
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,790
We're not down at all.
We're in our bodies.

974
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,940
Our brains are adapted to our bodies.
Our minds are adapted to our bodies and 

975
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:41,841
so as our knowledge.
And that means that our cognitive 

976
00:55:41,841 --> 00:55:45,570
abilities are theories of the world,
have biological substructures,

977
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,870
and those are preset positions in some 
sense for our knowledge that we don't 

978
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,380
have to learn.
So for example,

979
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,570
you don't really have to learn that 
being punched hers.

980
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,800
You just discover that you don't really 
have to learn what a smile means.

981
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,900
You don't really have to learn what 
anger means.

982
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:04,230
You'll experience it so it's right in 
you.

983
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:06,300
It's you like little kids,
little babies.

984
00:56:06,301 --> 00:56:08,550
When they're crying,
they're often angry.

985
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,620
So for example,
by nine months of age,

986
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:14,640
a baby can more or less identified its 
mother.

987
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:20,750
So someone walks into the baby's room 
and takes a look at the baby and it's 

988
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,680
not the baby's mother and the baby 
starts crying and you think,

989
00:56:22,681 --> 00:56:23,500
oh baby.

990
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,430
It's like,
fair enough.

991
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:29,490
That baby is not sad.
That baby is angry and you can tell if 

992
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,240
you look at the baby because it's 
turning all red.

993
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,850
And that's what people do when they cry,
when they're angry.

994
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,120
And so it's a good thing to know when 
you're arguing with someone and they get

995
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:38,830
upset,
maybe they start to cry.

996
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,120
You think,
whoa,

997
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:42,160
the poor person,
but then if you look,

998
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,310
you'll see that they're all red and that
means they'd like to strangle you,

999
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,390
but they're,
you know,

1000
00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:49,120
they're social niceties is hopefully 
preventing them.

1001
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:54,510
So that can certainly change your 
attitude towards whether or not you 

1002
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:54,610
should be feeling sorry for them when 
you hurt their feelings.

1003
00:56:55,030 --> 00:57:00,030
So,
so there's all sorts of things that are 

1004
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,210
universal about human beings and what 
yoga was very,

1005
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:06,211
very interested in what those universals
are and how they played out in patterns 

1006
00:57:06,211 --> 00:57:06,211
of behavior.

1007
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:12,270
So you can imagine,
you can imagine that you have an 

1008
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,851
instinct say like anger and thinking 
about that way.

1009
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,170
He's like a cross section that person's 
angry,

1010
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:22,500
you know,
and you can imagine a facial 

1011
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:22,500
configuration that would go along with 
that,

1012
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,710
but in a more sophisticated way if you 
want it to represent anger,

1013
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:27,940
maybe you've represented like a drama,
like a story you know began.

1014
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:30,160
that's actually what you want to know.
If someone gets angry,

1015
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,580
what happened?
Well,

1016
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:39,340
imagine that you took a thousand stories
about angry people and you blow them all

1017
00:57:39,341 --> 00:57:44,341
into one story so that everything that 
was common about all the stories about 

1018
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:46,660
anger were encapsulated in a single 
story.

1019
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,610
Well that would be the archetypal story 
of anger and everyone would recognize it

1020
00:57:51,611 --> 00:57:56,611
because it's like anger represented like
a movie in some sense in its purest 

1021
00:57:56,611 --> 00:57:56,720
form.
Well,

1022
00:57:56,721 --> 00:58:01,721
that's an archetype and that's the sort 
of thing that was extraordinarily 

1023
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:02,260
interested in understanding a document.

1024
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:07,650
And it's a tremendous amount of fun.
So one of the things we'll do is I'm 

1025
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,230
going to show you some movies,
probably the lion king,

1026
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:13,231
at least parts of it,
and I'm going to show you how the 

1027
00:58:13,231 --> 00:58:14,650
archetypal structure manifests itself 
and that's really worth knowing.

1028
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,620
It's kind of a pain because then from 
now on you go to movies and you think,

1029
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:22,621
oh well no,
that's that archetipal structured and 

1030
00:58:22,621 --> 00:58:23,410
that's what that symbol means and you'll
really be annoying to your friends.

1031
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:27,280
But it's very entertaining and it's very
illuminating.

1032
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:32,400
And partly because what's really cool 
about these archetypal story structures 

1033
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,360
is that not only they do,
they tell you who you are,

1034
00:58:34,361 --> 00:58:36,760
but they tell you in some sense who you 
should be.

1035
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,060
Now that's cool because one of the 
things that modern people have a real 

1036
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,110
problem with is trying to understand 
whether or not life has any meaning.

1037
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,480
You know,
we look at the world from a scientific 

1038
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:49,480
perspective and we say,
well,

1039
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:49,930
it appears that all of this is,
you know,

1040
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:55,230
without meaning,
it doesn't mean anything in any cosmic 

1041
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:55,230
sense.
It's,

1042
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:58,530
it's a pretty dopey conclusion as far as
I'm concerned because the originators of

1043
00:58:59,111 --> 00:59:04,111
the scientific method excluded 
subjective meaning from the doctrine at 

1044
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,360
the outset.
So you know,

1045
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,350
if you look at the world scientifically 
and you saying,

1046
00:59:08,351 --> 00:59:09,880
well,
it's without subjective meaning.

1047
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:10,330
It's like,
well,

1048
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:15,331
yeah,
obviously because science was set up so 

1049
00:59:15,331 --> 00:59:16,630
that all the subjective meaning would be
stripped away from the phenomena.

1050
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:21,930
So you knoW,
it's not something to be really shocked 

1051
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:21,930
about afterwards.
And it also doesn't mean that there's no

1052
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:26,651
such thing as subjective.
Meaning it just means that it's very 

1053
00:59:26,651 --> 00:59:28,040
difficult to get a grip on it from a 
purely scientific perspective.

1054
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,280
And one of the lovely things about 
architectural stories is they tell you 

1055
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,600
in a way that's universally believable 
who you are and,

1056
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:43,810
and that's very cool and you know,
because you think you can learn this in 

1057
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:44,300
university too,
and it just tears me up.

1058
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:49,300
You know,
you learn implicitly or explicitly and 

1059
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,990
almost all of the fields of study that 
you're going to undertake,

1060
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:55,991
especially on the humanities and that 
moral morality is relative and that 

1061
00:59:55,991 --> 01:00:00,491
there's no ultimate meaning,
which is a really rotten thing to be 

1062
01:00:00,491 --> 01:00:03,971
teaching people of your age.
You don't because you're too damn young 

1063
01:00:03,971 --> 01:00:08,111
to be nIhilistic.
You know you can meet our listing when 

1064
01:00:08,111 --> 01:00:08,111
you're 85,
you're,

1065
01:00:08,111 --> 01:00:09,770
you're all done by then,
but to be nihilistic now that's a bloody

1066
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:11,370
catastrophe.
You know,

1067
01:00:11,371 --> 01:00:16,100
when it's completely pointless because 
the notion of the notion that things are

1068
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:20,090
meaningless in some ultimate sense.
It's a,

1069
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:25,510
it's an extraordinarily primitive 
philosophical theory and it does not 

1070
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:28,400
serve people well.
It makes them sick.

1071
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:33,940
And so one of the things that you might 
consider that is that if you're stupid 

1072
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,510
theory makes you sick,
maybe there's something wrong with it.

1073
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:40,750
It might be a criteria for the utility 
or perhaps even the truth of the theory,

1074
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:47,050
you know,
depends how you think about these 

1075
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:47,050
things.

1076
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:47,050
You know,
you might say,

1077
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:48,530
well,
If a truth makes you sick,

1078
01:00:48,531 --> 01:00:50,240
that doesn't mean it's any less than the
truth.

1079
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:50,990
Well,
maybe,

1080
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,480
maybe it really does mean that it's 
much,

1081
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:58,510
much less of a truth.
It depends to some degree on what you 

1082
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:59,330
mean by truth.
So anyways,

1083
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,320
[inaudible] very,
very,

1084
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:02,150
very,
very useful for that.

1085
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:07,300
He's at terrifying thinker really.
Like I read when I was about 23 or 24,

1086
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,810
I spent two years in.
I read preTty much everything.

1087
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:16,550
You wrote about 23 volumes and it just 
blew me into bits.

1088
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:19,670
I had no idea what the hell was going on
in my dreams changed.

1089
01:01:19,671 --> 01:01:22,370
And really it was really,
really rough.

1090
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:25,300
I was reading nietzsche at the same time
and he's just about as bad,

1091
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:28,520
like nature setting philosophize with a 
hammer,

1092
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:33,900
you know,
and that's great unless he's taking a 

1093
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:33,900
hammer to your skull and that's not 
nearly so pleasant.

1094
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,700
So you know,
young,

1095
01:01:34,701 --> 01:01:39,701
he's,
he's a completely different sort of 

1096
01:01:39,701 --> 01:01:41,891
creature and I think that's part of the 
reason you never really learned about 

1097
01:01:41,891 --> 01:01:41,891
them in the university.
You know,

1098
01:01:41,891 --> 01:01:46,480
if you don't understand,
to me it looks weird and if you do 

1099
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,641
understand them a little bit,
he's terrifying and you're bloody well 

1100
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:48,641
going to stop.
You'll think,

1101
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:49,100
oh no,
that's okay.

1102
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:54,240
I don't really need to know that.
So freud,

1103
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,190
freud tonight,
nice whipping boy for psychologists,

1104
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:02,100
which I also think is pretty pathetic 
because it's in great,

1105
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:03,620
ungrateful to begin with.
You know,

1106
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:07,160
freud was really the person who 
formalize the idea of done unconscious,

1107
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,830
you know,
now everyone takes that for granted that

1108
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:14,831
there's the cognitive unconscious.
That's what the psychologist discovered 

1109
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:15,890
in what the 19 eighties.
There's a cognitive unconscious.

1110
01:02:15,891 --> 01:02:16,640
It's like,
yeah,

1111
01:02:16,641 --> 01:02:19,650
good work guys.
They'd figured that out back in 1910,

1112
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,130
you know,
but you don't see the credit being given

1113
01:02:23,131 --> 01:02:25,020
to freud for making that sort of 
discovery.

1114
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,330
If you look at experimental psychology,
which I think,

1115
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:32,390
like I said,
I think that's really ungrateful for 

1116
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:35,730
it's a strange guy and you know,
you can take issue with especially the 

1117
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:37,300
details of his theory,
you know,

1118
01:02:37,301 --> 01:02:40,260
like the eatable complex for example,
or penis envy,

1119
01:02:40,261 --> 01:02:41,490
those sorts of things.
It's like,

1120
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:47,710
nO,
in some ways they seem laughably 

1121
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:48,360
anachronistic,
but you know,

1122
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:54,740
sometimes someone can be wrong in the 
details and right in the overall 

1123
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:56,460
conception because theories are 
multilayered things,

1124
01:02:56,461 --> 01:02:58,650
right?
So sometimes I read a student essay,

1125
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:01,890
you know,
and the sentences are just awful.

1126
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,920
This person like our god only knows 
where they learned to write probably in 

1127
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,350
a high school somewhere and you know 
It's incomprehensible.

1128
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,300
But if you read the whole thing and you 
think,

1129
01:03:12,301 --> 01:03:13,740
man,
there's an idea in here,

1130
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,960
you know,
the person is smarter than their ability

1131
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:18,270
to write and so then you can write,
you can say,

1132
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,800
look,
you can't write worth a damn,

1133
01:03:19,801 --> 01:03:24,801
but you know,
you're pretty smart and you've got some 

1134
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,591
ideas here that if you could articulate,
might be a really high quality so you 

1135
01:03:27,591 --> 01:03:29,430
can be wrong in the details and right in
the overall picture.

1136
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:34,430
And freud was like that all the time.
And freud was also unbeatable in 

1137
01:03:37,721 --> 01:03:42,721
relationship to familial pathology.
So from [inaudible] perspective,

1138
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:53,210
the fundamental task of the emerging 
human being was to extricate themselves 

1139
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:55,590
from their family.
Now you might think,

1140
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:57,360
well why is that such a problem?
Well,

1141
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,470
here's a couple of reasons.
First,

1142
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:05,490
your parents take care of you.
So it was like maybe you don't want to 

1143
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:05,760
dispense with that too early,
especially if they really,

1144
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:10,761
really take care of you and that's the 
whole situation from the freudian 

1145
01:04:10,761 --> 01:04:15,060
perspective,
it's like the atypical situation arises 

1146
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,141
when you have a parent or two parents 
who do so much for you that you're no 

1147
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:23,100
longer able to do anything for yourself 
and that is not a good situation.

1148
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,280
It's extraordinarily pathological and 
there is nobody like freud who lays out 

1149
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:32,250
the detaIls of that pathology and we're 
gonna watch a movie from it's called,

1150
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:36,000
which is very disturbing movie,
which I suppose is a trigger warning for

1151
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,860
those of you who think you need trigger 
warnings.

1152
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,360
Um,
it's a very,

1153
01:04:39,361 --> 01:04:44,361
very distressing documentary,
but it will show you freddy and 

1154
01:04:44,361 --> 01:04:47,511
psychopathology that like,
you've never seen it unless you happen 

1155
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:48,560
to live in a thoroughly eat whole 
family.

1156
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,070
All right,
so look,

1157
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:55,700
I didn't get through the whole outline.
I'll tell you very briefly what you're 

1158
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,950
going to be required to do and then 
we'll continue this in the next lecture.

1159
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,000
So just three exams,
two midterms and a final.

1160
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:05,280
There are multiple choice.
Okay.

1161
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:10,281
I'll post some of the questions before 
the exam so that you know what you're 

1162
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:13,341
getting into.
I don't think they're particularly 

1163
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:13,341
difficult.
Some of you will beg to differ.

1164
01:05:13,341 --> 01:05:18,280
Um,
there's pressure on us this year to 

1165
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:18,280
curve the grade,
so beware.

1166
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:18,430
I may have to do that.
Okay.

1167
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:19,780
Just in,
you need to know that,

1168
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,880
um,
you have to write an essay,

1169
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:25,030
750 words.
that's not a very long essay,

1170
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:26,710
but that makes it actually more 
difficult.

1171
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:31,860
The signup for the topics for the essay 
or on the website or you can just go 

1172
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:37,111
there and sign up.
There's 20 different topics and there's 

1173
01:05:37,111 --> 01:05:40,351
15 slots for each topic.
So I would recommend that you do that 

1174
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,351
quite quickly.
You have to do a personality self 

1175
01:05:43,351 --> 01:05:44,440
analysis,
seven point five percent of your grade.

1176
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:48,430
The link to that is online too.
You can get started on that whenever you

1177
01:05:48,431 --> 01:05:49,750
want.
Um,

1178
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,290
your ta.
One of them,

1179
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:58,420
that's christine brophy.
She's over there in the corner of 

1180
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,320
patiently waiting for me to introduce 
her.

1181
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:03,250
she has office hours.
they're posted online.

1182
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:05,530
You can sign up for her office hours 
online.

1183
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:08,380
You can also sign up for my office hours
online,

1184
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:10,070
so.
Well,

1185
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:13,600
that's halfway through what the course 
is going to be about.

1186
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,520
So we'll see you on thursday.
