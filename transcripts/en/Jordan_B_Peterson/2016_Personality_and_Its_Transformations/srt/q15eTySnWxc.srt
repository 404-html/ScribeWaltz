1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,770
Okay,
onto more trait conscientiousness.

2
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,640
Conscientiousness is a good predictor of
longterm life success.

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,860
It's a good predictor negatively up 
divorce.

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,770
So more conscientious people are less 
likely to get divorced.

5
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:33,130
It's a really good predictor of grades.
It's a decent predictor of income.

6
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,640
It's a good predictor of social status,
social status,

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,120
it seems to be particularly good at 
predicting outcomes for people who are 

8
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:48,121
engaged in managerial,
administrative and process management 

9
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:52,921
occupations.
And so all of those occupations are 

10
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:56,830
characterized by the necessity of 
reliability,

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,160
integrity,
and um,

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,280
attention to detail.
It's not associated with creativity,

13
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,260
right?
That's openness.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
So they opened.
People are better artists and 

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,010
entrepreneurs by all appearances.
So all together conscientiousness seems 

16
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:24,511
to be relatively positive trait.
And so then you might wonder why there's

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,690
a distribution,
right?

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,040
Like why isn't everybody hyperconscious?
Well,

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,880
it appears at least in part that as with
all the other personality dimensions,

20
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,750
there's increasing price to be paid as 
you deviate from the average.

21
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,560
And so unconscientious people,
they tend to rely on others to support 

22
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:52,981
them.
They're not particularly ambitious or 

23
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:52,981
reliable,

24
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,700
but they're not particularly rigid 
either.

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,080
And so one possibility might be that low
levels of conscientiousness are an asset

26
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,840
at certain times when combined with 
other traits.

27
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:12,841
So for example,
the data isn't all in on this yet,

28
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:17,620
but it seems to me quite likely that 
orderliness,

29
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:21,340
which is an aspect of conscientiousness,
conscientiousness,

30
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:26,341
breaks down into orderliness and 
industriousness and those actually seem 

31
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:30,601
to be importantly different think 
orderliness probably puts an additional 

32
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:37,021
constraint on creativity now.
So we've studied entrepreneurs for a 

33
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:41,101
long time and uh,
it's clear that higher levels of 

34
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:47,881
orderliness certainly aren't associated 
with entrepreneurial entrepreneurial 

35
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:51,511
capacity.
And I have the sneaking suspicion that 

36
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:54,541
that's because no orderly people are 
very concerned with doing whatever needs

37
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:58,240
to be done in the particular way that 
it's supposed to be done.

38
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:02,050
And the with that is,
is that if you're creative,

39
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,150
so if you're engaged in a creative 
enterprise,

40
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,980
the thing flipped around on you a lot.

41
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,100
Like there's a lot of transformations as
you're moving towards the end.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,150
And that's not exactly something in 
orderly person is going to appreciate.

43
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,750
I also suspect that orderly people are 
likely to.

44
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,600
There are two likely to obey rules to be
entrepreneurial or creative.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,180
Now obviously being rules has its 
utility,

46
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,140
right,
but it doesn't,

47
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:31,141
when the rules are wrong or when they 
start to interfere with something that 

48
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:34,360
might be conceptualized as higher,
a higher value than the rules themselves

49
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,440
for conscientious people,
it's not self evident that there are 

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,101
more important values then following the
rules and doing things properly and so 

51
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,880
you know,
that's part of what makes them reliable 

52
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:50,880
workers in decent citizens and all that 
sort of thing.

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,820
It's also partly what tips them towards 
conservatism on the political spectrum.

54
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:59,821
So the best predictors of political 
conservatism are low openness and high 

55
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:02,830
conscientiousness,
particularly orderliness.

56
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:06,970
So actually liberals and conservatives 
don't seem to be much different than one

57
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:11,971
another in terms of industriousness,
but they're quite markedly different in 

58
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:13,690
terms of orderliness or you know,
you could say,

59
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:18,691
well,
what predicts liberalism is high 

60
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,461
openness and low in conscientiousness,
particularly orderliness because you 

61
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:23,470
don't necessarily have to just be 
predicting con conservatism.

62
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,000
So

63
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,260
now

64
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,010
you remember the big two model.
So conscientiousness lumps in with 

65
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,040
emotional stability and agreeableness to
produce stability.

66
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,430
And as people age,
they become more stable,

67
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:45,860
they become more conscientious,
more emotionally stable,

68
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:47,380
and more agreeable,
and you know,

69
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:52,381
you'd probably interpret that somewhat 
pleasantly as an improvement in 

70
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:52,381
maturity.

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,100
So

72
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,280
and conscientiousness is quite highly 
correlated with neuroticism negatively.

73
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:02,700
So it turns out generally speaking,
that the more conscientious you are,

74
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:07,680
the less neurotic you are.
And we think that that might be actually

75
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:12,681
because of the tendency of 
conscientiousness as a trade manifested 

76
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:15,960
across time to stabilize environments.
You know,

77
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:20,961
so if you're a conscientious person,
imagine that because you're 

78
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:24,380
conscientious but not perfectionistic.
Let's say you stay on top of your 

79
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,210
homework and you get your assignments 
done,

80
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,180
let's even say ahead of time.
Well,

81
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:35,181
partly what that means is that the 
amount that you have to worry about how 

82
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:39,741
you're going to be doing decreases.
And of course if you're conscientious 

83
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:44,190
over time,
your field of opportunities opens up 

84
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,680
from an employment perspective,
plus your income increases and you've 

85
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,190
stabilized the environment around you.
And so there's less uncertainty in it 

86
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,460
and more security.
And so you know,

87
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:58,461
it could easily be that 
conscientiousness has its effect on 

88
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:58,530
neuroticism by stabilizing the 
environment.

89
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:03,531
Taking the uncertainty out of it and 
then making people not so much really 

90
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:08,511
less like lowered neuroticism,
but just less likely to be anxious and 

91
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:10,260
emotional pain in general.
So.

92
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,490
So here's some distinctions between 
orderliness and industriousness.

93
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,240
You guys can decide where you fit on 
these.

94
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,540
So if you're orderly,
you don't leave your belongings around 

95
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,050
you like order.
That's unsurprising one.

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,590
You keep things tidy,
you follow a schedule,

97
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,880
you're bothered by missy people.
You want everything to be just right.

98
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,370
You're bothered by disorder,
you don't,

99
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,960
you,
you like routine,

100
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,600
you see that rules are observed and you 
want.

101
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:49,601
Every detail is taken care of.
So the other thing you can kind of 

102
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:50,750
understand like what is the door to be?
People aren't that much fun,

103
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,870
you know,
and I also think that's relevant because

104
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,270
you know,
people have different kinds of social 

105
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,270
value,
right?

106
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,740
And sometimes you value people because 
of their ability to contribute perhaps 

107
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,331
from an economic perspective because 
they're hard workers and they're 

108
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:08,090
productive.
But when you think about Comedians,

109
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,570
comedians have a fairly high social 
value as far as I'm concerned,

110
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:14,240
but the probability that they're orderly
as a class,

111
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,940
it's pretty much zero.
It was.

112
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,950
People are high in high in extroversion,
clearly low in agreeableness,

113
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,040
generally speaking,
because you're just not gonna make rude 

114
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,250
comments about people to get a laugh,
which is what comedians do,

115
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:32,060
at least 50 percent of the time,
unless you're disagreeable and they have

116
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:37,061
to be pretty low in conscientiousness 
because like really a conscientious 

117
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,410
comedian,
is this just not going to happen?

118
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,480
The lifestyle doesn't lend itself to 
that,

119
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:42,110
right?
I mean,

120
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,510
it's erratic.
Your employment is going to be erratic.

121
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:47,120
The probability that you're going to be 
regularly employed is low.

122
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:52,121
You're up at night all the time.
You're always partying because that's 

123
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:53,080
the value that you're in.
Um,

124
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,380
and then you might,
you know,

125
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,180
you might think the same about people 
who are artistic performers,

126
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:00,320
like musicians.
You know,

127
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,360
if you want to be a rock musician for 
example,

128
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:07,361
when you're a teenager,
of course that makes you just a typical 

129
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,971
teenager in some ways.
But if you're going to pursue that into 

130
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:13,421
adulthood,
there's a lot of many more stable 

131
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:13,670
occupations that you have to forego,
you know,

132
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:18,671
when you have to be willing to adopt the
router erratic and unpredictable 

133
00:08:18,671 --> 00:08:19,430
lifestyle that would go along with 
being,

134
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:23,310
say a traveling musician and that also 
has to not make you feel bad.

135
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:28,310
And you know,
we don't exactly know what makes people 

136
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,630
industrious or,
or conscientious,

137
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,050
but avoiding feeling bad seems to be 
some seems to have something to do with 

138
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:40,361
it except that it's complicated a 
because the hypothesis fundamentally 

139
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:44,831
behind the big five traits analysis is 
that all the negative emotions load 

140
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:45,320
together on a single factor.
Right?

141
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:49,520
So that's fundamentally neuroticism.
So then you might say,

142
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:51,110
well,
if it's neuroticism,

143
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:56,111
that all the negative emotions are 
loading on what's leftover for the 

144
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:59,531
conscientious to use to feel bad with.
And we think that conscientiousness 

145
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:04,350
isn't a well understood.
Dementia,

146
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,530
like it's understood from a measurement 
perspective,

147
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,680
we can measure it quite accurately,
but mostly only using questionnaires,

148
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:13,740
either self report or other persons 
report.

149
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,350
We don't have any direct measures of 
industriousness.

150
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,890
And so and so that's kind of strange 
because it's such a potent phenomena 

151
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:27,000
that you think that you could come up 
with lab tasks that industrious people,

152
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:32,001
for example,
would do a better job that than non 

153
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:32,220
industrious people,
but we haven't been able to identify one

154
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:36,990
and we probably screamed 50 years 50 to 
75 different tasks,

155
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,140
never got any effect at all with 
orderliness.

156
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,790
Thought we've had more luck because what
orderliness seems to be associated with,

157
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,820
although not overwhelmingly powerfully,
is disgust,

158
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:54,891
sensitivity and so discussed,
seems to be an emotional access that's 

159
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:58,380
distinct to some degree from 
neuroticism.

160
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,270
And you know,
you might say,

161
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,560
well,
the disgusting things,

162
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,480
if you're too close to a disgusting 
thing,

163
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:06,720
you'd also get anxious,
and I think that's probably true,

164
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,960
but the emotion of disgust isn't the 
same as the emotion of anxiety or the 

165
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,610
emotion of pain.
Disgust,

166
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,150
a revulsion emotion.
It's a getaway for me.

167
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:23,151
Emotion.
Sometimes it's an emotion that will 

168
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:23,151
elicit anger,
defensive anger,

169
00:10:23,151 --> 00:10:27,291
to push something disgusting away or to 
be contemptuous of it or to roll your 

170
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,500
eyes at it.
Now,

171
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,710
here's an interesting little fact.
One of the best predictors of impending 

172
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:40,221
divorce is eye rolling,
so if you have a couple in therapy and 

173
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,240
you noticed that when one talks the 
other rolls their eyes,

174
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,420
you know that that's just not very good,
so that's something to remember in your 

175
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,420
own relationships.

176
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,050
If you're starting to roll your eyes at 
your partner,

177
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,100
you might think,
well,

178
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,280
that's a contemporary response.
That's a disgust response.

179
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,030
If you're starting to do that,
then it's either time to stop or time to

180
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:02,031
start looking for a new partner.
So now the orderliness discussed 

181
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,590
connection turns out to be theoretically
extremely interesting and we're going to

182
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,900
talk about that in some detail as we 
move forward,

183
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,930
but I'll go through industriousness next
and so an industrious person carries out

184
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,130
their plans.
Now,

185
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,010
that might be the critical element of 
industriousness.

186
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:23,430
So if you look at the general 
neuropsychological literature,

187
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:28,431
what you generally derived from that is 
that the prefrontal cortex is involved 

188
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:33,441
in behavior regulation because the 
prefrontal cortex is the part of the 

189
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:37,371
brain that people use to generate plans 
and dorsolateral prefrontal cortical 

190
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:44,070
function is primarily cognitive,
at least in so far as we've been able to

191
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:49,071
measure it,
and the cognitive abilities of the 

192
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:51,681
dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex appear 
to be quite tightly linked to fluid 

193
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:52,890
intelligence as we discussed before.

194
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,260
And so it also stands to reason to some 
degree that your ability to plan and 

195
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,290
your intelligence might be associated 
with your ability to carry out.

196
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Your plans are not to waste time,
and the cortex overall has been viewed 

197
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,190
as an organ that inhibits impulsivity.
But as we've discussed,

198
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,490
the idea that impulsivity is inhibited 
is probably not the world's most 

199
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,141
sophisticated idea.
It's probably more that impulsivity is 

200
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,041
unnecessary if you've developed a 
sufficiently sophisticated personality 

201
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:30,721
because you can get what you need to 
have through more complex and 

202
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:31,570
sophisticated means with less social 
conflict.

203
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,870
But anyways,
there's this idea that's been maintained

204
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:39,871
in the neuropsychological literature for
a very long time that the ability to 

205
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:44,890
plan is associated with increased 
control over impulsivity.

206
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:47,890
But the problem with that theory is that
it doesn't seem to be true.

207
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,780
So there is no correlation.
The correlation between intelligence and

208
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:54,400
industriousness is zero.

209
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And that's weird because man,
if you take intelligence and correlate 

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,431
it with something,
it's correlated with almost everything 

211
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:03,431
you know.
So even disgust sensitivity if,

212
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,940
if we measure disgust sensitivity and 
there's a variety of ways of doing that,

213
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,870
what we find is more intelligent people 
are less disgust sensitive.

214
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,640
So even,
and you know,

215
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,190
the connection there is by no means 
obvious,

216
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:20,191
right?
Because you could just as easily think 

217
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:21,040
that intelligent people would be less or
would it be more discussed sensitive,

218
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,310
but that hasn't.
That isn't how it is now.

219
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:29,311
The idea of carrying out your plans.
That's an interesting one because 

220
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:31,060
imagine,
think about what cognition is like,

221
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,480
especially abstract competition of the 
kind that we were talking about last,

222
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,120
last,
last class.

223
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,370
In order to abstract,
you have to separate the objects of your

224
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:45,820
internal manipulation from the world,
right?

225
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,920
So here,
here's an example.

226
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,920
So when you go to sleep at night,
there's a little switch,

227
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:55,270
for lack of a better term that shuts 
your body down.

228
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,120
And so what happens is that when you're 
dreaming,

229
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:03,121
of course you're dreaming about running 
around and you move your eyes while 

230
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:07,231
you're dreaming.
Now it turns out the motor systems that 

231
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:07,360
control your eyes are shut down because 
who cares?

232
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,610
You can move your eyes and still be in 
bed asleep,

233
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,670
not running around in your dream,
but if you take a cat or another animal 

234
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,961
and you destroy that off,
switch the capital run around and act 

235
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:21,490
out its dreams.
Okay?

236
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:23,950
So it's thinking is linked to its 
behavior.

237
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,140
So integrity that when it runs a 
simulation,

238
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,760
it's going to act it out.
Now,

239
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:32,761
human beings don't do that.
What happens when we think or we often 

240
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:36,931
don't do that?
There are times when we can avoid doing 

241
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:36,931
that.

242
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:38,080
You know,
when you think you sit there,

243
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,360
you generate up your world of 
abstraction,

244
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,200
you have your abstract representations 
and you manipulate them and so you might

245
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:49,201
think,
well this is what I'm going to do 

246
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:49,201
tomorrow.
You run a simulation in your head,

247
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:53,240
but you wouldn't be able to do that if 
you couldn't pull the simulated you away

248
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:54,680
from the actual view.
Right?

249
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,710
You have to divorce the representation 
from the thing it's representing in 

250
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,521
order to manipulate it abstractly.
So that opens up the possibility that 

251
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:07,670
you can think through things perfectly 
well without ever enacting your plants.

252
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,720
And that's actually what you see in the 
therapeutic realm.

253
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:16,721
If you have a client who's 
unconscientious you've got a real 

254
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:21,551
problem because the person won't do 
anything that they say they're going to 

255
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:21,551
do.
And so,

256
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,330
you know,
generally speaking,

257
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,380
especially for behavioral therapy,
what happens is that someone will come 

258
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,591
in with a problem and you discuss an 
array of potential solutions and you 

259
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:37,541
know,
an intelligent person could do that 

260
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,940
better than an unintelligent person and 
then you decide which of those potential

261
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:41,780
solutions might be implemented.

262
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,260
And then you wait.
You know,

263
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,420
you don't want to put too much of a 
burden on the person because you want to

264
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,190
make the probability that they'll 
actually implement the change very high,

265
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:57,191
so you do it quite slowly because people
aren't that good at implementing 

266
00:15:57,191 --> 00:16:00,580
behavioral changes and then you know,
hopefully the person comes back and 

267
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,021
says,
well I've tried this and here's the 

268
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:05,021
outcome,
and then you modify it accordingly.

269
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:07,220
It's called essentially called 
collaborative empiricism,

270
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,370
but the problem with doing that with 
someone who's unconscientious is they'll

271
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,400
come back and they'll say,
well,

272
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:14,960
I didn't get around to it.
It's like,

273
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,080
okay,
well what are you supposed to do about 

274
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,731
that?
It's like if the person doesn't get 

275
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:21,731
around to doing things,
that'll help.

276
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,960
How can you get them to get around to 
doing anything that'll help?

277
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:28,961
It's.
It's one of those flaws that seems to 

278
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:28,961
interfere with the process itself.

279
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,340
Now I could say,
well,

280
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,550
maybe you could make the person 
enthusiastic about it and they'd be 

281
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,580
driven by enthusiasm,
which is more of a positive emotion,

282
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:42,581
or maybe you could terrify them half to 
death by the negative consequences of 

283
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:44,300
not doing it,
which is also useful,

284
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:49,301
or maybe they're agreeable and so they'd
be willing to do it for someone else 

285
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,450
like there's other places or if they're 
open,

286
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:52,070
you can think of a creative way to do 
it.

287
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,110
There's other places you can get 
leverage,

288
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,370
but without the conscientiousness 
there's a real problem.

289
00:16:58,371 --> 00:16:59,930
It's really,
it's really difficult.

290
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,950
Okay,
so industrious and it seems to be 

291
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,601
associated with the ability or the 
willingness God only knows to take 

292
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:12,701
flammes that are formulated and then to 
implement them into behavior and to 

293
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:15,260
reinstate them voluntarily into behavior
and you know,

294
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,720
everyone knows that's a relatively 
difficult thing to do.

295
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,090
You know,
if you're trying to settle yourself down

296
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,310
to do a task,
especially one that you don't want to do

297
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,530
so you're not enthusiastic about it,
right?

298
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:27,320
That can carry you.
If you want to settle down and do a task

299
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:30,050
that you're not enthusiastic about.
That takes effort,

300
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,400
you know,
you could say it takes willpower and I 

301
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,811
actually think the conscientious person,
especially I think especially the 

302
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:42,371
orderly person is an addict,
is a person who admires willpower and 

303
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:46,490
that seems to be associated with 
something like due to fullness as a,

304
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:51,491
as a moral construct,
so a conscientious person will do 

305
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:54,471
something because they should do it or 
because they have a duty to do it and 

306
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:57,771
that's partly also why you see 
conscientiousness as an element of 

307
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,640
conservatism because conservatives tend 
to be more patriotic,

308
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:04,641
for example,
and they are more willing to think of 

309
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:07,020
their moral obligation in terms of 
service to the structured community.

310
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,180
Now we just did a factor analysis of 
conservative belief,

311
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:17,181
conservative versus liberal belief,
and one of my students is presenting 

312
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:17,181
that for her phd defense.
We,

313
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,210
we took a long time to do it about four 
years to really get the measures down 

314
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,911
and you know,
you hear about social conservative and 

315
00:18:25,911 --> 00:18:27,450
fiscal social conservatism and fiscal 
conservatism,

316
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:29,130
right?
So the social conservatives,

317
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,220
conservatives are usually in the,
in the states,

318
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:34,600
they're pro life.
They're,

319
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,780
they're,
they're,

320
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,500
they're usually not fans of gay 
marriage.

321
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,440
They're,
they're,

322
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,820
you know,
they're not advocates,

323
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:49,821
generally speaking of a welfare state,
they're against single parent families 

324
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,940
that you know,
so that's all social conservative dot.

325
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,090
It's like a moral,
it's a moral dimension of belief.

326
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,870
Whereas fiscal conservativism is 
something like don't run deficits,

327
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,310
you know,
if you want it to put it,

328
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:07,311
simply don't spend the government,
shouldn't spend any more money than it 

329
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:07,311
has.

330
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:11,990
And so that's an important principle,
but it also isn't an agent of economic 

331
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:13,710
development.
It's not really seen that way.

332
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:15,510
They're more like minimal government 
people,

333
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,560
but we got no evidence for a split 
between fiscal and social conservatism.

334
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:24,561
So I don't think it exists.
I think it's just a media invention 

335
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:28,310
because we did construct validation of 
the sort that I've been talking to you 

336
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,280
about what we got instead,
we're three factors.

337
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,240
We got masculine independence.
That's what we decided to call it 

338
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,321
because it was much more common among 
men and it Kinda looked like 

339
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:40,600
libertarianism,
which is a brand of conservatives,

340
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:45,630
which is basically you go and do your 
bloody thing and I'll do my thing and 

341
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,950
we'll either leave each other alone or 
if we don't,

342
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:49,560
we'll compete and one of us can win and 
that'll be just fine.

343
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,890
So it looked like.
So one of the things that's interesting 

344
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,860
about that,
and it really got me thinking was that,

345
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you know,
that classic explanation for why 

346
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,571
Conservatives are conservative is 
because they're afraid of they're 

347
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,240
afraid,
but there's just no evidence for that.

348
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,840
Conservatives are less neurotic than 
liberals by a substantial margin and you

349
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:15,841
know,
there is evidence that they have a 

350
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:15,841
negativity bias,
which I don't really want to explain,

351
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:20,800
but what that means sometimes is that 
they'll actually pay more attention to 

352
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,600
negative information rather than less in
comparison to liberal.

353
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:27,210
So what it means is not clear,
but the masculine independence dimension

354
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:32,211
is a very interesting one because it 
implies that there's a reason for 

355
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:35,781
hierarchy beyond structure.
You can't win unless you play a 

356
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:37,480
structured game.
So you know,

357
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,560
a lot of what the masculine,
independent types want is they want to 

358
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:42,930
say,
just get the damn rules straight.

359
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,750
I don't really care what they are,
but if you get them straight,

360
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:48,010
all follow them.
But that'll a hierarchy because,

361
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,360
you know,
as soon as you produce a value 

362
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,951
structure,
you produce a hierarchy because people 

363
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:55,960
compete towards fulfilling the,
you know,

364
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:01,050
they compete towards the end game and 
that'll immediately produce a hierarchy 

365
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,250
of,
of uh,

366
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,740
accomplishment,
let's say.

367
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:08,130
And then you might say,
well why would men be particularly 

368
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,281
motivated to do that?
And the answer seems to be because of 

369
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:12,790
hyperglycemia and Heiberger b is the 
tendency of women to make a cross her up

370
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:17,791
dominance hierarchies.
So the males compete with one another 

371
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:18,100
and they want to because they want to 
win.

372
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,580
Part of the consequence of winning is 
that they have much more success with 

373
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,520
women.
And that's a primary motivator.

374
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,210
So.
So that's interesting because it,

375
00:21:27,211 --> 00:21:30,790
it,
it provides a rationale for supporting a

376
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,700
relatively structured hierarchy that has
nothing to do with,

377
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,300
with,
you know,

378
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,620
having to deal with the negative 
consequences of not having a stable 

379
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,500
worldview.
It's more,

380
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:46,501
and you know,
there's another thing to think about to 

381
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:48,451
hear with regards to hierarchies.
It's like if you have an ideal,

382
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,420
you immediately have a hierarchy,
so if you,

383
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,480
because of course let's say that you 
have a bunch of children in gymnasium 

384
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,680
and you say,
well let's do somersaults to the other 

385
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:01,720
side of the wall,
you know,

386
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:05,140
there's an implication there and the 
implication is that you can be better or

387
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:08,200
worse at it,
so the kids will immediately compete,

388
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,800
especially the boys immediately compete 
to roll to the other side of the wall as

389
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:13,330
fast as they possibly can.

390
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,780
And so if you want it to get rid of 
hierarchy,

391
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:21,781
you'd have to get rid of values and that
seems like a really stupid thing to do 

392
00:22:21,781 --> 00:22:21,781
to me,
you know,

393
00:22:21,781 --> 00:22:25,890
because without values you have no 
positive motivation because you feel 

394
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,090
almost all your positive motivation in 
relationship to a goal,

395
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,420
right?
Because it's not attainment of the goal 

396
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:33,420
that makes people happy.
Generally speaking,

397
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,980
it's observation of the fact that their 
efforts are contributing to them moving 

398
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,060
towards a valued goal.
So okay,

399
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:42,610
so there's masculine independence.
That was one dimension.

400
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,540
Another dimension was basically 
religious traditionalism and then there 

401
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,330
was more women who were aligned with 
that,

402
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,660
which was interesting because we found 
more women on the far left of the 

403
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:54,660
spectrum too,
which I'll talk about in a minute.

404
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,220
So.
And then the last one was something like

405
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:59,540
ethnocentrism it,
which is like,

406
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,060
you know,
if you're not like us,

407
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:04,750
go away basically and so,
but none of those were fiscal,

408
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,750
social or none of them neither.
None of those were fiscal or social.

409
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,140
So that was quite interesting.
And it also shows you the utility of 

410
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,871
getting your measurements right,
because if you don't get your 

411
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:18,421
measurements right,
you don't even know what you're talking 

412
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:20,071
about.
And conservatism characterized along 

413
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:23,191
those three dimensions is a lot 
different than conservative as in 

414
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:25,180
characterized as fiscal versus social.
They're not the same phenomenon.

415
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,530
So.

416
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,540
Okay,
so back to the industrious person 

417
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,260
carries out his or her plans,
wastes time,

418
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,300
negative con.
Industrious.

419
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:40,600
People don't waste time.
So they stay,

420
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,900
they stay focused on their goal or they 
continue acting in relationship to their

421
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:48,650
goal.
That's more accurate.

422
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,320
Finds it difficult to get down to work.
No,

423
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:56,350
that isn't characteristic of industrious
people and you can see the willpower 

424
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:56,510
element to that to some degree,
you know,

425
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:01,511
you can tell yourself to sit down and 
work and you will so messes things up.

426
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:08,441
No,
that isn't what an industrious person 

427
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:08,441
does.
Finishes what he or she starts,

428
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:12,581
yes,
puts his or her mind on the task at 

429
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:15,431
hand.
So there seems to be an intentional 

430
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:17,351
phenomena there,
right is the person is able to focus in 

431
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:20,060
without distractions and gets things 
done quickly.

432
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,300
Well,
industrious people seem to be fans of 

433
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,611
efficiency and you can kind of see the 
relationship between the efficiency in 

434
00:24:27,611 --> 00:24:27,611
order.

435
00:24:27,611 --> 00:24:31,870
Although you can also see at times where
the demand for more efficiency would 

436
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,610
require the disruption of something that
was previously orderly.

437
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:37,650
So an industrious person and an orderly 
person might have a,

438
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,900
you know,
a dispute about that always knows what 

439
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:42,900
he or she is doing.
So that's again,

440
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,500
there's a kind of certainty and 
direction that's associated with that 

441
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:47,500
doesn't postpone.
Decisions,

442
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,360
isn't easily distract.
An orderliness is the big predictor of 

443
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,650
longterm life success.
Now orderliness is more predictive of 

444
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,660
success in jobs that require careful 
attention to the management of process 

445
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,621
so that if something has become 
something has been turned into an 

446
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:06,260
algorithm,
so that means there's a process by which

447
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:11,261
it might be done.
Then in order to have a person is very 

448
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:11,261
good at making sure that the,

449
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,590
that the,
you know,

450
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,950
the,

451
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,330
that the algorithm runs exactly as it's 
supposed to without error.

452
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,140
You see conscientious to this actually 
has quite a good predictor of scientific

453
00:25:22,141 --> 00:25:27,141
productivity because one of the things 
that science does in large part is 

454
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,680
reduce the reliance on intelligence and 
increase the reliance on 

455
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,560
conscientiousness.
I mean that's one of its powers,

456
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:39,561
right?
Because you can be a not spectacularly 

457
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:43,161
bright scientists,
but if you're good at methodology and 

458
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:44,190
you're detail oriented and you know the 
literature,

459
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,340
you can figure out what the next problem
is to solve it's micro problem because 

460
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,000
you know where the problems are.
And then science is like a,

461
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,720
almost like a meat grinder.
You know,

462
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,500
if you turn the crank properly,
you feed in raw information,

463
00:25:55,501 --> 00:26:00,501
you turn the crank property,
you're going to make the next tiny step 

464
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:05,391
forward,
so it's maybe the more open scientists 

465
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:08,401
to leap way the hell into the future and
completely transform a field at the 

466
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:12,561
level of fundamental presupposition,
but most of the scientists are just 

467
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:15,090
nibbling on the edges between order and 
chaos and you know,

468
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:16,500
it's a whole monstrous,
massive,

469
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,560
the moving forward tiny amounts at once.
And so that's partly what makes science 

470
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,980
extremely powerful.
Okay.

471
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,110
We don't know why people are 
industrious.

472
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,010
We can't figure it out.
I have a sneaking suspicion I told you 

473
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:37,811
that maybe part of it is that they,
they want to win within a defined 

474
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:41,680
framework and then that might be 
associated with hyperglycemia.

475
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,450
Now one of the things you see is that 
there is a gender difference between men

476
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,430
and women in relationship to 
conscientiousness,

477
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,030
conscientiousness overall,
but women are more orderly than men and 

478
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,841
men are more industrious than women.
And that kind of goes along with the 

479
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:58,530
hyper gummy.
So you remember hypergo is this tendency

480
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:01,350
that I described already,
that it's the case had many,

481
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:04,620
many among many,
many types of creature.

482
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,030
Um,
so there might be that as a motivation,

483
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:14,031
although I don't,
I don't think that you can simply say 

484
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:17,841
that men think that if they get 
successful they're going to have more 

485
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:18,750
luck with women.

486
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,680
Although that's certainly a conscious 
realization on the part of many men.

487
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,590
I think it's such a deep phenomenon that
it's built.

488
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:29,460
It's more like it's built into the 
motivational system a priority,

489
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,300
you know,
so anyways,

490
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,840
so that would go on the masculine 
independence front.

491
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,900
But,
but we still haven't been able to 

492
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,780
manipulate that with any,
to any great degree.

493
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,260
Maybe we're thinking as well that what 
conscientious people are doing is not so

494
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:53,511
much striving to get to the top as they 
are trying really hard to stay away from

495
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:56,940
the bottom.
And now I would go along with the,

496
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,800
with the orderliness,
industriousness overlap,

497
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,060
you know,
say if,

498
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,780
if I'm.
Part of what makes you orderly and 

499
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,450
somewhat industrious is disgust 
sensitivity.

500
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,840
One of the things that you might want to
do is flee from the bottom of dominance 

501
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,510
hierarchies because the bottom of the 
dominance hierarchy is a bad place to be

502
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:21,480
from the perspective of maintenance of 
health,

503
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:26,481
like people at the bottom of dominance 
hierarchies are generally speaking in 

504
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:30,411
much rougher shape than the people who 
are closer to the top and so part of 

505
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:34,550
being industriousness might want,
might be maybe you're motivated by not 

506
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,260
wanting to fail and then you might 
think,

507
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:38,280
well,
that's anxiety,

508
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,600
but maybe not.

509
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,370
You know,
conscientious people.

510
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:45,180
Let's say you have someone walking down 
the street and they encounter a homeless

511
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,240
person.
Okay.

512
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Is a conscientious person more or less 
likely to give the conscientious person 

513
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,410
money or give the homeless person to 
give the homeless person money?

514
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,410
What do you think?
No,

515
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:03,560
that's right.
No agreeable person that they'll give 

516
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,051
the person money to conscientious first 
and especially the one that Sorta 

517
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:09,060
hyperarousal or say get a job and they 
do that because conscientious people are

518
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:14,541
also more judgmental and that goes along
with with the hierarchical attitude.

519
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:17,240
I think they,
you know,

520
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:22,250
they genuinely run on the principal,
but being higher up in the hierarchy is 

521
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,560
better and that there's something wrong 
with you from a moral perspective if you

522
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:26,520
happen to be,
you know,

523
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,660
among the failures and so one 
possibility is that part of the reason 

524
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,991
that conscientious people,
industrious people are that way is 

525
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:38,751
because they judge themselves quite 
harshly and they really do not want to 

526
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:39,660
fail,
but it's not because they're anxious,

527
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:44,661
it's because they're disgusted self 
disgusted by the possibility that they 

528
00:29:44,661 --> 00:29:49,441
might count among the failures and so 
that grounded in an entirely different 

529
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:51,280
motivational system.

530
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:57,180
So now there's some other things about 
how about conscientiousness that are 

531
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:04,741
pretty interesting.
I think they're kind of revolutionarily 

532
00:30:04,741 --> 00:30:04,970
interesting.
So,

533
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,180
well the first thing I told you was the 
overall,

534
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,850
especially for industries.
We have no theoretical model,

535
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:14,851
no neuropsychological bottle,
no psychological model and no 

536
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:16,840
pharmacological model.
I could add to that no animal model.

537
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,380
So that's pretty damn weird because 
pretty,

538
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,540
pretty.
Almost always when you discover 

539
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:25,540
something psychometrically and it's 
stable,

540
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,000
you can start connecting it to other 
things that you've discovered.

541
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:28,420
Like,
you know,

542
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:33,421
extroversion is associated with 
incentive reward and neuroticism is 

543
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:34,940
associated with the anxiety systems and 
you know,

544
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,080
stability looks like it's associated 
with higher levels of Serotonin and 

545
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,591
openness looks like it's associated with
decreased latent inhibition and like we 

546
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:47,910
know we've got some insight into what's 
going on at other levels of analysis 

547
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:51,880
with regards to these traits.
Conscientiousness.

548
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:58,050
No.
Except for this connection between 

549
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,050
orderliness and discussed.
Yes.

550
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,420
Well that's a good question.
Are there conscientious animals?

551
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,740
You know,
that's a tough one.

552
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,970
You might say yes because sled dogs and 
that sort of thing.

553
00:31:08,971 --> 00:31:13,971
And,
and like Australian blue heelers first 

554
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:15,330
of all they're super intelligence so 
that is something to take into account,

555
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,940
but they also really seem to like to 
work,

556
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,510
but I would say they're probably more 
enthusiastic than conscientious,

557
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,460
you know,
because they love to work.

558
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,840
They're out,
they're wagging their tail.

559
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,600
It's like that's not what you're doing 
when you're doing telephone sales,

560
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:28,820
you know?
So yeah,

561
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,980
I like this idea of value more ideal.
So I mean,

562
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,990
I don't think animals has these kind of 
more route.

563
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,670
Well,
it's not obvious like,

564
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,990
because if you look at chimpanzees,
for example,

565
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,650
um,
the chimpanzees and other primates,

566
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:54,651
they have pretty stable dominance 
hierarchies there actually hereditary 

567
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:58,070
and the top primates are pretty rough on
the bottom primates and a lot of it 

568
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:01,110
looks like contempt.

569
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,120
So,
you know,

570
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,790
because what else would it be exactly,
you know.

571
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,210
But by the same token,
it's not that easy to generate an animal

572
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:11,280
model of disgust.
That's another problem.

573
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,350
Well,
I mean,

574
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:14,220
you think about dogs,
those bloody things,

575
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:16,170
they're not disgusted by anything,
you know,

576
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,160
they're enthusiastic about lots of 
things that no nothing in its right mind

577
00:32:20,161 --> 00:32:24,290
should ever be enthusiastic about.
So anyway,

578
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,130
so.
Okay,

579
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:30,090
so,
alright.

580
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,640
So overall,
if you're conscientious,

581
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,800
you're going to be more satisfied with 
your life,

582
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:37,890
especially as you progress through time 
and you're going to be more,

583
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,920
more happy,
you're going to be happier.

584
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,240
Which is funny because of course 
happiness is basically extroversion.

585
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:47,360
So you might ask what does that have to 
do with conscientiousness?

586
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:52,361
But what it seems to happen is that 
because of your conscientious across 

587
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:55,121
time,
your life actually stabilizes and gets 

588
00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:56,090
better.
And so even though you might not be more

589
00:32:56,091 --> 00:33:01,091
happy,
you'll be less miserable and they'll 

590
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:02,921
tell you,
if you give people a choice between les 

591
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:03,920
miserable and happier,
they'll take less miserable because it's

592
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:08,921
really painful to be miserable,
but it's only so it's only moderately 

593
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:09,770
good to be happy.

594
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,040
We have a much bigger capacity for 
negative emotion then for positive 

595
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,101
emotion.
So it's positively related to life 

596
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:22,811
satisfaction and happiness,
but it's also positively related to 

597
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:26,081
depression.
Conscientious people are more likely to 

598
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,230
get depressed now.
So there is part of the reason why there

599
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:29,330
might be some variation in 
conscientiousness.

600
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:31,820
So you might say,
well conscientious people do really well

601
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:36,821
when they're fully employed,
but if you fire someone who's 

602
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:40,211
conscientious,
they do not have a good time of it 

603
00:33:40,211 --> 00:33:43,390
because the judgmental part of their 
personality starts to wreak havoc with 

604
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,190
themselves,
you know,

605
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,790
because their attitude is if you work 
hard,

606
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,410
you can get ahead.
Right?

607
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:53,411
And so that's an index.
Your success is an index of your moral 

608
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:53,411
value essentially.
Well,

609
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:55,760
so then you lose your,
your employment.

610
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:57,560
What the hell are you supposed to 
conclude?

611
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:03,010
Well,
you couldn't conclude that the whole 

612
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,411
system is rotten,
but you're very unlikely to do that if 

613
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:05,760
you're conscientious because you're sort
of a patriotic type and,

614
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,480
and you know,
you,

615
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,560
you are,
you identify quite strongly with the 

616
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,380
structure of the system and plus,
you know,

617
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,070
conscientious people are very concerned 
with justice and they might think,

618
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:21,071
well,
if I'm going to have this attitude 

619
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:21,071
towards other people who failed,
you know,

620
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:24,791
who are unemployed,
let's say I have to have the same 

621
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:24,791
attitude towards me.

622
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:25,160
And so what you see with conscientious 
people,

623
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,110
if they're having,
you know,

624
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:32,111
maybe they've got laid off at work 
really through absolutely no fault of 

625
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:36,071
their own,
they are just torn up by it because one 

626
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:38,710
of the things they do that's different 
for an unconscientious person,

627
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,490
everything is always someone else's 
fault.

628
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,250
But for a conscientious person,
it's the opposite.

629
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:45,050
Everything is always their fault.
Well,

630
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:50,051
the problem,
there's an advantage to that because if 

631
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:50,360
you take responsibility for your 
situation,

632
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:55,361
then there's a possibility that you'll 
make whatever changes you can to improve

633
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:56,690
your situation.
You know?

634
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:59,150
So even if you're only 10 percent at 
fault,

635
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,200
if you take responsibility for that,
then you can fix that 10 percent and 

636
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,260
maybe things will work out better for 
you.

637
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:11,650
So you know there's some advantages to 
overestimating the degree to which 

638
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:11,780
you're at fault.
And if you say,

639
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:12,890
well,
it's the system,

640
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,270
well,
okay,

641
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,050
good,
fine,

642
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,890
go fix that.

643
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Like it's not gonna happen.
So it's not a very effective means of 

644
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,670
coping.
But in psychotic depression,

645
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:24,230
for example,
which is a very,

646
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:27,950
very extreme form of depression,
what you often see is that the depressed

647
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:32,951
person erroneously concludes.
It's like a metaphysical conclusion 

648
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,920
almost that their faults are integrally 
tied to the,

649
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,720
you know,
to everything that happens that's bad in

650
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:44,100
the world.
And so they take on all of the guilt for

651
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,470
everything that's gone wrong.
And obviously that's,

652
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,190
there's a point at which that's a 
relatively counterproductive conclusion,

653
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:55,250
you know,
and especially because often when bad 

654
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,731
things happen to you in life,
there's a random element and you know,

655
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,870
you can't really treat yourself properly
unless you take that random element into

656
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,970
account.
Now you can overestimate it,

657
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:10,971
which is what you do if you're under an 
unconscientious and you could could 

658
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:14,990
overestimate it if you're 
unconscientious and underestimated if 

659
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,650
you're conscientious and there's gonna 
be times when you paid for both of those

660
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:18,300
attitudes.
So anyways,

661
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,640
conscientious people don't do very well 
when they're,

662
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,300
when they're not doing very well because
they,

663
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,650
they,
they judge themselves very harshly.

664
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,450
So that's partly what,
and it's related to guilt.

665
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:36,130
It's not,
it's a funny thing because there's an 

666
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,170
element of guilt that's associated with 
conscientiousness to.

667
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,190
So conscientious.
People feel guilt less often,

668
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,200
but they're more sensitive to it.

669
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,880
So.
And then you think,

670
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:48,560
well that's kind of paradoxical.
It's not exactly paradoxical.

671
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:53,561
If you're sensitive to guilt,
you might arrange things so that you 

672
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:54,940
have nothing to feel guilty about and 
that's what conscientious people seem to

673
00:36:54,941 --> 00:36:57,490
do.
And so guilt,

674
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:04,020
guilt and shame seem to be emotions that
are integrally associated with 

675
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,730
conscientiousness and they're kind of 
difficult to disentangle it,

676
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,820
you know,
and maybe they're not even really 

677
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:11,860
separate things,
but shame seems to be something that you

678
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:14,860
feel when you fail,
perhaps in the eyes of others.

679
00:37:14,861 --> 00:37:19,861
And guilt is something that you feel 
when you fail according to your own 

680
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:23,791
standards,
and I know that that's kind of a messy 

681
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,011
definition,
but conscientious people do seem to be 

682
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,840
more prone to shame and guilt and those 
seem to be in principle,

683
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:34,470
mediated by different systems.
Then the systems that mediate anxiety 

684
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,550
and emotional pain,
but we don't know what the systems are 

685
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:42,600
now.
You can also think about it in 

686
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:42,920
relationship to something,
you know,

687
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:46,160
what to what the existentialists called,
like the existential burden.

688
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:51,161
So you know,
people are always doing things in groups

689
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,780
and

690
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,380
the groups are often oriented to,
to produce a certain outcome like a 

691
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,761
hunting party.
We could say that if we're thinking of 

692
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:04,761
it from an evolutionary perspective,
like there's a,

693
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:07,050
there's a,
there's a big goal and it's an important

694
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:12,051
goal and they're going to be good 
hunters and hundreds of that aren't so 

695
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:12,051
good.
And

696
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,650
part of the way,
and this is to think of a hierarchy as 

697
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:22,131
something other than a dominant tire 
because the dominance hierarchy theory 

698
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:25,671
is slightly flawed because it implies 
that the hierarchy is only based on 

699
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:25,671
power.
Right?

700
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:30,021
But that's not right,
like if you have a hunting party or a 

701
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:33,420
building crew or anything like that,
a lot of what elevates one man above the

702
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:35,440
other in the dominance hierarchy isn't 
power.

703
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:37,150
It's competence,
you know,

704
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:42,151
so the best hunter has the highest 
reputation or the best builder has the 

705
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:42,780
highest reputation or you know,
it depends on,

706
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:47,810
on what the hierarchy is devoted for.
But the person who's best at that rises 

707
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:47,810
to the top,
you know,

708
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,650
all other things being equal.
And that's often the case even if people

709
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:52,540
don't like them very much,
you know,

710
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:57,541
we've done investigations into corporate
structures where someone will be 

711
00:38:57,541 --> 00:39:01,720
approved by a relatively large majority 
of the people who worked for the company

712
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,230
because they're hyper competent,
but no one really likes no one.

713
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,250
So you can't really think of that as,
as you know,

714
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:12,340
either a popularity contest or something
that's based on power.

715
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,630
And I think that a decent hierarchies 
almost never based on power,

716
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,630
based on competence.
Now those two things get tangled up,

717
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,990
but well,
so then you think one of the things 

718
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,861
that's going to make people prone to 
being successful is to feel some 

719
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:36,301
responsibility in relationship to their 
capacity to attain a goal in a group 

720
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,900
situation.
And I think that's partly the origin of 

721
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,510
both conscientiousness and guilt and 
shame.

722
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:48,870
You know,
lots of times if you talk to unemployed 

723
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:48,870
people and uh,
you know,

724
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,090
we hear a lot about rates of depression 
and that sort of thing,

725
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:54,610
but what kind of boneheaded about the 
way we measure things.

726
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:58,090
Like if you want to be depressed,
the best thing to do is lose your job.

727
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:02,380
And then you really got to ask yourself,
are you depressed or are you unemployed?

728
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,240
You know,
those aren't the same thing.

729
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,620
You know?
And you might say,

730
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:08,590
well for some people unemployment 
doesn't make them depressed.

731
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:09,100
It's like,
well,

732
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:14,101
we know that that's the unconscientious 
people or maybe the unconscientious 

733
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:14,101
people and the emotionally stable 
people,

734
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:17,620
something like that.
But for the people who are conscientious

735
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:20,710
and also maybe somewhat neurotic man,
that's just going to wipe them out.

736
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,920
But to think about that as psychological
is rather foolish,

737
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,120
you know,
it's,

738
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,530
it's an actual loss and they're 
responding to it in a natural way.

739
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,740
And so,
you know,

740
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,230
I'm usually people who are unemployed,
I mean,

741
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:40,231
part of the reason that they get 
depressed is because they're worried 

742
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:40,231
about their future,
you know,

743
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:44,430
but that's not the only reason they 
often talk about is that they've let 

744
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:48,510
people down and so that would be people 
in their family or they let themselves 

745
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,171
down or they're performing underneath 
their capacity or they're just useless 

746
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:52,210
and are contributing.

747
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,590
And those are all places where you know,
their guilt will start to eat them up.

748
00:40:56,591 --> 00:41:01,591
And those are the sorts of things that 
seem also to be associated with 

749
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:02,110
conscientiousness.
And it's like the idea that you know,

750
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:05,830
you're part of a team of sled dogs and 
your,

751
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,740
you have a responsibility to pull your 
weight.

752
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:13,741
And if you're not pulling your weight,
then there's something contemptible 

753
00:41:13,741 --> 00:41:16,411
about you.
And if you happen to be one of those 

754
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:18,601
people who aren't pulling their weight,
then there's something contemptible 

755
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:18,601
about you.
Even if it's you making the judgment.

756
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,180
So and conscientious people are 
definitely more judgmental.

757
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:25,630
So for example,
if you read them,

758
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:30,130
if you tell them stories about people 
who performed various criminal and cause

759
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:35,131
I criminal acts and you get them to 
estimate the sentence that they should 

760
00:41:35,131 --> 00:41:38,120
be subjected to the conscientious people
will reliably,

761
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:43,620
you know,
put people in prison for longer periods 

762
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:43,620
of time.

763
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,510
They don't like violations of,
they don't like violations of norms or 

764
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,380
violations of rules.
And so and so,

765
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,420
you know,
so one of the reasons that people might,

766
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,350
that there might be a distribution and 
conscientiousness is like maybe when the

767
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:57,230
whole economy collapses,
which happens fairly frequently,

768
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,140
the conscientious people just wipe 
themselves out.

769
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:05,290
You know,
they're so depressed and so self 

770
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,700
judgemental and so crushed that they 
can't handle the,

771
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,730
the,
you know,

772
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:08,870
the,
what would you call that?

773
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:13,580
That's the very high variability.
That's not the word I was looking for.

774
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,690
So they get clipped off when things fail
because I'm conscientious person doesn't

775
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:22,691
really care.
And that's actually sort of almost like 

776
00:42:22,691 --> 00:42:25,601
the defining characteristic of an 
unconscientious person is they don't 

777
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:26,390
really care.
And that's an interesting thing too,

778
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:31,391
because it's often more fun to be around
unconscientious people than it is to be 

779
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:34,700
around conscientious people because it's
very hard to relax around people who are

780
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:36,950
really orderly and judgmental,
you know,

781
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:40,310
he can't even sit improperly or you get 
judged for it.

782
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,220
Whereas if you're in someone's house and
they're unconscientious,

783
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:48,450
you know,
and you throw your beer can on the 

784
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:48,450
floor,
they'll just laugh and throw their beer,

785
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,030
you know?
And so that's,

786
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:54,680
I think it's difficult to relax with,
with really hyper conscientious people.

787
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,570
It's probably difficult to have fun with
them.

788
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,180
I think it's difficult for them to 
relax,

789
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,220
you know,
they,

790
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:03,530
they tend like conservative people tend 
to read less,

791
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:04,850
you know,
and you might think,

792
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:07,720
well that might be associated with their
interest in it,

793
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:10,430
intellectual activity because they're 
also lower and openness.

794
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,480
But I think it's also because they 
regard reading as a waste of time,

795
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:18,230
not because they exactly regard reading 
as a waste of time,

796
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:21,890
but they feel guilty if they're not 
working and instead they're sitting down

797
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,900
reading a bus,
what are you doing sitting down reading 

798
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:26,900
a book.
You know,

799
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,120
there's work to be done and so they're 
very work oriented,

800
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,620
so okay,

801
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,490
orderliness is a good predictor of 
conservatism as we've already said,

802
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:43,690
and it's associated with disgust,
sensitivity and preference for order and

803
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:45,970
tradition,
not egalitarianism.

804
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,710
So then you think,
well,

805
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,730
where's the sanitarium motivations?
And they all seem to pile up pretty much

806
00:43:51,731 --> 00:43:56,731
on agreeableness.
So the conscientious people basically 

807
00:43:56,731 --> 00:43:59,260
say you can get ahead if you play the 
game properly and you abide by the rules

808
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:02,080
and you work and the agreeable people 
say,

809
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:07,081
well yeah,
but there's lots of people who can't 

810
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:08,911
really manage that and you know,
we're not just going to push them off a 

811
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:11,521
cliff.
They need to be taken care of and you 

812
00:44:11,521 --> 00:44:11,521
know,
the situation wasn't fair to begin with,

813
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,260
you know,
and,

814
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:18,090
and there's a battle between that all 
the time and there's a battle because 

815
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,140
agreeableness and conscientiousness are 
orthogonal,

816
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,860
which means that they actually traverse 
different ethics.

817
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,920
Right?
And they're not opposites on the 

818
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:28,920
continuum,
conscientiousness and agreeableness.

819
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,280
That's not it at all.
So,

820
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:32,300
and it looks like in order for,
you know,

821
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,700
in order for people to adjust to the 
world of human beings,

822
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,320
you have to be agreeable to some measure
and you have to be conscientious to some

823
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:43,560
measure and the question is how much of 
each and the answer is,

824
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:46,380
well it depends on the circumstances and
where you place yourself,

825
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,160
but at the same question applies to the,
to the polity at large,

826
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:54,300
how agreeable should it be versus how 
conscientious shouldn't be.

827
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,620
And that's a very,
very.

828
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:00,770
It's not a problem with a solution.
The solution is only to be derived from 

829
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:06,021
a continual dialogue say between the 
conscientious people at the agreeable 

830
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:09,120
people because the answer varies as the 
environment varies.

831
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:13,440
So you can come up with a,
an end solution to that problem.

832
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,610
So

833
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,550
you know the conscientious people.
So we'll say the conservatives for them,

834
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:24,230
for the sake of argument,
they liked hierarchies.

835
00:45:24,231 --> 00:45:29,231
They like order,
they like a game that everyone can play 

836
00:45:29,231 --> 00:45:32,711
in.
Some people can win and they make the 

837
00:45:32,711 --> 00:45:34,650
assumption that if you play properly in 
you in that,

838
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,890
that,
that you've done something good.

839
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:43,690
Well,
the problem is is that if you're 

840
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,110
steeping up the hierarchy enough,
no one gets to climate and then the 

841
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:49,601
whole bloody society starts to crumble 
and breakdown because the rates of 

842
00:45:49,601 --> 00:45:50,000
violence go way up.
So you can see there's a.

843
00:45:50,001 --> 00:45:53,960
there's an upper bound to the steepness 
of a hierarchy and so you might say,

844
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:56,470
well,
that's where conscientiousness hits it.

845
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,480
Limit hits its limit.
Or You could even say that's where 

846
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,700
meritocratic meritocracy hypothetically 
hits its limit because you know,

847
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:08,710
if you're intelligent and conscientious,
you're much more likely to rise to the 

848
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:09,530
top of a hierarchy.
Well fine.

849
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:14,830
Maybe you want smart,
hardworking people at the top of 

850
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:14,830
structures,
but if,

851
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,820
if it's steep like this,
well then

852
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,180
there's a point at which that isn't 
sustainable.

853
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:25,200
And so the hierarchy has to be flat and 
somehow you know no one,

854
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:27,570
but the problem is,
and that's also something that agreeable

855
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:32,571
people would say right off the bat.
So what about the strata at the bottom 

856
00:46:32,571 --> 00:46:36,051
or just above the bottom?
How are you going to ensure that they 

857
00:46:36,051 --> 00:46:37,140
don't fall right out of the game 
altogether?

858
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,440
Which is a perfectly reasonable,
a reasonable question.

859
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,900
And answer to that both those questions 
as well,

860
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:47,901
we don't know how to do that,
and so we're trying to solve that 

861
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:50,130
problem continually as we go along.
So orderly.

862
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:52,590
People also have harsh judgments and 
moral transgressions.

863
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:57,591
We talked about that.
Now there's an idea of a behavioral 

864
00:46:57,591 --> 00:46:57,591
immune system here.
Now this is a cool,

865
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,590
cool

866
00:46:59,450 --> 00:46:59,900
idea.

867
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:13,910
So disgust is considered to be one of 
the basic human emotions defined by a 

868
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,430
strong revulsion and desire to withdraw 
from and the listening stimulus or event

869
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,480
physically disgust as a company by 
distinct facial expression involving 

870
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,260
constriction of the oral and nasal 
cavities.

871
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:27,630
So it's something like that to close 
yourself off.

872
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:33,410
Evolutionary models of people make that 
face when they hear a dirty joke that 

873
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:37,471
they're really quite offended by 
evolutionary models of disgust proposed 

874
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:41,110
that is emotion helped to evolve,
evolved to help us avoid contaminated or

875
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:45,580
harmful foods or other potential sources
of disease such as sexual contact.

876
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,400
Now that's interesting,
you know,

877
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,440
because there's also an idea that floats
around the general culture and I think 

878
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,000
it's be more elaborated upon partly 
since the time of Freud,

879
00:47:55,001 --> 00:48:00,001
but particularly since the sixties,
that sexual disgust is culturally 

880
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:01,570
produced.
It's like you can just drop that idea.

881
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:06,870
It's not the case at all any more than 
discussed related to food is culturally 

882
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:07,810
produced.
Culture moves it,

883
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:13,050
but the disgust response to sexual 
contact and to food is extremely a 

884
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,720
powerful innately and you know that 
because otherwise everyone would always 

885
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,230
be sleeping with everyone else.
Like there has to.

886
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:25,231
Because obviously sexual contact is a 
primary motivator or something has to 

887
00:48:25,231 --> 00:48:28,580
regulate it and you might say,
well good sense is what should regulates

888
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:29,050
like.
Yeah,

889
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:30,070
right man,
good sense,

890
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:32,890
doesn't regulate good sense,
doesn't regulate anything,

891
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:38,430
and so there's no way that's going to 
happen is the regulator for sexual 

892
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,090
behavior and that's grounded in contempt
and disgust,

893
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:41,590
you know,
and we saw a lot of that in the,

894
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:47,100
in parts of the crumb video that we 
watched because the crumb brothers were 

895
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,970
always being the targets of contempt and
disgust.

896
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,560
So that's pretty rough.
But you know,

897
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,420
you got to think about why that is too.

898
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,480
It's sexually transmitted diseases are 
no joke,

899
00:48:55,990 --> 00:49:00,990
you know,
and we don't know how long human beings 

900
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:02,821
have been plagued by them,
but you can presume that it's pretty 

901
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:02,821
much since the beginning of time,
you know,

902
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:07,830
mean syphilis was imported from the new 
world to the old world and was very,

903
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:14,311
very hard on Europe.
It was one of the reasons that the 

904
00:49:14,311 --> 00:49:16,530
victorians were so strict in their 
sexual behavior because syphilis was a 

905
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,030
nasty disease until we know more or less
finally brought it under control.

906
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,030
It's quite susceptible to antibiotics 
and it was,

907
00:49:22,031 --> 00:49:24,220
you know,
transmissible to infants which is also a

908
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:27,100
major catastrophe.
And then of course a's,

909
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,280
which was the primary vector for the 
spread of AIDS was promiscuity and the 

910
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:37,210
virus evolved could capitalize on 
promiscuity because it does that and you

911
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,130
know,
that could easily wiped us out,

912
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:42,760
wiped out tens of millions of people.
And so,

913
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,780
you know,
we're pretty smart and got it under 

914
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:47,780
control pretty fast.

915
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,520
But you know,
in some ways it could have easily been 

916
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,790
otherwise.
And also AIDS turned out to be not that 

917
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:53,790
easy to catch,
you know,

918
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:58,140
you actually had to engage in sexual 
contact and generally you had to engage 

919
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,820
in sexual contact of a relatively 
nonstandard type because the,

920
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:08,190
the most typically used tissues are more
robust to the probability of infection.

921
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,850
So we have any,
any number of,

922
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:17,970
of there's any number of reasons for 
people to be disgusted by sexual 

923
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:18,700
contact.
So,

924
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:24,630
and that's something that has to be 
contended with in addition to its role 

925
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,920
in directly helping to expel harmful 
foods from the body discussed also forms

926
00:50:26,921 --> 00:50:29,180
an important component of the behavioral
immune system,

927
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:34,630
the suite of psychological mechanisms 
that aid in the detection and avoidance 

928
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,610
of potential contaminants before they 
can make contact with the body.

929
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:42,050
So there's the immune system,
right?

930
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:47,051
It attacks invading pathogens,
but there's an analog in your behavior 

931
00:50:47,051 --> 00:50:49,360
which is that you're unlikely to 
approach,

932
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:53,710
touch and consume anything that happens 
to be disgusting.

933
00:50:53,711 --> 00:50:55,990
And it's a weird system.
So for example,

934
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:01,550
um,
people are unlikely to want to touch a 

935
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:05,311
sterilized cockroach.
And I don't mean one that's unable to 

936
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:05,311
breathe,
you know,

937
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:09,001
I mean one that that's been treated in 
heated so that it's free of 

938
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:09,640
contaminants.
People don't like to do that.

939
00:51:09,641 --> 00:51:12,040
They won't eat and this will hardly come
as any surprise,

940
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,150
high quality chocolate molded to 
resemble dog feces.

941
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,170
And everyone laughs about that.
Right?

942
00:51:20,171 --> 00:51:21,790
Which is kind of an interesting 
response.

943
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:23,770
So like of course no one would do that.
Well,

944
00:51:23,771 --> 00:51:24,700
right,
exactly.

945
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:29,950
You know,
although you cannot attribute that to 

946
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:32,341
logic,
you can just attribute to the fact that 

947
00:51:32,341 --> 00:51:35,581
you know that if you were in that 
situation how you would feel and the 

948
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,300
first thing you would feel is certainly 
not hungry and then turned off,

949
00:51:37,301 --> 00:51:40,360
which is an interesting way of thinking 
about it because it turned off,

950
00:51:40,361 --> 00:51:44,620
it's essentially a sexual expression 
turned off and then you'd feel,

951
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,170
I think you'd feel like a moron,
so to speak,

952
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:52,171
if you ate it right it to yourself and 
to anybody who also happened to be 

953
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:56,431
around,
there would be something about self 

954
00:51:56,431 --> 00:51:57,961
contamination,
voluntary self contamination there that 

955
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:00,340
would make you appear really not very 
admirable or honorable.

956
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:04,480
It's something like that.
So now the question becomes,

957
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:09,481
and this is where things get tricky,
just exactly what should you be 

958
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:09,481
disgusted bart.

959
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:17,710
So here's another example.
So if you get people to spit into a 

960
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:17,710
tube,
you know,

961
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:22,130
to put saliva into a cup,
they will not take it back in their 

962
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:22,130
mouth,
don't you think?

963
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:26,831
Well that's kind of strange too.
It's like you know what the cup is 

964
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:26,831
sterilized will say,
you know,

965
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:27,260
sterilized while it was just in your 
mouth,

966
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:30,560
like half a second before,
what the Hell is wrong with it now?

967
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:34,160
And the answer is it's no longer in your
mouth and you know,

968
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:39,190
so there's a,
there's an identification of the 

969
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,540
exterior of the body envelope as one of 
the things that defines you and not you.

970
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,730
And you know,
the immune system per se.

971
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:48,731
There's always defining you and not you 
getting rid of things that aren't you 

972
00:52:48,731 --> 00:52:50,660
and keeping the things that are you.
And that's extended out to our behavior.

973
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:52,280
So you can get.

974
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:58,120
Here's the sorts of things that Jonathan
Haidt has been a discovery hate was 

975
00:52:58,281 --> 00:53:01,340
really the guy who did the first major 
work on discussed.

976
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,450
It's a big deal,
man,

977
00:53:02,451 --> 00:53:04,500
like two thumbs up for him.
Um,

978
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:09,260
he's discovered something genuine,
inducing disgust responses,

979
00:53:09,261 --> 00:53:11,420
whether it via a foul order,
a disorder,

980
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:15,230
a disgusting work environment,
or recalling a disgusting experience led

981
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:20,231
individuals to assign harsher 
punishments to others who had committed 

982
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:24,101
moral transgressions.
So that's interesting because what it 

983
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:24,440
also means is that the sense of 
disgusting,

984
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:29,560
at least part is that the core of what 
we might describe as our desire for 

985
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,711
justice,
so which we tend to take as a primarily 

986
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:37,310
cognitive thing,
but most of the things that we do and 

987
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,720
hold dear are not primarily cognitive.
They're grounded in,

988
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:45,070
you know,
phenomena that are deeply embedded 

989
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:48,651
within us.
Harsh moral judgments can even be 

990
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:51,150
induced following the consumption of a 
bitter drake well,

991
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:56,530
poisonous things are often bitter even 
though bitter things are sometimes not 

992
00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:01,521
poisonous and the bitter flavor evokes,
discussed the same disgust related 

993
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:05,310
facial expressions or observed in 
response to unpleasant tastes,

994
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:10,290
disgusting photographs and receiving 
unfair treatment in an economic game.

995
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,200
So that basically means that if you're 
playing imagined,

996
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:17,490
some kids are playing together and one 
of the kids cheese or you might say,

997
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:19,830
well the other kids are going to be 
angry or they other kids are going to be

998
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:24,831
upset or the other kids are going to be 
anxious because they've upset the 

999
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:24,831
structure of the game.
It's like,

1000
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:25,290
okay,
maybe all those things happen,

1001
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,470
but one thing that happens as well as 
discussed,

1002
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:32,040
it's like how could you do that?
And then of course if you're disgusting,

1003
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:37,190
the probability that you're going to get
shunted out of the dominance hierarchy 

1004
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:37,290
altogether is pretty damn high.

1005
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:43,100
Concerns about cleanliness and feelings 
of disgust have likewise been related to

1006
00:54:43,101 --> 00:54:46,670
political attitudes,
situational situational reminders of the

1007
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:51,671
importance of physical cleanliness,
such as asking participants to wipe 

1008
00:54:51,671 --> 00:54:54,770
their hands with antiseptic wipes tends 
to increase self reported.

1009
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,800
Political conservatism,
such a finding is consistent with the 

1010
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,320
notion that purity tends to be valued 
more highly by conservatives.

1011
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,240
Then by liberals,
well for much of human history,

1012
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,320
female virginity in particular was 
highly valued and sometimes the 

1013
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,500
punishments for deviating from that were
and still can be extraordinarily high.

1014
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,830
Well,
part of the reason why you might ask why

1015
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:26,120
precisely is that,
and part of the reason is an exaggerated

1016
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:31,121
disgust response.
Individuals who report being disgusted 

1017
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:36,611
more easily also tend to hold more 
conservative political views on topics 

1018
00:55:36,611 --> 00:55:37,310
including abortion,
gay marriage tax cuts,

1019
00:55:37,311 --> 00:55:41,120
and affirmative action in addition to 
the effects that have emerged when using

1020
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:46,190
self-reported disgust sensitivity,
more conservative political views have 

1021
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:49,841
also been associated with stronger 
physiological reactivity to disgusting 

1022
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:54,160
images.
Yeah,

1023
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:10,291
so preferences for order and tradition 
on the one hand in preferences for 

1024
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:14,341
egalitarianism on the other appear to be
related to two core dimensions of moral 

1025
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:16,960
values.
So the,

1026
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,500
um,
preferences for order and tradition are 

1027
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,351
associated with higher levels of 
orderliness and as well as lower levels 

1028
00:56:25,451 --> 00:56:30,451
of openness and intellect and 
preferences for egalitarianism are 

1029
00:56:30,451 --> 00:56:32,380
uniquely associated with compassion and 
aspect of agreeableness.

1030
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,600
Political conservatism.
Now this is where the claims get 

1031
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,050
frightening.
I think political conservatism can be 

1032
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:45,991
thought of as a social immune system 
reflecting the extension of pathogen 

1033
00:56:45,991 --> 00:56:47,830
avoidance mechanisms to the integrity of
the social system,

1034
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,280
just as the behavioral immune system has
been conceptualized as helping to 

1035
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,400
maintain the purity and integrity of an 
individual body.

1036
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:59,550
So to me,
the same pathogen avoidance system 

1037
00:56:59,550 --> 00:56:59,980
helped me in the abstract integrity of 
the social order.

1038
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:05,340
In particular,
the social immune system would help to 

1039
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,100
maintain order by suppressing any 
actions or individuals that deviate from

1040
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:08,140
the groups,
accepted social traditions.

1041
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:12,490
Okay.
Now we're going to make a bit of a segue

1042
00:57:12,491 --> 00:57:15,220
here from this.
It has been reported,

1043
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:20,221
for instance,
that's that regions with higher levels 

1044
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:22,621
of disease prevalence tend to be 
associated with higher levels of social 

1045
00:57:22,621 --> 00:57:25,891
conformity and autocratic rule.
Individuals who feel more vulnerable to 

1046
00:57:25,891 --> 00:57:27,790
disease likewise report higher levels of
ethnocentrism,

1047
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,850
xenophobia.
Now that's something else to consider,

1048
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:36,180
so I don't know if you know this,
but when the Spaniards landed in Central

1049
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:39,400
America,

1050
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:41,930
they had

1051
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:47,620
being from a European population that 
was Ponson traded in cities and the 

1052
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,970
cities were,
from our perspective,

1053
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:55,180
disgusting,
filthy close proximity with animals and 

1054
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,210
subject to continual waves of epidemic 
disease.

1055
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,730
Now,
the upside of that for the Europeans was

1056
00:58:01,731 --> 00:58:06,731
that all the ones that didn't die 
developed immunity to these various 

1057
00:58:06,731 --> 00:58:07,760
diseases,
even though you know,

1058
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,520
I would suspect that over time it was 
the majority of people who died from one

1059
00:58:13,521 --> 00:58:16,400
epidemic disease or another.
Well,

1060
00:58:16,401 --> 00:58:19,580
so then the Spaniards went to the new 
world.

1061
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,580
Well,
for one reason or another,

1062
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:25,160
there were hardly any epidemic diseases 
in North America.

1063
00:58:25,161 --> 00:58:30,161
Now that was partly because of a 
relative dearth of domestic animals and 

1064
00:58:30,161 --> 00:58:31,910
partly because there weren't as many big
closely packed cities,

1065
00:58:31,911 --> 00:58:36,911
but you know,
God only knows what the overall reason 

1066
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:36,911
was.
So what happened?

1067
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:42,400
All the native Americans died.
Ninety five percent of them.

1068
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,730
They died from smallpox.
They died from measles.

1069
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:50,731
They died from mumps.
That guide from chicken pox in 

1070
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:54,481
successive waves of epidemic demolish,
meant centered in Central American 

1071
00:58:56,681 --> 00:59:01,681
rating out all across North America and 
South America so that by the time the 

1072
00:59:01,681 --> 00:59:03,180
Europeans landed in,
because the Spaniards got there,

1073
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:06,100
say in the late 14 hundreds,
right early 15 hundreds.

1074
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:09,010
And so the,
the people who landed at Plymouth Rock,

1075
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:14,011
and that's kind of often what you think 
about as the beginning of the European 

1076
00:59:14,011 --> 00:59:16,600
colonization of North America.
That was like 100 years later.

1077
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,830
Well everyone was dead by that.
And there are reports that when the,

1078
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:25,890
when the,
when the white settlers that religious 

1079
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,070
escapees really landed at Plymouth rock 
the Datas,

1080
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:32,080
we're happy to see them because there 
weren't enough people left bringing the 

1081
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:32,080
crops.

1082
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,090
So.
So why am I telling you this?

1083
00:59:34,091 --> 00:59:36,250
Well,
and then returned syphilis was delivered

1084
00:59:36,251 --> 00:59:38,230
to Europe.
At least that's the theory,

1085
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:40,460
although it's not,
you know,

1086
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:46,050
there isn't any certainty about that,
but it seemed to appear at about the 

1087
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:46,390
same time.
So the Europeans brought endless numbers

1088
00:59:46,391 --> 00:59:51,391
of horrible diseases to the new world 
and then the new world returned the 

1089
00:59:51,391 --> 00:59:52,750
favor with one horrible disease.
But there's a point here,

1090
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,790
while I'm still in,
this still happens,

1091
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:59,791
so if you go into the Amazon,
you find your tribe that hasn't been 

1092
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:03,211
discovered yet or anywhere else in the 
world and you go up and you shake their 

1093
01:00:03,211 --> 01:00:03,211
hand.
It's like,

1094
01:00:03,211 --> 01:00:04,200
that's great,
but they're all dancing like a month.

1095
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:07,690
So.
So why is this important?

1096
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:13,140
Well,
we don't know how often this sort of 

1097
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,451
thing has happened in the past,
and so it could easily be the case that 

1098
01:00:15,451 --> 01:00:19,500
part of the reason that people are leery
of people who aren't like them is 

1099
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,820
because over our evolutionary,
the course of our evolutionary history,

1100
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:27,060
it was at least moderately probable that
you read if you ran into another group 

1101
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:31,801
of people,
even if they didn't kill you and you 

1102
01:00:31,801 --> 01:00:34,471
immediately went to war,
that the mere contact would devastate 

1103
01:00:34,471 --> 01:00:34,471
you.

1104
01:00:34,471 --> 01:00:39,270
You know,
when you can imagine how that sort of 

1105
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,020
thing would be attributed to things like
magical power of curses or whatever have

1106
01:00:41,021 --> 01:00:46,021
you,
when people are trying to strive for an 

1107
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:47,941
explanation for the phenomenon.
So that's a nasty little idea.

1108
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:55,830
Now check this out.
So this study,

1109
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,950
according to a parasite stress 
hypothesis,

1110
01:01:05,951 --> 01:01:10,951
authoritarian governments are more 
likely to emerge in regions 

1111
01:01:10,951 --> 01:01:12,190
characterized by a high prevalence of 
disease causing pathogens.

1112
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:15,820
Recent cross national evidence is 
consistent with this hypothesis,

1113
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:19,180
but there are inferential limitations 
associated with that evidence.

1114
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,960
We report to studies that address some 
of these limitations and provide further

1115
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:27,961
tests of the hypothesis.
Study one revealed that parasite 

1116
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:32,790
prevalence strongly predicted cross 
national differences on measures 

1117
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,060
assessing individual's authoritarian 
personalities,

1118
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:39,360
and that this affects the tedious 
statistically mediated the relationship 

1119
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,630
between parasite prevalence and 
authoritarian governance.

1120
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,190
Okay,
so let's unpack that.

1121
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:47,220
What does it mean more disease?
The more the people are authoritarian,

1122
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,560
the more the people are authoritarian at
the local level,

1123
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,360
at the level of their individual 
beliefs,

1124
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,910
the more likely the government is to be 
authoritarian.

1125
01:01:55,210 --> 01:02:00,010
So it's disease individual,
government,

1126
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,520
right?
So that's really something study to 

1127
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,940
tested the parasite stress hypothesis.

1128
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,640
In a sample of traditional small scale 
societies,

1129
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:14,910
revolt results revealed that parasite 
prevalence predicted measures of 

1130
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:19,021
authoritarian governance and did so 
evenly when even when statistically 

1131
01:02:19,021 --> 01:02:21,120
controlling for threats to human 
welfare,

1132
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:26,070
one additional threat famine also 
uniquely predicted authoritarianism.

1133
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:31,730
Yeah,
but I should also point out that the 

1134
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:33,561
historical reasons for famine,
we're often tightly associated with the 

1135
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:34,530
historical reasons for disease 
prevalence,

1136
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:39,531
so you know,
if you were invaded by racks that are 

1137
01:02:39,531 --> 01:02:41,701
going to eat everything that you 
produced and the probability that 

1138
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:41,970
they're going to bring disease along 
with them was pretty damn high.

1139
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:47,390
Look at the correlations together.
These results further substantiate the 

1140
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:51,051
parasite stress hypothesis of 
authoritarianism and suggested that 

1141
01:02:51,051 --> 01:02:54,561
societal differences in authoritarian 
governance result in part from cultural 

1142
01:02:54,561 --> 01:02:56,160
differences in individual's 
authoritarian personalities.

1143
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:02,260
Okay.
What's the correlation between 

1144
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:02,260
authoritarian governance and pathogen 
prevalence?

1145
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:07,160
Point four,
to remember what we said about effect 

1146
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:07,160
sizes.

1147
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:11,040
That's as powerful an effect as the 
relationship between Iq and grades.

1148
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:16,730
It's a whopping effect and you know,
there's a lot of error in these 

1149
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:19,821
measurements so you can be sure that the
true correlation is higher famine was 

1150
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:22,860
also associated with authoritarian 
governance.

1151
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:26,550
Um,
so wow,

1152
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,630
I read that paper and I thought really,
could that really be the case?

1153
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:35,631
Is that what happens is that especially 
as the incidence of transmissible 

1154
01:03:35,631 --> 01:03:39,501
diseases increase,
people clamp down on their moral 

1155
01:03:39,501 --> 01:03:40,050
structures.
They don't let you know.

1156
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:43,770
They don't allow contact between each 
with between.

1157
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:46,290
They tightened the borders at every 
level,

1158
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,300
at every level.
Sexual,

1159
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:50,670
personal,
familial,

1160
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,580
at the level of the village,
at the level of the state,

1161
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:58,640
they closed the borders.
You know when you can think of the 

1162
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:58,710
ultimate border as the surface of your 
skin?

1163
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,420
No,
it is very few people.

1164
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:05,630
There are very few people who believe 
that border should be so open that they 

1165
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,940
don't want control over the border of 
their own skin.

1166
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,770
And then you might say,
well,

1167
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:13,500
how far out should that be extended in?
The answer to that is,

1168
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:14,610
well,
that's debatable,

1169
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:20,180
but there's obviously a limit on 
universality of access and there's a 

1170
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:24,150
reason for that.
I mean,

1171
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,700
there's multiple reasons for it,
but this appears to be one of them.

1172
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:29,010
So you know,
one of the things that indicates,

1173
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:31,800
and this is mind boggling,
who would have guessed this,

1174
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:37,070
is that perhaps the best way to fight 
authoritarianism across the world is to 

1175
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:41,211
institute effective public health 
programs and get rid of the infectious 

1176
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:41,550
diseases.
Now who would have guessed that?

1177
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,650
But you know,
it,

1178
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:47,810
it makes sense to some degree if the 
general level of danger and threat is 

1179
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:53,780
actually lowered,
maybe people don't have to be so 

1180
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:56,220
defensive and you know,
and judgmental and,

1181
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:59,630
and xenophobic.
You know,

1182
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:05,630
we think often that it's political 
argumentation that does this sort of 

1183
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:05,630
thing.

1184
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:08,130
But you know,
there's no malaria in North America.

1185
01:05:08,131 --> 01:05:10,240
There is no malaria in Europe.
There was,

1186
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:11,910
you know,
200 years ago,

1187
01:05:11,911 --> 01:05:13,110
Washington,
Boston,

1188
01:05:13,111 --> 01:05:15,840
those places were malarial pits,
you know,

1189
01:05:15,841 --> 01:05:18,770
but it was public health programs that 
got rid of almost all of that.

1190
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:24,010
So maybe we're all liberal and friendly 
because we don't have any infectious 

1191
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:24,010
diseases.
Would not be something.

1192
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,490
But you know,
our point four,

1193
01:05:26,491 --> 01:05:28,610
two correlation.
This was a big study to,

1194
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:31,880
that's a big correlation.
I've never seen a correlation like that.

1195
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:36,380
Especially think about the probability 
that those things would be related,

1196
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:37,970
right?
One's a self report,

1197
01:05:37,971 --> 01:05:42,971
measure of political belief and the 
other is a public health measure of 

1198
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:46,421
disease prevalence and the probability 
that those things would be associated 

1199
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:46,880
just fight.
You know,

1200
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,990
you would just never guess that unless 
you came to it the hard way through this

1201
01:05:50,991 --> 01:05:54,650
entire logic that we just discussed.
Okay.

1202
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:55,920
So,

1203
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:02,500
so,
well,

1204
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:07,501
I was going through this literature.
I was also reading Hitler's table talk 

1205
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:11,671
and Hitler's table talk was a collection
of his spontaneous speeches delivered 

1206
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:17,040
over the dinner table from 1939 to 1942,
which was roughly the period where the 

1207
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:21,541
Nazis were winning the war.
And I noticed something that I haven't 

1208
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:25,321
noticed before and what I noticed before
was that Hitler had a very powerful 

1209
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:28,030
behavioral immune system.
And so what did that mean?

1210
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,430
So,
you know,

1211
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:32,050
you often hear that the Nazis 
annihilated that.

1212
01:06:32,051 --> 01:06:35,440
The people that they annihilated because
they were afraid of them,

1213
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:38,140
let's say.
But then you think about Nazis,

1214
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:39,310
you know,
and you think,

1215
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:41,500
yeah,
maybe fear wasn't there.

1216
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:43,990
Overwhelming characteristic,
you know,

1217
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,810
it's some more like brutality or 
something like that.

1218
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:51,811
But it's not fear there.
You don't picture them trembling in 

1219
01:06:51,811 --> 01:06:51,811
their boots,
you know,

1220
01:06:51,811 --> 01:06:52,330
down in the basement or something like 
that.

1221
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:54,400
It's not that.
So.

1222
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,970
Okay.
So anyway,

1223
01:06:55,971 --> 01:07:00,971
so I was reading this book and Hitler 
was very high in openness by the way,

1224
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:08,080
and very high in orderliness by all 
appearances and so he his vision for the

1225
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:09,970
area and race.
So he had this race,

1226
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,080
racial theory,
right,

1227
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:16,081
and the racial theory was that the 
proper inhabitants of Europe and 

1228
01:07:16,081 --> 01:07:19,530
hypothetically the world were blond,
blue eyed areas which,

1229
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:25,340
which is really not a category and that 
and that the world would be a better 

1230
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:30,760
place if they were the dominant group 
and all the other groups were gone.

1231
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:36,360
Also then you think,
well how did Hitler conceptualize this 

1232
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,811
area and rates,
and the answer is he conceptualized it 

1233
01:07:39,811 --> 01:07:42,811
as a body.
It was the body of the was the body of 

1234
01:07:42,811 --> 01:07:47,011
the area and race and then he 
conceptualized all the people that he 

1235
01:07:47,011 --> 01:07:49,150
was out to annihilate as parasitical 
invaders.

1236
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:54,780
And so Hitler's metaphor for the Nazi 
genocide wasn't fear.

1237
01:07:56,440 --> 01:08:01,440
It was discussed.
And that's a whole different idea.

1238
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:06,240
Now let me tell you some things about.
Oh,

1239
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:09,100
in with regards to the orderly part.
Well,

1240
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,480
you can just check out the

1241
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:12,860
what

1242
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:23,700
you know,
you're just not going to see a more 

1243
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:23,700
orderly gathering the people than the 
picture on the right.

1244
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,310
You know,
at Nuremberg,

1245
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:30,311
which was the prime place where the Nazi
staged their celebrations was the 

1246
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,220
biggest gathering field ever made in 
human history.

1247
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:39,850
People arrange themselves,
hundreds of thousands of people into 

1248
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:40,850
perfect squares,
everything,

1249
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:45,910
and you remember the Jackboot goosestep 
March and the Hail Hitler.

1250
01:08:46,161 --> 01:08:51,161
It's like it's all done an absolutely 
perfect sequence and Hitler was a great 

1251
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:53,990
admirer of willpower.
He was very happy that he could stand in

1252
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:58,991
the back of his car for eight hours and 
keep his hand out like this and he 

1253
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:02,720
bathed four times a day.
So what you saw,

1254
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:08,020
what seems to have driven what happened 
in Nazi Germany and perhaps is one of 

1255
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:13,361
the things that drive right wing 
political movements to this day is 

1256
01:09:13,361 --> 01:09:15,020
heightened sensitivity to discussed.

1257
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:22,230
Now,
here's how it all got going and this is 

1258
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:24,991
a very brief overview and many other 
things happened when Hitler came to 

1259
01:09:24,991 --> 01:09:27,030
power and that was about 1933 
thereabouts.

1260
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:32,790
He put into place a variety of public 
health initiatives and one of them for 

1261
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:37,471
example,
was he built these vans that had x ray 

1262
01:09:37,471 --> 01:09:41,011
machines in them and he went around 
everywhere and screen people for 

1263
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:41,470
tuberculosis seemed like a good thing.
Okay.

1264
01:09:41,471 --> 01:09:46,471
And then one of the things he did after 
that was go on a factory beautification 

1265
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,640
being punished,
so to speak.

1266
01:09:48,641 --> 01:09:53,641
And so partly that was driven by 
openness because he wanted things to be 

1267
01:09:53,641 --> 01:09:57,031
aesthetically pleasing,
but a lot of it was driven by 

1268
01:09:57,031 --> 01:09:59,251
orderliness.
So you're supposed to go into your 

1269
01:09:59,251 --> 01:10:01,411
factory and sweep the damn thing out and
fix the yard in front of it and plant 

1270
01:10:01,411 --> 01:10:02,050
some flowers and you know,
make it a look.

1271
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:05,470
All Nice and suburban and under control.
All right?

1272
01:10:05,471 --> 01:10:06,390
So that was,
you know,

1273
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:10,660
maybe still not such a bad idea,
but you know,

1274
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:13,960
when you go into your factory while 
there's rats there and there's like bugs

1275
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:16,000
and things that shouldn't be there.
And so maybe you think,

1276
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:17,740
well let's get rid of the rats and the 
bugs.

1277
01:10:17,741 --> 01:10:22,741
And so then you use an insecticide spray
and that spray happened to be Zyklon B,

1278
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:28,470
which will return to you momentarily 
while so after that then hit their 

1279
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:31,800
window,
a euthanasia kick and it was sort of 

1280
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:31,800
like,
you know,

1281
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,750
we can get rid of the people who are not
contributing and you know,

1282
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:39,280
who are not fit to live,
shall we say.

1283
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:45,030
And so that started with euthanasia and 
so it started with people who were in 

1284
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:48,451
mental hospitals for example,
and people who had biological 

1285
01:10:48,451 --> 01:10:52,081
intellectual deficits and such.
And from there it went to people have 

1286
01:10:52,971 --> 01:10:55,730
the wrong religious tradition and from 
there,

1287
01:10:55,731 --> 01:11:00,731
and that was first of all,
only being rounded up and herded into 

1288
01:11:00,731 --> 01:11:00,731
camps,
let's say,

1289
01:11:00,731 --> 01:11:04,271
or first deprived of your property and 
have your identity and then rounded up 

1290
01:11:04,271 --> 01:11:07,841
and put and put into camps.
But what it ended up with was genocidal 

1291
01:11:07,841 --> 01:11:11,000
annihilation in gas chambers with Ziflow
on B.

1292
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,800
Right?
And so,

1293
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,200
you know,
the Nazis would describe the people that

1294
01:11:16,201 --> 01:11:21,201
they were tormenting as parasites and as
insects and as rats.

1295
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:28,320
And that's not fear language,
that's discussed language.

1296
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,890
And so it's an appalling

1297
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,580
paradox because the behavioral immune 
system,

1298
01:11:38,581 --> 01:11:43,581
along with the immune system is clearly 
designed to stop people from dying right

1299
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,730
in your immune system,
distinguishes between you and not you,

1300
01:11:47,731 --> 01:11:50,340
and you do the same thing at many levels
of behavior,

1301
01:11:50,341 --> 01:11:55,341
especially sexually.
And you know who's going to say that 

1302
01:11:55,341 --> 01:11:56,010
there's anything wrong with that.
It's the same thing when you try to keep

1303
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:59,010
your bathroom cleaning your kitchen 
clean and the city streets clean and all

1304
01:11:59,011 --> 01:12:00,240
of that,
and you think,

1305
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:01,380
well,
that's all the good.

1306
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:02,340
It's like,
yeah,

1307
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:04,920
but look what happens when that gets out
of control,

1308
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:10,580
you know?
And that's a terrible thing in a sense 

1309
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:12,621
because it's.
It's one thing if something that's bad 

1310
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:15,090
in and of itself gets out of hand and 
then make something really bad,

1311
01:12:15,091 --> 01:12:17,730
but it's really a whole different 
category of awful.

1312
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:22,880
When something appears to be pretty much
they're only for benefit and it gets out

1313
01:12:22,891 --> 01:12:27,891
of control and it gets so horrible that 
it produces worse effects and the 

1314
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:28,590
effects that it was designed to prevent 
it.

1315
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:39,380
I want to just show you a little bit of 
a film that goes along with this.

1316
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:44,900
Oh,
there is an example of Nazi order as 

1317
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,751
well,
so that's at Nuremberg and I need to 

1318
01:12:47,751 --> 01:12:48,210
explain this picture to you.
So the Nuremberg field was massive,

1319
01:12:48,211 --> 01:12:50,400
as I said,
you see those curtains,

1320
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:55,200
those are lights and the lights are the 
search lights from the Luftwaffe,

1321
01:12:55,201 --> 01:12:57,510
uh,
which was the Nazi air force.

1322
01:12:57,511 --> 01:13:01,440
And Hitler would put those up behind him
when he was speaking.

1323
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:06,441
And so then he'd be have a curtain of 
lights behind them that stretched up so 

1324
01:13:06,441 --> 01:13:08,250
high into the sky that you couldn't see 
the top of them.

1325
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:10,690
And everybody was organized out there 
in,

1326
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:11,880
in there.
Ah,

1327
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,830
on the marching field.
See,

1328
01:13:13,831 --> 01:13:16,650
there's a good example there.
Look at those people on the left top,

1329
01:13:16,651 --> 01:13:21,510
left there.
They're organized in multiple dimensions

1330
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:26,511
simultaneously.
And then on the right you see a 

1331
01:13:26,511 --> 01:13:28,050
Nuremberg parade ground and there's 
hundreds of thousands of people there.

1332
01:13:28,051 --> 01:13:31,140
And they're all in absolutely perfect 
corridors.

1333
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,890
And these are comments from the,
from Hitler and from the Nazis.

1334
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:45,990
People,
the world will recognize the Jew as 

1335
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:47,911
world parasite.
And there will become a time when there 

1336
01:13:47,911 --> 01:13:48,400
will be one united front of all people 
against the Jewish world,

1337
01:13:48,401 --> 01:13:53,401
parasite and humanity will be freed from
the most severe illness from which he 

1338
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:55,220
suffered for thousands of years.
So,

1339
01:13:55,221 --> 01:14:00,221
and here's,
here's some quotes from Hitler from a 

1340
01:14:00,221 --> 01:14:01,480
paper called Hitler's ideology embodied 
metaphor,

1341
01:14:01,481 --> 01:14:02,590
fantasy.
In history,

1342
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:08,140
the state did not power possess the 
power to manifest the disease.

1343
01:14:08,141 --> 01:14:13,141
The menacing decay of the right was 
manifest politicians tinkering around on

1344
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:19,711
the German national body.
So most of the forms of our general 

1345
01:14:19,711 --> 01:14:23,191
disease,
but blindly ignored the virus at the 

1346
01:14:23,191 --> 01:14:26,521
time of the unification.
The inner decay was already in full 

1347
01:14:26,521 --> 01:14:28,450
swing and the general situation was 
deteriorating from year to year.

1348
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:31,300
The station did not grow inwardly 
healthier,

1349
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:36,301
but obviously languished more and more.
The symptoms of decay of the prewar 

1350
01:14:36,301 --> 01:14:37,930
period can be reduced to racial causes.

1351
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:42,580
Anyone who wants to cure this era,
which was inwardly sick and rotten,

1352
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:47,790
must first of all,
sum up the courage to make clear the 

1353
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:50,191
causes of this disease.
They think that they must demonstrate 

1354
01:14:50,191 --> 01:14:53,200
that they are ready for appeasement,
so as to stay the deadly cancerous ulcer

1355
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:58,201
through a policy of moderation.
If this battle should not come Germany 

1356
01:14:58,201 --> 01:15:01,030
with decay and at best would sync to 
ruin like a rotting corpse.

1357
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:07,380
Now you get the idea and you know,
it's so interesting to me because you 

1358
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:12,391
know,
this is a straight psychological 

1359
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:12,391
research.
Most of it psychometric you know,

1360
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:16,051
and all of a sudden out of that comes 
this finding that orderliness is linked 

1361
01:15:16,051 --> 01:15:17,950
to conservatism and it's linked to the 
behavioral immune system and Poof,

1362
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,530
you have a completely new explanation 
for what happened with the Nazis.

1363
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:27,510
So.
So that's what happens when orderliness 

1364
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:32,281
gets out of hand.
And it's interesting too because the 

1365
01:15:32,281 --> 01:15:33,060
Germans are known for their orderliness,
for their engineering prowess,

1366
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:38,210
know for the organization and 
cleanliness and freedom from corruption 

1367
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:43,081
of their political state.
And yet this is what happens when it's 

1368
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:43,540
taken to an extreme.
