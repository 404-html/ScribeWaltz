1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,490
So last time we talked a little bit 
about the state of the world of belief,

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,010
I suppose by the end of the 19th century
and I talked to you a little bit about 

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,010
Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and and 
character guard.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,820
I'm a very large number of the clinical 
theories that we're going to be 

5
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:33,921
discussing for another two lectures 
after this one have been influenced by 

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,350
philosophers.
And that's partly why I'm also talking 

7
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,081
to you about the philosophers.
It's almost as if in some sense the 

8
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:48,021
great philosophers have our tap directly
into the lower strata of our,

9
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,790
our,
our cultural systems of meaning as they 

10
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,441
move forward in time and they can 
outline what those structures are and 

11
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:05,661
also describe their weaknesses and their
strengths and their likely 

12
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:08,050
transformation moving forward.
You know,

13
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,310
I mean obviously people can be behind 
the times and just as it's just as 

14
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:19,200
probable that some people are ahead of 
the times and we would assume,

15
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,980
if you're thinking about it to say from 
a big five traits perspective,

16
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:27,000
that the people who are ahead of the 
times often are very,

17
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,010
very intelligent and very,
very open.

18
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,860
And of course that's a pretty good 
definition of a philosopher,

19
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,850
so Nietzsche and Dostoevsky,
I think more than any other two thinkers

20
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,300
had their finger on the pulse of the 
transmutation of cultural systems,

21
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:51,960
of meaning in the at the end of the 19th
century,

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,040
and they were both very concerned about 
the fact that the systems of meaning 

23
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:04,620
within which Western civilization at 
least had taken shape,

24
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,610
had been fragmented for a variety of 
reasons.

25
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,660
The most important of which was likely 
the rise of the scientific world view.

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,310
And as I detailed to you in the last 
lecture,

27
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,560
both Dostoevsky and Nisha believed that 
that had left modern people.

28
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,760
Because I think in the early 20th 
century it was Western people,

29
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:34,761
but now I think it's reasonable to say 
that it's modern people in a state of 

30
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,830
their.
Their,

31
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,110
their cultural discontinuity things,
belief systems,

32
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:49,221
but also technological systems now have 
transformed the world so radically that 

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,160
the conflict between modernism and 
traditional forms of belief is acutely 

34
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,300
felt everywhere.

35
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:04,350
It certainly,
I think one of the forces that have 

36
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,341
given rise to the battle between Islamic
fundamentalism and modernism because 

37
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:16,231
it's more of that than a battle of 
Islamic fundamentalism against the 

38
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:19,591
Western world,
and the problem fundamentally is that 

39
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,500
people typically exist within cultural 
constructs that are very,

40
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:28,501
very ancient and that have,
that are grounded in in evolved systems 

41
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:35,371
of meaning that it are even deeper than 
the ones that are articulated and 

42
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:39,100
explicit and when there's a period of 
very,

43
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:44,101
very rapid cognitive and technological 
change than the integrity of those 

44
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:49,381
systems starts to.
It starts to become questionable from an

45
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,030
explicit perspective,
but it also starts to become 

46
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,670
insufficient from a practical 
perspective.

47
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:02,671
So one example that you might give some 
consideration to is the fact of the 

48
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:06,730
introduction of the birth control pill.
For example,

49
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,150
if you listen to politically minded 
people,

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,440
they make the case that the emancipation
of women was essentially a political 

51
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:24,091
matter,
but I don't think that that's a very 

52
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:24,091
reasonable way of looking at it at all.

53
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:24,280
Of course,
the things,

54
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,460
everything feeds back onto itself and 
there are multiple causal pathways to 

55
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:35,521
any and the radical element in the 
emancipation of women was of course the 

56
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,390
development of efficient forms of 
contraception,

57
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,120
most particularly the birth control 
pill,

58
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,130
and it's the case that as soon as you 
educate women anywhere in the world,

59
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,030
not only does economic productivity rise
dramatically,

60
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:57,031
in fact,
it's actually the best predictor of 

61
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,981
increase in economic predict 
productivity in a modernizing state is 

62
00:04:58,981 --> 00:04:59,980
the granting of rights to women.
Now,

63
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:04,981
whether it's directly because of the 
granting of rights to women or because 

64
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:10,531
of the existence of an underlying belief
structure that allows the concept of 

65
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:14,450
right to expand quite rapidly.
It's very difficult to be sure of,

66
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,470
but in any case that exists,
and then of course the other thing that 

67
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,371
happens is that women stop having 
children unbelievably rapidly.

68
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,960
So for example,
I think,

69
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,440
I believe it's Iran where this has been 
most market over the last two 

70
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:37,411
generations,
so from family size is far greater than 

71
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:40,861
replacement two family sizes well below 
replacement in basically one or two 

72
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:45,481
generations.
It's a massive transformation and it's 

73
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:45,481
not necessarily something that anyone 
expected.

74
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,490
It's part of the sequence of forces that
are rapidly allowing our population to 

75
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:56,320
reach a peak and then either stabilize 
or decline.

76
00:05:56,321 --> 00:06:00,110
I don't know how many of you know this,
but the projections are that there'll be

77
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,140
9 billion people on the earth within 30 
to 50 years and that'll be our peak 

78
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,840
population after that,
it will fall rapidly and you know,

79
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:12,440
you can see that sort of thing happening
right now all over the western world and

80
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,500
it's happening a lot in China and it's 
happening in Japan where there are more 

81
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,970
older people than there are younger 
people because the younger people aren't

82
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:23,450
having enough children to actually 
replace the population.

83
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,350
So the probability that will peak at 
about $9 million and then start to fall.

84
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,890
It's not certain,
but that's what the best projections 

85
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:32,890
seemed.
Indicate now.

86
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Oh,
so what happens anyways with in periods 

87
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,890
of very rapid technological and 
cognitive transformation,

88
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:44,891
because those things go together,
that the certainties upon which people 

89
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:49,330
base their interpretation of the world 
and even more importantly base their 

90
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,300
judgments about how to act start to 
become uncertain.

91
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,210
So for example,
if you introduce the birth control pill 

92
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,481
into a population and you put women's 
reproductive faculties under their own 

93
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:09,290
voluntary choice,
then you radically transformed virtually

94
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,890
all of society's fundamental social 
structures,

95
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,830
not least marriage and marriage of 
course,

96
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:20,831
is being regarded plastically as the 
foundation of civilization and of course

97
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,240
increasingly there are more people who 
aren't married.

98
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:29,240
Then there are people who are married 
now.

99
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,680
It's very difficult to know what to make
of that because of course there's no 

100
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,221
setting the clock back and it's not even
clear that you would want to set back 

101
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:45,830
the clock if you could,
but expecting cultural constructs,

102
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,860
which takes centuries or maybe even 
thousands or maybe even tens of 

103
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,750
thousands of years to develop,
to keep up with change of that magnitude

104
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:54,170
is.

105
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,200
It's not possible.
No,

106
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,250
I mean,
and you guys face technological 

107
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,970
transformations that are earth 
shattering on an almost yearly basis and

108
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,550
you hardly even notice it.
I mean,

109
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,900
tinder is a good example of that.
You know,

110
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:13,901
I don't know if you know,
but tinder is produced quite a spike in 

111
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:14,110
sexually transmitted diseases,
but you know,

112
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,180
it's a radical technology because it's 
the first technology that's ever been 

113
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,751
invented that enables men to find 
partners with no fear,

114
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,570
with virtually no fear of rejection.
And of course that's been a limiting 

115
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,471
factor for.
That's been a defining feature of the 

116
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,860
interactions between men and women ever 
since history began.

117
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,580
And so these things are occurring at,
at an extraordinary rate and of course 

118
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,620
it's not reasonable to expect are more 
slower moving cultural constructs to 

119
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:52,451
keep up with them.
And that's partly because as well that 

120
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:52,451
you know,
people talk for example,

121
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:54,140
about the divisive nature of religion.

122
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,770
You often hear people who are critics of
formal religion in particular talk about

123
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:03,771
the fact that religion,
underwire underlies a tremendous amount 

124
00:09:03,771 --> 00:09:05,220
of destruction and warfare and conflict.
And you know,

125
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,770
first of all,
it isn't religion that does that.

126
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:12,771
By the way,
it's tribalism and tribalism 

127
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:15,040
characterizes even chimpanzees and I 
don't think chimpanzees go to war with 

128
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,690
each other for religious reasons.
So you know,

129
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,700
the religious groupings of mankind are 
our large scale manifestations of the 

130
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:27,831
same phenomena that produce dominance 
hierarchies in the wild and of course 

131
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:32,220
large scale religions unite people 
within the religion just as much as they

132
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:36,750
divide people on the outside of it.
So part of the accumulation of religious

133
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:41,100
tradition across time is a process that 
allows thousands and 10,

134
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:46,101
thousands and even millions of people to
exist within the same hierarchy of 

135
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:49,650
values and exist relatively peacefully.
As a consequence.

136
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,890
Now I'm saying relatively peacefully,
you know,

137
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,420
a hundred years ago it was thought that 
pre,

138
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,030
let's say,
let's say archaic people.

139
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:05,031
So those would be people who are still 
living a fairly isolated tribal life in 

140
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:05,310
small groups,
pre,

141
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,560
you know,
basically operating at the level of 

142
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,501
stone age technology.
Let's say the idea was there was a very 

143
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:14,250
popular idea for a long time that those 
cultures were,

144
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,910
um,
communistic and violence free.

145
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,940
And that's wrong.
They're not violence for you at all.

146
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:23,250
If you track the homicide rates in stone
age,

147
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:28,251
culture is there way,
way higher than they are in civilized 

148
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:28,830
cultures like orders of magnitude 
higher.

149
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,350
And there's a variety of reasons for 
that,

150
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:36,351
but I'm just telling you that because 
you want to dispense with the idea that 

151
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:41,060
along with complex civilizations and 
this friend say of unifying religious 

152
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,140
beliefs,
there was an increase,

153
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,290
an increase in baseline violence because
there's just no evidence for that at 

154
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:47,290
all.

155
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,980
Now,
the problem with these large scale 

156
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,260
belief systems is they're not very fast.
And part of the reason for that is that 

157
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,370
in order for a large scale belief system
and to,

158
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,790
to,
to,

159
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,490
uh,
manifest itself in any reasonable forum,

160
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:07,491
it has to be predicated on the mutual 
agreement of the people within whom 

161
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,530
within,
who operate within its embrace.

162
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,700
You know?
So for,

163
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,810
for Toronto to exist as a city,
as a peaceful city,

164
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:23,811
basically what has to happen is that the
vast majority of us have to agree that 

165
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:29,151
the rules that govern the city and the 
social interactions within the city are 

166
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,290
useful.
And just.

167
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,440
And because if you don't agree with 
that,

168
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:39,441
then splinter movements of all starts 
start to occur and people become more 

169
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:44,031
revolutionary in their modes of action 
and then they become more violent and 

170
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:44,250
the whole system starts to break down.

171
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,250
So it's not easy to establish a 
collective norm because people have to 

172
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:55,851
agree to it.
And you can imagine that hammering out 

173
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:57,940
agreement with anything,
with even a small agreement that affects

174
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:02,941
many,
many people is a process that takes a 

175
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,461
tremendous amount of time.
People can argue forever about the 

176
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,750
smallest alterations in the systems that
regulate our behavior.

177
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,290
Now,
you know,

178
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,240
some of you might be familiar with the 
terror management theories.

179
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,520
How many of you have heard of terror 
management theory?

180
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,080
Okay,
well,

181
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,440
the terror management theories that are 
predicated on the idea that our belief 

182
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
systems protect us from our fear of 
death.

183
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,070
Now exactly how they do that isn't 
specified particularly well in the 

184
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,550
terror management theories.
But the originator of the theory,

185
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:35,551
whose name was Ernest Becker,
who was a sociologist by the way and 

186
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:35,551
afraid,
Ian,

187
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,610
um,
believed that cultural systems enabled 

188
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:46,111
us to attribute beliefs to our actions,
finite and infinite,

189
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:49,870
so that we could consider ourselves in 
relationship to mortality.

190
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,870
And in some sense,
hide from the truth of the attitude of 

191
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,870
our existence.
Now,

192
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,740
one of the things that terror management
theorists don't really give any credence

193
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:04,741
to is the fact that belief systems are 
not only systems of belief systems of 

194
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,540
action regulation,
right?

195
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,260
So we've talked about the pig Eddie and 
notion of a game.

196
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:17,070
The game exists first as something that 
everyone can play and only later as 

197
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:21,430
something that people represent and a 
social cultures the same way,

198
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,640
a cultural,
a culture regulates the way that you 

199
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,671
interact with each other and what you 
expect from each other and how you can 

200
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:33,691
fulfill your mutual,
your needs in relationship to one 

201
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:36,931
another.
And then it's represented and the 

202
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,440
representation might help you find 
meaning in your life.

203
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:41,320
But the fact of the initial social 
contract,

204
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,710
which is the phenomena that regulates 
your interpersonal behavior,

205
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,120
doesn't protect you from the fear of 
death that protects you from dying.

206
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,830
And,
and that's a very important thing to 

207
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:54,830
note.
I mean,

208
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:54,830
you know,
all of you know,

209
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,180
of course it's very cold out today and 
yet here you are in this classroom where

210
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:00,990
it's Renault ridiculously comfortable,
you know,

211
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:06,810
by classroom standards and of course by 
standards around the world and you're 

212
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,400
not freezing to death in here.
And that's not your belief.

213
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,930
It's protecting you.
It's the fact that you're embedded in 

214
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,110
this insanely complicated system of 
cultural interactions.

215
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:20,530
And it just so happens that you get to 
sit here and listen to a lecture.

216
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Well,
there's thousands of people being 

217
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:25,800
around.
Many of them outside in the cold,

218
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,430
making sure that the power grid,
for example,

219
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,550
that keeps this place warm,
is property maintained and functional,

220
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:34,910
which takes a tremendous amount of work.
So when in,

221
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,940
during periods of rapid transformation,
it's hard for the social contract to 

222
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,311
adjust itself so that everyone knows how
to behave in relationship to one 

223
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:44,311
another.

224
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:46,450
But then it's also very difficult for 
the description of that.

225
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:49,930
So the articulated norms that constitute
a society,

226
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,170
it's very difficult for them to 
transform rapidly enough so that they 

227
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,081
can keep track of the,
of the changes and and help people 

228
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:03,041
decide what they should do.
So let me give you an example.

229
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:08,291
So I had a client Hawaiian back who had 
been raised as the fundamentalist 

230
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:13,181
Christian and she was very.
She had been socialized and had come to 

231
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:18,740
believe that sex before marriage was 
wrong,

232
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:23,741
but the probability that she was going 
to get married before she was 27 or 28 

233
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,310
was low for a whole variety of reasons.
And so then she faced this conundrum and

234
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:32,180
it was an interesting conundrum from my 
perspective because you know,

235
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,630
I think that in a well regulated psyche,
sexuality is integrated into the 

236
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:42,950
personality so that it's so that it 
plays its role in the,

237
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,720
what would you call in the quality of 
the self.

238
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,330
It's integrated properly inside.
And so it's under moral control,

239
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,200
roughly speaking because it serves its 
own function,

240
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:59,201
plus the function of,
of keeping the person well situated in 

241
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:03,581
the present and developing property in 
the future and maintaining proper 

242
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:07,481
relationships with everyone around them.
But it was quite obvious to me that a 

243
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:12,011
lot of the constraints that had been 
placed on her behavior as a consequence 

244
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:15,821
of her relatively rigid belief,
we're actually interfering with her 

245
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:15,980
development as a person,
you know.

246
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:18,080
And so one of the things we had to 
puzzle out was,

247
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:23,081
well,
exactly what are the moral guidelines 

248
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:26,390
that you should use to regulate your 
sexual behavior outside of marriage?

249
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:28,460
If you're not planning to be married 
for,

250
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,350
you know,
maybe until your late twenties.

251
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,370
Well,
you know,

252
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,340
good luck trying to figure that out.
Like it's a really.

253
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,720
It's a really,
really,

254
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:37,610
really,
really complicated question.

255
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,730
And it's certainly not obvious that any 
one person can figure out the answer to 

256
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,170
that in a single lifetime.
You know,

257
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,150
even if they thought,
if nothing else,

258
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,480
especially because the landscape itself 
is transforming as you're attempting to 

259
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,120
adjust to it.
You know,

260
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:58,121
when we eventually concluded,
although it was a very individual 

261
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:02,471
solution,
we eventually concluded that there were 

262
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:02,471
things that she had forbidden herself to
do,

263
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:07,271
that we're stopping her from 
establishing any kind of longterm 

264
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:09,290
relationship at all and that that was 
interfering with her development,

265
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,800
you know,
as a mature person and that the morality

266
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:17,801
that she had used to structured her 
behavior appeared to be 

267
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:17,801
counterproductive.
At least,

268
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:18,170
you know,
in some,

269
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,710
in some areas.
So it's one thing to,

270
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:22,970
you know,
to,

271
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,780
to regulate sexuality in the hopes of 
marriage when you get married when 

272
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,591
you're 19 or 20 or 21,
it's a completely different thing when 

273
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:33,860
it's perhaps not going to happen until 
you're in your late twenties.

274
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,700
So now need shit talked a lot and 
Dostoevsky talked a lot about the 

275
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:45,020
collapse of meaning systems in the late 
19th century.

276
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:47,740
And you know,
that was followed by a very,

277
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,750
very rapid period.
Technological transformation like that 

278
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:52,980
really kicked in in the late 18 
hundreds,

279
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:53,850
which was the,
you know,

280
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,330
the.
Well was it the height of the industrial

281
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,070
revolution,
particularly in England.

282
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:04,071
And there were modern technologies being
thrust out of the industrial revolution,

283
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:06,750
like mad,
like the automobile in the airplane,

284
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:11,220
in the electric light and recording 
devices and all of the things that we're

285
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,730
still elaborating on now.
And then of course,

286
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,070
apart from the collapse of classic,
Say Christian belief and the 

287
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,940
introduction of all these new 
technologies.

288
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:28,941
When World War One hit the entire 
monarchical structure of the Western 

289
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:33,111
world collapsed.
And that also occurred say with regards 

290
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:35,841
to the Ottoman Empire.
And that was partly what led to the 

291
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,230
creation of the modern Middle East.
And of course we're still,

292
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,710
that still hasn't been sorted out to any
great degree at all.

293
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,150
So the monarchical structures collapsed.
These ancient civilizations,

294
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,780
Russians underwent their revolution and 
we're,

295
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,120
you know,
and were transformed into communists.

296
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:56,121
And then after World War One,
the stress between the potential 

297
00:18:57,781 --> 00:19:02,781
different ways of structuring societies 
after the monarchical societies had 

298
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:04,560
collapsed,
was almost unbearable.

299
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,020
And people didn't really know what to 
do.

300
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:07,770
No.

301
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:08,880
Okay.

302
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,510
What happened at,
at the end of niches,

303
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,530
period and Dostoyevsky's period?
Was that the question that both of those

304
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:16,980
people,

305
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,730
what?
No

306
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:26,170
most important question.
Both of those people asked became the 

307
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,341
central focus of the development of 
philosophical ideas of ethics in the 

308
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:30,850
20th century,
so you could think about those.

309
00:19:30,851 --> 00:19:33,460
Is that as a kind of a post religious 
ethic?

310
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Now the reason I'm telling you this is 
because among other things is because a 

311
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,801
lot of what cycle analytic or 
psychotherapeutic treatment is about is 

312
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:49,840
about ethics and that can't be stressed 
too much because ethics is about how you

313
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:54,841
see the world and how you behave and so 
even behaviorists who are technically 

314
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,210
embedded in the scientific world are 
still pregnant,

315
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,320
practical emphasis because what they're 
consistently doing with their clients is

316
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:08,290
breaking down whatever the problems are 
that are causing the misery,

317
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,770
breaking them down into sub problems and
trying to figure out solutions that 

318
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,620
improve their quality of life,
like practical,

319
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:17,740
implementable solutions that improve 
their quality of life.

320
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:20,770
Not only now,
but as they propagate into the future.

321
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:24,490
And that is not a scientific issue.
It's a how to live issue.

322
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,390
So the entire history of the 20th 
century,

323
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:29,650
in some sense,
political,

324
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:34,651
economic,
and psychological was a sequence of 

325
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,900
attempts to answer the question when 
your fundamental systems of ethics 

326
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,610
collapse.
How is it that you should live

327
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,540
now?
Nisha said very clearly that there would

328
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,440
be two to the collapse of these systems 
and one would be nihilism.

329
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,920
The belief that nothing at all,
which he also regarded as a form of 

330
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,911
escape from responsibility.
So it's a logical consequence of the 

331
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:03,841
breakdown of classical belief systems,
but it's also a a cop out and it's the 

332
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:08,410
kind of cop out the Dostoevsky explored 
very deeply in his small,

333
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,090
brilliant novel notes from underground 
which describes a person who's basically

334
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,270
slipped an intelligent person and an 
irresponsible person who's basically 

335
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,501
slipped into a pit of meaninglessness 
where he experienced his hatred and 

336
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:27,511
resentment and the desire for revenge 
and all of the sorts of things that 

337
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:31,291
would afflict someone in the underworld 
who's got nothing to hold them together.

338
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,910
And then of course you also talked about
the likelihood that people would turn to

339
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,950
totalitarian belief systems such as.

340
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,960
And he particularly discussed communism 
as a replacement for religious belief.

341
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,780
I can give you a Canadian example of 
that.

342
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:51,781
So I heard a Gallup pollster one time,
I was at a conference in Ottawa.

343
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,810
So the only time I've ever heard this,
and I think it's an amazing.

344
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,410
It's an amazing fact.
They were looking at the probability 

345
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,521
that people would be separatist in 
Quebec and if you are a lapsed Catholic,

346
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:10,540
the probability that you will be a 
separate as was increased 10 times.

347
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,830
And the reason for that is,
you know,

348
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,420
Catholicism fell apart in Quebec in the 
late 19 fifties.

349
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:20,260
It was one of the last places in the 
Western world,

350
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:22,510
roughly speaking,
where the,

351
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,680
the feudal in some sense structures of 
Catholicism had maintained themselves 

352
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:31,210
right up to that point,
right up until the 19 fifties,

353
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,850
late 19 fifties.
And that collapsed precipitously low,

354
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,810
just like belief in Christianity had in 
Russia,

355
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:38,920
you know,
in the late,

356
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,180
say 18 eighties.

357
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,970
And what happened in Quebec was,
well first of all,

358
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:44,590
the birth rate plummeted.
I mean,

359
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,770
I did genetic research in Quebec and in 
the 19 fifties and before that it was 

360
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,600
very typical to see families of nine to 
13 children.

361
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,810
And of course now rebecca has the lowest
birth rate.

362
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:58,390
I believe in the Western world.
It's way below replacement.

363
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:00,940
Everybody bailed out of the church.
Nobody gets married.

364
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,390
And if you were a separate as if you 
were a lapsed Catholic,

365
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,640
you are 10 times more likely to be a 
separatist.

366
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,970
All that meant was that with Catholicism
fell apart,

367
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,590
you know,
people who still needed to have very 

368
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,230
structured belief systems just turned to
nationalism as a natural alternative,

369
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,710
you know,
and that's part of what,

370
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,560
that's part of what accounted for the,
the rigidity and utopian,

371
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,990
uh,
the utopia and utopia nature of the 

372
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,660
Quebec movement towards independence.

373
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:36,970
You know,
I remember talking to one of my 

374
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,480
colleagues are very,
very intelligent person and uh,

375
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,900
you know,
I asked him because at that point they 

376
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,240
were predicting that if Quebec 
separated,

377
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:45,770
the Canadian dollar would fall to forty 
cents,

378
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:50,771
forty five cents.
US something like that and be complete 

379
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:50,771
economic catastrophe.
I said,

380
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:50,771
well,
you know,

381
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:55,631
the,
the predictions are that if Canada 

382
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:58,001
separates and first of all or Quebec 
separates and no one would know how to 

383
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,120
do that as the Canadian economy will 
collapse,

384
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,670
and of course that'll collapse the 
Quebec economy too.

385
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,190
And he didn't deny that.
He said,

386
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:05,540
yeah,
but it would be worth it.

387
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,100
And I thought,
well,

388
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:12,101
there's just no way of having a 
conversation and under those 

389
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:12,101
circumstances,
because from my perspective,

390
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:13,160
total,
you know,

391
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,850
severe economic collapse is a good 
reason not to do something,

392
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,180
but if you believe that the pope of 
future potential is such that that's 

393
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,230
justified,
then well,

394
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,340
there's no arguing with you.

395
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,280
It's just something that you decided.
And that's the end of that.

396
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,980
And when I lived in Quebec,
as I did for a long time,

397
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:35,981
I learned very quickly never have a 
discussion about politics with anyone 

398
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:38,300
who was a separatist because it was just
absolutely counterproductive.

399
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,600
You know,
they had axioms of belief that were 

400
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,020
movable.
The future will be good enough so that 

401
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,020
no matter what price we pay in the 
present,

402
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,440
that will be justified.
It's like,

403
00:24:48,441 --> 00:24:49,640
well,
that's not an idea,

404
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:54,670
right?
It's a statement of faith and you saw 

405
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,420
exactly the same thing happening,
not with the same principles.

406
00:24:56,421 --> 00:25:01,421
I'm not saying that,
but you saw the same thing happening 

407
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:02,600
from a psychological perspective in 
Russia when the Communists,

408
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:07,601
you know,
when the communists really started to 

409
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:09,101
become active in the 19 twenties when 
any matter of horror whatsoever was 

410
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:13,721
fully justifiable because it was going 
to bring about some future state that 

411
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,170
was basically equivalent to paradise.

412
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,220
So anyways,
so and then you know,

413
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:24,221
Dostoevsky pursued the idea of nihilism 
even farther because Dostoevsky was 

414
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:29,591
certainly someone who is willing to go 
to the ends of an argument and one of 

415
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:33,221
the things he proclaimed was that if 
there was no god than anything was 

416
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:37,481
permitted and his basic hypothesis was 
well as if there is no all ultimate 

417
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,520
arbiter of values.
If there's no transcendent arbiter of 

418
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,990
values,
then you're radically free.

419
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,270
Now the existentialists would say,
well,

420
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:50,420
you could use that radical freedom to 
find meaning in your life,

421
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,750
but one of the things Dostoevsky 
realized was that you could use that 

422
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,480
radical freedom for anything that you 
wanted.

423
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,640
And so in his book,
crime and punishment,

424
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:03,110
for example,
he explores the actions and beliefs of a

425
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:08,111
student named rascal in the cog and 
rescheduled the call is a starving 

426
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:12,521
student.
He's a law student and he doesn't have 

427
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:12,521
enough to eat.

428
00:26:12,521 --> 00:26:15,580
So of course he's his cognition is a 
little bit on the adult side because 

429
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,450
he's going through periods of starvation
and drunkenness,

430
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:21,080
so it's not like he's thinking that 
clearly he wants to become a law student

431
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:25,790
so that it can help society and he finds
out that his sister is basically willing

432
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:30,791
to enter into a loveless marriage and 
more or less prostituted herself so that

433
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:36,101
she can generate enough money to share 
with her mother so that they can fund 

434
00:26:36,101 --> 00:26:40,661
his continuation through law school and 
he thinks that wouldn't be a very good 

435
00:26:40,661 --> 00:26:41,780
deal.
At the same time,

436
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:45,990
he's indebted a pawn broker who everyone
hates,

437
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:49,650
who is an absolutely miserable person in
every possible way.

438
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,930
Dostoevsky sets up the situation like 
that.

439
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:55,440
So the pawn broker has a nice,
if I remember correctly,

440
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:57,520
who she basically enslaved and 
mistreated,

441
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,910
and she squirrels,
squirrels away,

442
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:02,130
all sorts of money,
but never does anything with it,

443
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:07,131
lives in absolute poverty and anyways,
he considers her the sort of person 

444
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,930
without whom the world would be a better
place.

445
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,130
So having all of these things co 
occurring in his imagination,

446
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,160
he decides that because there are no 
ultimate arbiter of value,

447
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,810
that all morality is essentially 
cowardice,

448
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,700
which is kind of the reverse of what 
nature concluded.

449
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,140
See,
said most people were cowardly and 

450
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,301
justified that with their morality,
but responding to calls took the other 

451
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:33,301
idea,
which is,

452
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:35,640
well,
why do I have to obey any rules at all?

453
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,610
If there's no ultimate source for any of
these rules?

454
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,570
It's just convention and cowardice.
And,

455
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:46,730
and if I have enough strength,
then I can leave outside of that 

456
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,380
framework and I can do whatever I want.
So he decides to kill the,

457
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,140
the pawnbroker,
which he does and quite successfully.

458
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:57,141
And not only that,
he gets away with it and that's about 

459
00:27:57,141 --> 00:28:00,141
the first third of crime and punishment.
And the rest of the book is the 

460
00:28:00,141 --> 00:28:04,050
discussion of the manner in which he 
comes unglued as a consequence of having

461
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,190
performed this act.

462
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,990
And it's,
it's brilliant.

463
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:12,170
It's absolutely brilliant study of the 
way that a value system holds you 

464
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:16,290
together even in ways that you don't 
know.

465
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,920
And then if you step outside of that 
and,

466
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,100
and violate your relationship to it in 
some really intense way,

467
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:28,370
then there's going to be catastrophic 
psychological consequences that will 

468
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,070
echo through your whole being.
You know,

469
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:34,230
we know that this is more than theory 
because many people,

470
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:37,740
soldiers in particular who develop 
posttraumatic stress disorder,

471
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:43,070
develop posttraumatic stress disorder 
when they observe themselves doing 

472
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,211
something that they regard as 
tremendously cruel or vicious or 

473
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:47,730
immoral.
You know,

474
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,520
when they're in the situation where,
you know,

475
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,680
uh,
acting that acting in that manner is 

476
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,611
highly probable.
It's a war situation usually very 

477
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:58,611
intense.
And you know,

478
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,180
they don't have a lot of time to make 
decisions.

479
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:05,160
And God only knows what the specifics 
are of the particular event.

480
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,490
But many,
many people come to be so shattered by 

481
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:15,111
observing themselves do things they 
can't believe that a human being would 

482
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:16,260
be capable of doing that they never 
recovered,

483
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,980
and it's partly because you know they 
violate their,

484
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:25,370
their ethical,
the ethical structure that holds them 

485
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,941
together,
holds older ideas and their plans and 

486
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,750
their perceptions and their interactions
with other people.

487
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:35,340
That's a unified field in some sense,
and if you violate it and it fragments,

488
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:38,080
then you're left absolutely fragmented.
Then that's,

489
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,130
that's not,
that's not even a psychological 

490
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:43,810
observation.
It's a psychophysiological observation.

491
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:48,811
You can stress yourself so badly,
raise your stress level so high that 

492
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:52,600
your brain starts to become damaged by 
the stress hormones and you know,

493
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:55,930
so it's.
It's not just a psychological state,

494
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,950
it's,
it's damaged to the core of your being 

495
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,811
in some sense.
Now the collapse of these belief systems

496
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:10,450
and their destabilization was well 
thought through by these thinkers by the

497
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:11,740
end of the 19th century.

498
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,740
And then we have the technological 
transformations and the and the 

499
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,110
sociological and political 
transformations of the early part of the

500
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:25,111
20th century.
That leaves everyone in a state of 

501
00:30:25,111 --> 00:30:27,250
confusion in some sense,
like in Germany in the 19 twenties,

502
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:32,251
of course,
the Germans had gone through this 

503
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:33,220
terrible period of trench warfare,
so they're all there.

504
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:38,221
Men were brutalized.
Some of them had been on the front for 

505
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:38,290
months and that was in the trenches and 
then you know,

506
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:40,780
their political system had collapsed and
they'd put a week,

507
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,020
weekly rooted democracy in place and 
then the economic system collapsed in 

508
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,960
Germany,
went through a period of hyperinflation.

509
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:51,961
So that money,
the value of their money basically 

510
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:55,291
dropped to zero.
And so that meant that if he were 65 

511
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:59,281
years old and had saved up your whole 
life to have enough money to retire and 

512
00:30:59,281 --> 00:30:59,650
we're a good citizen,
you know,

513
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,060
and,
and prudent and careful.

514
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,570
Every single thing you ever own 
disappeared.

515
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,450
And so at the same time,
you know,

516
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,690
the communist revolution had taken place
in Soviet Russia and there was great 

517
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,250
concern within Germany that the same 
thing was likely to happen there.

518
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:20,251
And certainly the,
the communists were always pushing for 

519
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:24,091
that because they had the common term 
which is the international communist 

520
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,960
movement,
which was devoted towards destabilizing,

521
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,510
you know,
non communist governments and,

522
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,480
and producing the preconditions for the 
revolution.

523
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:36,481
So it wasn't,
wasn't like it was just paranoia was a 

524
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:36,850
real threat and it was out of all that 
mess that came,

525
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,250
the emergence of the fascists and the 
Nazis.

526
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:40,810
And it's not that,
you know,

527
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,880
it's,
it's not that surprising because chaos 

528
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,490
breeds the desire for order.
And so that was what,

529
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,410
that was one direction that people could
go,

530
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:55,411
you know,
instead of following an abstract 

531
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:57,540
Messiah,
let's say this sort of idea that was 

532
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,781
embedded in classical Christianity,
they realized the new Messiah not was 

533
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:00,970
Hitler.

534
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:06,270
And that certainly didn't seem to be any
improvement because Hitler was really a 

535
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,050
messiah,
destruction and fire.

536
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:13,470
And you know,
the World War Two killed about $120 

537
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,591
million people.
And of course it left Germany in 

538
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:18,631
absolute ruins.
And Hitler killed himself in his bunker 

539
00:32:18,631 --> 00:32:21,841
underneath Berlin while it was burning.
And the Russians were advancing into 

540
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:21,841
the,
you know,

541
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:23,080
into Germany.
And they were not happy.

542
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,560
You didn't want to be a German national.
Well,

543
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:28,960
the Soviets were advancing towards you 
after your,

544
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:34,290
after your country to invaded.
There's pushed them back halfway across 

545
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:34,600
the Soviet Union,
you know,

546
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:37,290
and produced a tremendous amount of 
damage and,

547
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,160
and distress.
It was an awful situation,

548
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,670
you know,
and uh,

549
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,200
the Messiah is that the,
that the Russians turned to Lenin and 

550
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,410
Stalin were barbaric and brutal beyond 
comprehension.

551
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:51,990
You know,
and it's,

552
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:54,140
it's a strange thing,
you know,

553
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:57,020
we're not very well educated in what 
happened in this,

554
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,510
in the Soviet Union in the 20th century.

555
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:04,510
We know far more about what happened in 
Germany say with the Holocaust and you 

556
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,700
know,
it's very important that people should 

557
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,391
know about that.
But there were tens of millions of 

558
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:10,850
people brutally destroyed in the Soviet 
Union.

559
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:15,851
And you know,
partly because they were murdered by 

560
00:33:15,851 --> 00:33:17,780
people who were,
at least in principle,

561
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:22,670
motivated by left wing Utopian visions.
We seem to.

562
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:27,110
Our education system seems to regard 
that as somehow more forgivable,

563
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,550
which it certainly isn't.
So you know,

564
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:36,551
the whole,
the whole generate secular alternatives 

565
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:38,240
to religious belief issue didn't seem to
work out very well.

566
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:43,180
And then the nihilism alternative.
Well that has its own problems.

567
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,090
One problem is the sort of Dostoevsky 
talked about,

568
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,120
you know,
when you see the kids who go up and 

569
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,431
shoot,
shoot up high schools and exploded in 

570
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:54,460
rage,
you know,

571
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,470
they're often people who feel that they 
have no meaning in their life,

572
00:33:57,471 --> 00:34:02,471
that life itself is contemptible and 
that suffering is too extreme and that 

573
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:02,471
they're,
they're,

574
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:07,230
they're,
they bear the brunt of unfair reality 

575
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,620
and you know,
they develop unbelievably dark and,

576
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:14,830
and destructive theories of,
of revenge and mayhem over sometimes 

577
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,250
over the period of years.

578
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:21,250
And then they go up in the world and lay
those things out and it's not like 

579
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,950
they're thinking is irrational know it's
coherent.

580
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,250
It's just predicated on principles that 
you might not agree with such as the 

581
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,060
principle that everyone that I don't 
like deserves to die.

582
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,740
But you know,
in the absence of a really formal way of

583
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,990
demonstrating that such thoughts are not
only immoral but wrong.

584
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,580
You know,
in some absolute sense.

585
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:47,810
It's very difficult to come up with ways
of defending ourselves against those two

586
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:51,110
extremes,
the extremes of destructive vitalism and

587
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:55,310
the extremes of ideological possession.
Now,

588
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:01,210
nature started to work out some some 
solutions to this and I just started to 

589
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,470
touch on those at the end of the last 
lecture,

590
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:11,180
you know,
Dostoevsky solution was a return to 

591
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,470
Christianity fundamentally,
and it's revivification and that was the

592
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:17,471
same tack that Alexander Soldier Nixon 
attempted to lay out and also tolstoy in

593
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:19,220
Russia.

594
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,560
You know,
and I'll talk to you about that a little

595
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:26,561
bit more in the next lecture,
dusty or niches idea was that people 

596
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:26,780
would have to.
He said,

597
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:28,610
you know,
when his quote about the death of God,

598
00:35:28,611 --> 00:35:33,611
that people would have to become light,
God's just to be able to tolerate the 

599
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,390
consequences of this dismemberment,
of the previous civilization.

600
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:42,510
And he believed,
well,

601
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,230
his thinking on this,
I would say is somewhat fragmentary.

602
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:51,231
I mean,
nature was a great critic of 

603
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:54,081
Christianity,
institutionalized Christianity and a 

604
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:55,830
great diagnostician.
He could say what was rotten at the core

605
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:59,520
of western civilization will say modern 
civilization,

606
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,960
but when it came to actually describing 
what to do about it,

607
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,180
well,
he didn't live that long.

608
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:07,680
You know,
he died a fairly young man.

609
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:11,520
There's actually a video of meets you in
the mental hospital online.

610
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:12,690
I just found it the other night.

611
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,540
I have no idea that he was ever captured
on video,

612
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:20,541
but there's video from a movie from a 
1899 showing him in the mental hospital 

613
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:25,821
where he ended up in his early forties.
So he talked about the development of 

614
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:28,260
the,
of the being.

615
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:33,261
He called the overmanned,
which is often translated as superman 

616
00:36:33,261 --> 00:36:37,581
and his idea was that people would have 
to take onto themselves the the burden 

617
00:36:39,061 --> 00:36:44,061
of creating new systems of meaning and 
new morality's that were suited to them 

618
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,950
that they would have to create new 
values.

619
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,980
Now,
young took niches,

620
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,470
diagnosis very,
very seriously and you can.

621
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,640
You can certainly say that young was as 
much influenced by niche as he was by 

622
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,481
Freud.
And I would say in some ways he was 

623
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:07,620
influenced more because one of the 
things that yoga was trying to do was to

624
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,980
identify where the last values had gone.

625
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:16,010
So the Nietzschean idea is that it's 
possible for human beings to create 

626
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:21,390
their own values.
Now there's a problem with that.

627
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,750
There's a variety of problems with that.
And one is that it's,

628
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:29,790
it doesn't seem exactly true in that,
you know,

629
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:34,791
and,
and a lot of the existentialists who 

630
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:34,791
followed each other,
like John Paul Sartre,

631
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:36,390
for example,
believed in the radical freedom of human

632
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:40,830
beings that we were,
we were doomed to be free in a sense.

633
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:45,831
And that was absolutely necessary for us
to conjure up our own meanings and 

634
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:49,180
values because fundamentally we faced 
the void and you know,

635
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,220
life was nasty,
brutish and short to use hobbs terms.

636
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:57,240
And that we had to be able to confront 
that and live despite it.

637
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,080
And well,
there's a variety of problems with that 

638
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,080
solution.
The first one is,

639
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,910
well,
if you come up with your system of 

640
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,910
values,
there's no reason.

641
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,780
And I come up with mine,
there's no reason to assume that they're

642
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:14,781
going to be sufficiently integratable so
that we don't have to fight each other 

643
00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:15,930
to the death.
That's a big problem.

644
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:20,931
So you know,
you'd have every single person with 

645
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:20,931
their own system of beliefs.
Well,

646
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,710
fine extent.
How do you know that?

647
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:26,010
In a sense that's a structured kind of 
philosophical anarchy.

648
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,690
Well,
okay,

649
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,270
maybe that's good if you have to live 
alone on an island,

650
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:32,580
but if you're stuck with all these other
people,

651
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:34,920
then that becomes a very difficult thing
to.

652
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,790
And I think it's partly for that reason 
that Sartre famously said,

653
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,420
hell is other people,
you know,

654
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:47,430
because he thought of the other in some 
sense that which was not him as an 

655
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:51,830
oppressive forest that stopped him from 
manifesting his destiny in the way that 

656
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,660
would have been best for him.

657
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,790
Well,
you know,

658
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,790
hell might be other people,
but that doesn't mean that,

659
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,870
first of all,
that's a very one sided way of looking 

660
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,840
at things because of course,
how it is other people hell is you too.

661
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:09,841
When you know hell is nature.
There's lots of places you could find 

662
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:10,390
hail,
but by the same token,

663
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,780
you know,
the most meaningful elements of people's

664
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:18,781
lives are often their social 
relationships and you can't lay 

665
00:39:18,781 --> 00:39:19,990
everything at the door of pathological 
society,

666
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:25,410
you know,
and we shouldn't forget as well that 

667
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:25,410
Sartre didn't,
uh,

668
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:30,180
what come up with any reasonable 
critique of the communists until the 

669
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,270
late 19 sixties,
but,

670
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:32,760
you know,
but that was a little late.

671
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,800
People with any sense like George Orwell
had figured out that the whole Soviet 

672
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,340
experiment had become radically 
murderous by the early 19 forties.

673
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:47,530
And so starcher proposed radical freedom
as a,

674
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:52,830
as a,
as the existential response to the 

675
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,100
unveiling of no meaning.

676
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,180
But when it came right down to it,
he couldn't resist identification with a

677
00:39:58,181 --> 00:40:03,181
totalitarian structure.
So I don't see any reason why we should 

678
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:03,430
really pay any attention to what he had 
to say.

679
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,980
So now there's another problem with the 
idea that people should create their own

680
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:10,480
values.
And that is the,

681
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,060
it's not so simple,
you know,

682
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,810
and the problem seems to be is that you 
don't obey yourself very well.

683
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,310
You know,
you can say,

684
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:19,930
well,
here's my code.

685
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:24,931
I'm going to live by it,
so we let's do that simply to begin 

686
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:24,931
with.
You say,

687
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:27,700
well,
I'm going to study very hard and do well

688
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:29,980
at my classes just for the sake of 
argument,

689
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,280
you know,
but you don't know.

690
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:37,290
You procrastinate and you have a paper 
you're supposed to read and you know 

691
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,621
you're supposed to read it and you need 
to read it for reasons that are even 

692
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:44,131
hypothetically important to you,
but there's no damn way you can get 

693
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:44,131
yourself to sit down and read it.

694
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:48,400
Your attention wanders and you go to do 
three or four stupid things and you feel

695
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:53,401
terrible about it.
Like you feel like you're betraying 

696
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:54,070
yourself and maybe this is a continual 
pattern in your life,

697
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:59,100
but one of the things you find out is 
that you don't get to create your own 

698
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,570
damn values because for some reason 
you're not in charge of yourself.

699
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,140
And of course that's where the 
psychoanalytic ideas start to come from.

700
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:06,460
You know,
Freud notices.

701
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,520
This is in the aftermath of nature,
that you're not the master of your own 

702
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,460
psyche.
You know that there's,

703
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,640
there's many sub use inside of you and 
they don't all want the same thing and 

704
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:22,270
so the idea that you can generate your 
own meaning is very,

705
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:27,580
it's,
it's insufficiently developed idea 

706
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,840
because there's a lot of meaning making 
generators residing within you and not 

707
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,630
only do they not all point in the same 
direction,

708
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:39,260
which is a huge problem,
but they don't even necessarily.

709
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:44,320
They don't necessarily lay themselves 
out in some integrated fashion across 

710
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,440
time and they don't necessarily operate 
together in a way that's going to enable

711
00:41:48,441 --> 00:41:51,410
you to find your place with other people
and in society.

712
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,370
So you know,
make your own meaning well,

713
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,720
which part of you,
you know,

714
00:41:56,721 --> 00:42:00,020
you're not a unified thing,
so that's a big problem.

715
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,950
And then all these other problems just 
remain unaddressed completely.

716
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,960
Well,
one answer to that,

717
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:10,640
and this is the answer that the more 
radical existentialists took as well.

718
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:13,460
Society has to be reconfigured,
but you know,

719
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:18,510
we kind of know where that leads to when
people are doing radical societal 

720
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,841
reconfiguration,
at least as far as we've been able to 

721
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:25,541
tell most of the time.
That's an absolute murderous 

722
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,230
catastrophe,
so you know,

723
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:32,231
it's reasonable.
It seems reasonable to me to presume 

724
00:42:32,231 --> 00:42:32,330
that that those experiments have already
been run.

725
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:38,560
All right,
so now you like Dostoevsky was very 

726
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:44,351
interested in returning to sources of 
meaning from which he believed that our 

727
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:47,720
original religious ideas had emerged.

728
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,450
And this is partly his notion of the 
collective unconscious.

729
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:55,870
So you know,
part of the radical critique of 

730
00:42:55,870 --> 00:43:00,191
religious systems is predicated on the 
idea that there's something like 

731
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:03,911
conscious beliefs are articulated 
beliefs that you could lay out in a 

732
00:43:03,911 --> 00:43:05,600
credo,
but,

733
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,270
but that's not right.
It doesn't seem to be correct at all.

734
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:13,271
And Nietzsche actually knew this.
He knew that a lot of our social 

735
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:16,481
institutions had emerged from the bottom
up and it only become articulated after 

736
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:19,250
they'd been embodied and danced out.
Essentially,

737
00:43:19,251 --> 00:43:24,251
you know,
you are a tribal group learns how to 

738
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:28,331
organize itself over thousands and 
thousands of years of trial and error 

739
00:43:28,331 --> 00:43:29,180
and pushing against each other and so 
forth.

740
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:34,181
And they come into that tribal grouping 
with a biological substrate and there 

741
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:38,861
are sociological and political 
interactions are constrained by all of 

742
00:43:38,861 --> 00:43:43,811
those things.
And then maybe they come up with a 

743
00:43:43,811 --> 00:43:45,821
description of that over time,
the self description and an articulated 

744
00:43:45,821 --> 00:43:45,821
representation.

745
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:50,950
And that's the religious system.
It's not that the religious system is 

746
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:54,560
thought up first as a system of 
metaphysical presuppositions,

747
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:59,590
images and dreams,
then turn it into rules then imposed on 

748
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,120
the population who then obeys it.
And generally speaking,

749
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:04,530
when people criticized,
um,

750
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,370
formal religion,
they criticized it,

751
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,650
assuming that that's how it had 
developed,

752
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:11,540
you know,
and that's kind of a Marxist idea,

753
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:16,541
for example,
that religion is the opiate of the 

754
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:16,541
masses and that,
you know,

755
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:20,201
the religious structures were laid out 
so that a small elite could control the 

756
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:21,200
population.
Now,

757
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,930
you know,
in virtually every domain,

758
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,370
a small elite emerges that dominates the
population.

759
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,360
I don't care what domain you look at.
So mark's is accurate in that way,

760
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,460
in that,
you know,

761
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,520
there's always a power imbalance between
elite minority and majority.

762
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:46,700
But to say that that's the cause of all 
the systems that people interact within 

763
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:49,990
is wild.
It's,

764
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,260
it's,
it's,

765
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,200
I'm sophisticated beyond belief.
What it does is it takes phenomena.

766
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:58,700
There are complex beyond comprehension 
and reduce them to one thing.

767
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:00,440
It's not helpful like,
you know,

768
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,610
here's an example.

769
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:03,990
Um,

770
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,810
if you,
if you sampled popular songs on the,

771
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,840
on Youtube,
let's say you made a graph of how 

772
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,001
popular songs were,
what you find is that about 10 songs at 

773
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:19,560
any given time are played,

774
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:26,290
half of all the songs played at any 
given time are going to be one of 10 

775
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,160
songs.
Well,

776
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,200
and then what the other thing you'd find
is that half of all songs played are 

777
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,450
played by one or more of 10 musicians.
And that's true,

778
00:45:35,451 --> 00:45:36,360
no matter,
you know,

779
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,870
if you look all the way from the 19,
32 now,

780
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,180
if you look at popular music,
you see the same thing.

781
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:46,480
Almost everything that almost everyone 
listens to is created by very few 

782
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,030
people.
And then there's millions of musicians,

783
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,030
but you've never heard of most of them.
And you'll never hear a song.

784
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,250
For most,
it's a small minority.

785
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:58,190
And what you see as in any field of 
creative production,

786
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:03,490
this happens.
A small elite emerges and dominates the 

787
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:05,270
entire landscape.
Now,

788
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,050
you know,
it's kind of,

789
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:12,070
it would be kind of ridiculous to assume
that the 10 most popular singers and 

790
00:46:12,141 --> 00:46:14,350
musicians that are currently operative 
word,

791
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,050
those who gave rise to the system that 
allowed them to thrive.

792
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,590
I mean obviously that's a dopey idea and
it's,

793
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,310
it's,
it's,

794
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:27,370
it's no more an intelligent idea.
When you look at any other domain where 

795
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,020
there's tremendous variation and the 
emergence of an elite,

796
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:32,600
it's a very common phenomenon.
It happens,

797
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:34,190
as I said,
it happens anywhere.

798
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,580
There's creative production,
so that's why one percent of the people,

799
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:38,450
you know,
roughly half,

800
00:46:38,451 --> 00:46:41,040
50 percent of the money,
it's no different in,

801
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,770
in other creative domains.
Now we'll talk later in the course about

802
00:46:45,771 --> 00:46:50,771
why that happens,
but to think it's because those people 

803
00:46:50,771 --> 00:46:51,860
set up the system so that they could 
thrive this.

804
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:58,060
Well.
There's an element of that obviously 

805
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,611
because once you're rich,
you're going to prefer political 

806
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:04,481
policies that helped you stay rich.
But that doesn't mean that you set up 

807
00:47:04,481 --> 00:47:05,720
the whole damn system that made you rich
to begin with.

808
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:10,840
Plus,
it's not the same people over any 

809
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:10,840
reasonable span of time.

810
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,070
So the one percent of people who have 
most of the money,

811
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:18,220
it's always one percent,
but it's not the same people each in 

812
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,830
individuals tend to hold onto money for 
very short periods of time and big 

813
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:23,790
companies don't last very long.
You know,

814
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,270
they,
they last on average about 30,

815
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:28,190
35,
40 years and that's it.

816
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:30,210
Then they disappear.
So what does,

817
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:35,230
because you know,
the economic landscape is just churning 

818
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:36,790
like Mac.
It's very difficult for a company to,

819
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:42,180
you know,
there's not that many big steam coach 

820
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:42,180
companies anymore,
you know,

821
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:42,180
and,
and,

822
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,951
and nobody makes zepplins and nobody 
makes typewriters and you know what I 

823
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:51,721
mean is things move quick and just 
because you dominated the landscape at 

824
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:55,261
one particular moment doesn't mean 
you're going to be able to do it that 

825
00:47:55,261 --> 00:47:55,261
the next.
So,

826
00:47:55,261 --> 00:48:00,130
all right,
so the create your own meaning thing is 

827
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:00,130
a rough one.

828
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,660
And then there's another problem too,
which is what makes you think you have 

829
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,690
enough time.
You know,

830
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:10,740
lots of times people come to me and they
have relationship problems and part of 

831
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,800
the problem is is that they've set their
relationships up outside of social norms

832
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,330
and they do that,
you know,

833
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:18,190
so they'll say something to me,
something like,

834
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:23,460
well,
we're not going to get married because 

835
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,081
marriage is just a piece of paper,
which is really a stupid thing to say 

836
00:48:25,081 --> 00:48:25,960
like it's an incredibly stupid thing to 
say,

837
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:31,140
but underneath that there's this idea 
that they want to remain free of social 

838
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,400
constraints so that they can negotiate 
their own way.

839
00:48:33,401 --> 00:48:37,060
Like if you're giving them credit for 
wanting freedom instead of just escaping

840
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:39,700
responsibility.
But the problem with that is it's like,

841
00:48:39,701 --> 00:48:41,470
okay,
good luck.

842
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,710
Try it.
I don't know why you would assume that 

843
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:50,131
you have enough time in the 30 or 40 
years that you're going to be pursuing 

844
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:53,050
relationships to actually figure out how
they should run.

845
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,100
You don't have a hope of that and it's 
worse too because very,

846
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,880
very few people can negotiate,
you know,

847
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:04,980
because here's the way it works.
You either adhere to the social order or

848
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:09,940
you stand outside as soon as you stand 
outside of it,

849
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:14,941
you're in a chaotic place because 
there's no guidelines and then you 

850
00:49:14,941 --> 00:49:18,691
either live chaotically because there's 
no guidelines or you start to formulate 

851
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:22,990
order.
But to do that you have to know what you

852
00:49:22,991 --> 00:49:27,991
want and you have to know how to express
it and then you have to figure out what 

853
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:31,810
your partner wants and help them express
it.

854
00:49:31,811 --> 00:49:34,030
And then you have to negotiate a 
solution.

855
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:38,470
Well,
I would say one in 20 people know how to

856
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:40,660
negotiate.
It's really,

857
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:43,000
really difficult.
If you mean just think of the steps.

858
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:48,001
First of all,
you have to know what you want and then 

859
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:48,001
you have to admit it to yourself.

860
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:48,001
Well,
yeah,

861
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:48,880
right.
Like you,

862
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,950
you're not even going to get to the 
first one.

863
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:52,930
In all likelihood.
What do you want?

864
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,350
A lot of what you want can't be 
articulated even,

865
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,270
you know,
I'll give you an example.

866
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:03,870
So there's a great study done awhile 
back on the prediction of mayor of,

867
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,570
of a relationship longevity.
Okay.

868
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,490
So here was the question,
um,

869
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,820
how many negative interactions do you 
have to have per set of positive?

870
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,600
Sorry?
How many positive interactions per 

871
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,911
negative interaction do you have to have
with your partner in order for the 

872
00:50:23,911 --> 00:50:25,870
relationship to remain stable?
Okay,

873
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:30,871
so let's say you have one negative 
interaction to every one positive 

874
00:50:30,871 --> 00:50:31,400
interaction.
Okay.

875
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:33,590
Or maybe have 10 negatives to every 
positive.

876
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:37,100
Then you could imagine a different 
situation where you have 100 positive to

877
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,830
one negative spanning the whole 
potential.

878
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:44,360
Continue and you use that to predict 
relationship satisfaction and longevity.

879
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,840
While you might think,
well God obviously 100 positive to one 

880
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,220
negative is where is the preferable 
ratio?

881
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:54,500
And so it's those people who,
you know,

882
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:58,670
their relationship is nothing but 
constant compliments and bliss.

883
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:00,710
They're the ones who last.
It's not true.

884
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,700
What you see is that there's a,
there's a,

885
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:07,880
an optimal,
an optimal ratio domain.

886
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,170
If it falls below five to one positive 
to negative,

887
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,980
then your relationship falls apart.
It's too negative.

888
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,400
And it's partly because people feel 
negative emotion more than they feel 

889
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,000
positive emotions because you can be 
hurt more than you can be.

890
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:26,780
Pleased.
And so one that's only five to one is to

891
00:51:26,781 --> 00:51:29,330
punishing and people won't,
won't stay in.

892
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:34,460
But if you get above 11 to one,
it gets not punishing enough.

893
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,380
And you think,
well,

894
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:38,300
what does that mean exactly?
Well,

895
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,460
what do you want in a relationship?
Well,

896
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:42,470
you think bliss.

897
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,690
It's like that isn't what you want.
As it turns out,

898
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:46,880
it's more like you want someone to 
contend with,

899
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,050
you know,
you don't want to push over.

900
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,470
You don't want everything to be easy,
you know,

901
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:56,471
and this is the sort of the sort of 
phenomena that kierkegaard was talking 

902
00:51:56,751 --> 00:52:01,751
about when he talked about deciding to 
make things more difficult for people 

903
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:02,000
because that's what they need.
You know,

904
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,080
you know this perfectly well because if 
you go out with someone and they worship

905
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:11,081
you and they don't on your every word 
and there's nothing but positive 

906
00:52:11,081 --> 00:52:14,650
feedback coming from them,
you lose respect for them almost an 

907
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:17,531
instantly.
And you go wander off and find someone 

908
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:19,751
who's more interesting.
And part of the reason for that I think 

909
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:23,411
is that you want the person that you're 
with to challenge you so that not only 

910
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,260
do you do reasonably well data gate day 
together,

911
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:32,261
you know,
so you can coexist in the same space 

912
00:52:32,261 --> 00:52:35,501
with a reasonable amount of pace,
but you also want there to be enough 

913
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:38,891
tension in the relationship so that 
you're both involved in a process of 

914
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:42,560
mutual transformation while try 
specifying that in an articulated way,

915
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,450
you know,
good luck,

916
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,780
you know,
and it also explains strange things 

917
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,900
about people like the fact that they'll 
stay in pretty negative relationships.

918
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,900
Like what the hell are you doing there?
If you had articulated it two years ago 

919
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,150
and you said,
well,

920
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:59,390
I want to be with someone,
I'm miserable with half the time,

921
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,760
of course you're never going to say 
that,

922
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,040
but it could easily be that that's what 
you're after.

923
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,410
So.
Well,

924
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:12,250
so alright,
now heidegger is another philosopher who

925
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
was attempting in some sense to solve 
the problems that were laid out by 

926
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,651
Nietzsche and Dostoevsky.
And the way that heidegger heidegger 

927
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:28,230
began to resolve them was by a radically
new lookout philosophy itself,

928
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,310
and he was,
he was,

929
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,640
he was one of the prime phenomenologists
and I told you a while back that the 

930
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,051
phenomenologists decided to reconstitute
western philosophy.

931
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:45,630
So that was focusing on being instead of
knowledge.

932
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,080
And so the hardest thing to grasp about 
the phenomenologists is what exactly 

933
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,120
they meant by being an.
So I'll give you a,

934
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,520
I'll give you a overview of that.

935
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,520
So that's where the term Dad's side 
comes from and that's a German term and 

936
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,941
it means being there.
And so right now you're encapsulated in 

937
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:08,421
a data site and the design is the 
totality of your experience and that 

938
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:12,870
experience would be an experience of the
extended world,

939
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:18,120
the natural world,
and then the social world.

940
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:23,810
And then inside that the world of your 
subjective experience and that 

941
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:27,810
constitutes being.
And the phenomenologists make the case.

942
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,590
They're not playing this subject object 
gate and they're standing outside of the

943
00:54:31,591 --> 00:54:36,591
division between subject and object.
That's part of the scientific world 

944
00:54:36,591 --> 00:54:39,661
view.
So it's a real paradigm shift in that 

945
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:43,761
you can't use the rules from the old way
of looking at things inside the new way 

946
00:54:43,761 --> 00:54:48,291
of looking at things.
You have to start with new 

947
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:48,291
presupposition.
So we might say,

948
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:52,161
well,
one of the things that you're going to 

949
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:52,230
do if you look at things 
phenomenologically,

950
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:55,290
is to assume that everything that you 
experienced is real.

951
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:01,490
So,
so then we would say that there's no 

952
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:05,130
attempt in that phenomenal logical world
to reduce pain to something material.

953
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:09,370
Pain stands as stands itself as a 
phenomena,

954
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,670
so does anxiety,
so does joy.

955
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:16,430
All the things that the scientists of 
consciousness called Kaleo,

956
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,850
which are viewed by them as qualities of
the objective world,

957
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:23,010
aren't viewed that way by the 
phenomenologists.

958
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:26,250
They just say those are primary elements
of being.

959
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:32,210
So it's a very interesting way of 
looking at things because it kind of 

960
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,960
allows you to reclaim the validity of 
your own experience.

961
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:35,490
You can no longer say,
well,

962
00:55:35,491 --> 00:55:40,491
that's only subjective and that doesn't 
mean that everything you played 

963
00:55:40,491 --> 00:55:45,350
subjectively is true objectively or for 
other people.

964
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,960
What it does mean is that everything 
that you experience subjectively is 

965
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,780
real.
Now,

966
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:56,781
that doesn't mean you.
You have to not think about it or take 

967
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:56,781
it apart or categorize it properly.

968
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:57,870
You still have to do all of those 
things,

969
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,440
but you're.
You're put into a place where there is 

970
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:08,601
no need to deny the reality of your own 
experience or to subordinate it to 

971
00:56:08,601 --> 00:56:11,220
something else.
So for example,

972
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:13,740
if I'm doing dream analysis with 
someone,

973
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,530
which I do often,
if people dream,

974
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,100
because dreams as you pointed out,
are there they are.

975
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,610
They're manifestations of being.
You don't come up with them.

976
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:29,910
They appear to you.
They sort of appear out of nowhere in 

977
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:30,550
some sense.
They manifest themselves.

978
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,280
They do.
It strangely began and I think the 

979
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,630
reason for that is that they contain 
unarticulated thought,

980
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,130
but if you can get a handle on them and 
assess them,

981
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:45,130
then sometimes they can tell you things 
that there's no other way you can figure

982
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:50,131
out.
And what's really cool about them is 

983
00:56:50,131 --> 00:56:52,021
that they're.
They have the same impersonality as 

984
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:57,571
phenomena in the,
like the broader world of experience.

985
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:01,420
Have you know you don't ever think about
the truth of a chair,

986
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,480
it's just there and dreams are like 
that.

987
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:09,481
They're just there and if you can 
untangle what they have to what they 

988
00:57:09,481 --> 00:57:14,041
indicate,
then you can get a take on your own 

989
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:14,470
experience that's not

990
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:23,120
altered by any of your local subjective 
wishes and desires.

991
00:57:23,121 --> 00:57:26,870
I hate to use the word subjective in 
this sort of context.

992
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,490
So phenomenology is the study of being 
now,

993
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:36,550
now and in being.
There are variety of aspects and so one 

994
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:38,300
aspect,
I never remember the names of these,

995
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:41,210
but I'll get it here right away.
Oh yes.

996
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:47,600
Heidegger broke the world of experience 
being into three basic categories.

997
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:52,601
There was the [inaudible],
which I think is basically the world 

998
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:56,321
beyond culture and the individual.
There's the midwest and that's the world

999
00:57:57,351 --> 00:58:02,351
that we share with everyone else.
So that's roughly the social world and 

1000
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:03,230
the social structures.
And then there's the eigenvalue which is

1001
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:08,590
that domain of experience that's unique 
to you that other people can't partake 

1002
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:12,881
in.
So those are the elements of being as 

1003
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:15,581
far as the phenomenologists were 
concerned and in those domains of being 

1004
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,080
different experiences manifest 
themselves.

1005
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:25,220
We talked about some of the ones that 
would be manifestations of the

1006
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,110
I can belt.

1007
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:33,200
Scientists would call those things 
emotional or motivational states.

1008
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,020
Normally people think of them as 
feelings,

1009
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:40,220
I would say I feel that's I feel such 
and such,

1010
00:58:40,221 --> 00:58:45,221
and those are experiences that,
that manifest themselves to you or that 

1011
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:49,190
you have,
depending on how you look at it that are

1012
00:58:49,191 --> 00:58:53,930
indicative of the manner in which you 
should act in relationship to being.

1013
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,900
Now,
one of,

1014
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:02,590
part of the reason that this is relevant
to psychotherapy in particular was 

1015
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:03,050
because the,
the,

1016
00:59:03,051 --> 00:59:08,051
uh,
the phenomenologists were very 

1017
00:59:08,051 --> 00:59:08,051
interested in the manifestation of 
meaning.

1018
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:10,520
So you could say,
well,

1019
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:16,330
nihilism is the absence of meaning and 
totalitarianism is the fixed edness of 

1020
00:59:16,521 --> 00:59:17,270
meaning,
right?

1021
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:22,630
If you're a totalitarian,
what you do is say all exist in 

1022
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:26,861
relationship to this structure.
It's almost as if from the 

1023
00:59:26,861 --> 00:59:27,890
phenomenologists would say you're trying
to reduce the,

1024
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,340
the weld,
which is the natural world,

1025
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,340
the Mip dwelled,
which is the social world.

1026
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,410
And the Eigen belt,
which is your own world,

1027
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:41,411
you're trying to reduce all of that to 
the well so that everything falls under 

1028
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,140
an explanation that's granted to you by 
some higher authority.

1029
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:50,270
And then of course the nihilists art are
having none of that.

1030
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,140
They see,
they,

1031
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,190
they,
they use their eigen felt,

1032
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:59,660
I would say their own world to 
invalidate meaning in any domain.

1033
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,690
Now the phenomenologists would say,
well,

1034
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:07,150
it's a mistake to use your rationality 
to undermine the,

1035
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,220
the sense,
the manifestation of meaning.

1036
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:15,430
And I can give you an example of that.
So let's say you're a good nihilist and 

1037
01:00:15,621 --> 01:00:18,500
you think that maybe you're going to go 
do something difficult,

1038
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:23,530
like put yourself through university and
then you think in a relatively depressed

1039
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:28,630
state of mind,
maybe you encountered some obstacles of 

1040
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:28,630
one form or another,
and you think,

1041
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:29,630
oh,
to hell with this.

1042
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,090
Who's,
what difference does it make anyways?

1043
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,670
Who cares if I go and get my degree?
You know,

1044
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:37,430
none of this knowledge is particularly 
relevant or meaningful,

1045
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:40,070
and who the hell is going to know the 
difference in a million years?

1046
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:41,840
And so you think,
well,

1047
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:44,420
that's a perfectly rational,
um,

1048
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:49,190
dismissal because who is going to know 
in a million years or let's say,

1049
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:54,191
well,
even if you could make a case that 

1050
01:00:54,191 --> 01:00:54,890
someone might know there might be some 
effects left of you in a million years,

1051
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:59,270
then we'll just multiply it by 100,000
and go to a trillion years.

1052
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:04,271
So here you are,
you're this little tiny speck on a 

1053
01:01:04,271 --> 01:01:06,791
slightly bigger speck in the middle of a
galaxy that has god only knows how many 

1054
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:12,221
billion stars.
And then there's a billion of those 

1055
01:01:12,221 --> 01:01:14,651
galaxies.
Although there's way more than that and 

1056
01:01:14,651 --> 01:01:15,080
they're spread across this tremendous 
expanse of time.

1057
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:18,560
And in the face of all that,
who cares what you do?

1058
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,040
Well,
what a phenomenologist would say is,

1059
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:27,041
okay,
let's look at how meaning manifests 

1060
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:32,260
itself when you alter your own

1061
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:39,390
private world in a variety of manners.
So let's say you're trying to do 

1062
01:01:41,051 --> 01:01:42,460
something.
Maybe you're working in a,

1063
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,720
maybe you're working as a volunteer in a
hospital helping sick kids.

1064
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:51,721
You know,
you're reading to them so that they're 

1065
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:51,721
distracted from their pain.
And you say,

1066
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:52,570
well,
when their trillion years,

1067
01:01:52,571 --> 01:01:54,460
who's going to know the difference?
And so you think,

1068
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,430
well,
it's meaningless to do this.

1069
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:01,270
The phenomenologists would say if the 
frame of reference that you're using,

1070
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,580
like if you're.
If you're imposing,

1071
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:10,140
if you're transforming the way you're 
being manifests itself so that it 

1072
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:14,430
becomes meaningless and observed,
then you should try experiencing it in a

1073
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:19,330
different manner.
So it's d,

1074
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:24,380
c,
because a rationalist in some sense the 

1075
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:24,810
phenomenology say a rationalist can't 
deal with the argument.

1076
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:28,260
What difference is it going to make an a
trillion years and here you are,

1077
01:02:28,261 --> 01:02:30,500
a little dust speck among all these 
other despots.

1078
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,630
It's ultimately meaningless.
A phenomenologist would say maximize the

1079
01:02:37,511 --> 01:02:39,820
meaning.
That's the.

1080
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:44,880
That's the marker of truth and it's a.
it's a completely different way of 

1081
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,880
thinking about it.
So he would say,

1082
01:02:45,881 --> 01:02:50,881
for example,
that if you're going to a hospital and 

1083
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:54,091
you're reading to sick children,
that the frame of reference that you 

1084
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:58,201
should use,
the way that you allow that experience 

1085
01:02:58,201 --> 01:03:01,501
to manifest itself should be such that 
the experience manifests itself so that 

1086
01:03:02,471 --> 01:03:06,550
it's as meaningful as possible rather 
than is meaning less.

1087
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,010
The idea being that just because you can

1088
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,400
twist your own experience so that 
certain elements of your being become 

1089
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:22,270
meaningless does not mean that that's 
right.

1090
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:27,930
The fact that it becomes meaningless 
actually means that it's wrong because 

1091
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:32,611
you think you see it all depends on what
you allow to be primary,

1092
01:03:33,371 --> 01:03:38,371
and this is the phenomenologists point.
If you allow your strict rationality to 

1093
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:41,680
be primary than if it can attack 
something and destroy it,

1094
01:03:41,681 --> 01:03:45,080
then that thing is worthy of being 
attacked and destroyed.

1095
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,380
But if you flip it around and you say,
well,

1096
01:03:47,381 --> 01:03:52,381
what you should be doing is allowing is 
interacting with your experience or 

1097
01:03:53,261 --> 01:03:58,261
allowing your experience to manifest 
itself in a manner that situates you 

1098
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:03,510
most meaningfully in the here and now.
Whatever framework you're using to do 

1099
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:06,580
that,
that works is right.

1100
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:10,330
That's a completely different way of 
looking at things and it's a real.

1101
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:13,390
It's a real escape from the pathology of
rationalism.

1102
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:19,280
No,
because it isn't obvious that what you 

1103
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,311
think should take priority.
Now the phenomenologists would go 

1104
01:04:23,311 --> 01:04:24,400
farther than that.
They would say that,

1105
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,560
and this is something,
so here's a way of thinking about it.

1106
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,350
So bins,
Wanger Sad.

1107
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,840
What we perceive our first and foremost 
bins.

1108
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:45,730
Wanger was a psychiatrist who is very 
much influenced in sweating your boss,

1109
01:04:45,731 --> 01:04:50,731
where the people going to talk about 
mostly were very much influenced by 

1110
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:53,471
Heidegger area and ideas.
I say what we perceive our first and 

1111
01:04:53,471 --> 01:04:55,030
foremost,
not impressions of taste,

1112
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:58,420
smell or touch.
Not even things or objects,

1113
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,330
but meanings.
Okay,

1114
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:06,331
so the idea for the phenomenologists is 
that what being is made out of is 

1115
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:10,441
meaning.
It isn't that the objective world is 

1116
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:11,470
made out of things.
It's that being is made out of meaning.

1117
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:16,500
Now,
some of those meetings can be positive 

1118
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:16,500
and some of them can be negative and 
some of them can be neutral,

1119
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:21,480
but the constituent elements of being 
the fundamental constituent element of 

1120
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:26,041
being his meaning,
and then there is an argument between 

1121
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:28,450
been swagger in Boston about how that 
meaning manifest itself,

1122
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:32,650
so been swaying or would say that you 
endow meaning on the world,

1123
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:37,710
so that's kind of a Nietzschean idea 
that you create your own values so that 

1124
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:41,671
you have within you something he called 
an a priori ontological structure,

1125
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:47,100
so world designed or a matrix of meaning
that determines how the world manifests 

1126
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:47,200
itself to you.

1127
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:52,230
Now the easiest way to think about that 
is that you know you're thrown into a 

1128
01:05:52,331 --> 01:05:55,390
particular time and place.
That's another existentialist idea,

1129
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:57,760
and that's part of the absurdity of your
life,

1130
01:05:57,761 --> 01:06:02,761
is that you're here.
Now in this particular context and 

1131
01:06:02,761 --> 01:06:06,511
situation,
it's something you have to contend with 

1132
01:06:06,511 --> 01:06:09,210
and that's true for everyone.
They're arbitrary preconditions to 

1133
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:11,200
everyone's being and one of those 
arbitrary preconditions is the structure

1134
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:16,120
through which you look at the world and 
that structure enables some things to be

1135
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:18,280
highlighted in some things to be 
ignored,

1136
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:23,110
and so the way that meaning manifests 
itself is a reflection of this,

1137
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:28,330
a priori ontological structure,
the mode of being so there can't be 

1138
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:33,370
being which is say your experience for 
the sake of our argument,

1139
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,900
without the structure that consists of 
you,

1140
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,560
that that you consist up and so that's a
given and it's.

1141
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:45,100
It's the action of that structure that 
determines the meaning of things.

1142
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:50,490
Now boss would say exactly the opposite.
He would say that's the wrong way of 

1143
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:56,131
looking at it.
You should look at the totality of your 

1144
01:06:56,131 --> 01:06:58,900
existence,
which is partly the broad natural world,

1145
01:06:58,901 --> 01:07:00,820
the cultural world,
and your own world,

1146
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:05,950
and you should note that meaning arises 
in different places of its own accord.

1147
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,810
You can't.
You can't reduce it to the action,

1148
01:07:09,811 --> 01:07:13,150
say of this ontological,
a priority ontological structure,

1149
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:17,020
and so one example would be,
well,

1150
01:07:17,021 --> 01:07:19,630
what about the meaning of things you 
don't understand?

1151
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:25,740
Well,
it's hard to understand how the meaning 

1152
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:26,800
of things you don't understand can be 
attributed to what you understand.

1153
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,560
The meaning seems to be there to begin 
with.

1154
01:07:29,561 --> 01:07:31,750
So here's an example.
Your,

1155
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:34,570
your.
You have a relationship with someone and

1156
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:37,330
you discover that they have an affair.
Well,

1157
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:41,110
the discovery of the affair is going to 
be something that's meaningful.

1158
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:46,310
Now you don't know what the meaning is.
You're going to interpret it to begin 

1159
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:49,321
with likely very negatively,
except to the degree that part of you 

1160
01:07:49,321 --> 01:07:50,440
would like to escape out of the 
relationship,

1161
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,220
right?
Because sometimes if you're betrayed,

1162
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,990
you're happy about it because it's time 
for that to be overweight,

1163
01:07:56,020 --> 01:08:01,020
but in any case,
there are things that you can encounter 

1164
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:04,711
that you don't understand,
that are meaningful in and of 

1165
01:08:04,711 --> 01:08:07,050
themselves.
So I think that you actually can't 

1166
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:11,281
separate your structure from the 
structure of everything.

1167
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:16,190
They're always interacting and meaning 
emerges out of the interplay of those.

1168
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:18,200
So here's another way of thinking about 
it.

1169
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:22,220
You're reading a book.
The book is meaningful.

1170
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,600
Where is the meaning?
Is it in your head?

1171
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,800
Is it in the book?
While it's very difficult to say,

1172
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:35,801
right,
because obviously there's a subjective 

1173
01:08:35,801 --> 01:08:36,080
element to it.
There's an element that's unique to you,

1174
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:41,290
but just as obviously that meaning 
wouldn't manifest itself if it wasn't 

1175
01:08:42,021 --> 01:08:47,021
for the book and of course the book 
wouldn't be meaningful if you end the 

1176
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:50,471
book weren't embedded in this complex 
structure and so the meaning is an 

1177
01:08:50,471 --> 01:08:50,870
emergent property.

1178
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:56,210
The meeting is an emergent property of 
the interplay of all of the elements of 

1179
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,420
being.
That's a very interesting way of looking

1180
01:08:59,421 --> 01:09:02,450
at things.
So you have all these elements of PA and

1181
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,420
their dance produces meaning of one form
or another.

1182
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:10,720
Now you might say if you were a 
phenomenologist that some of that 

1183
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,781
meaning is going to be life sustaining 
and some of it is going to be life 

1184
01:09:13,781 --> 01:09:17,771
destroying and the phenomenologists 
would say from a clinical perspective 

1185
01:09:17,771 --> 01:09:19,880
that your,
if your.

1186
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:23,630
If you are,
if you exist in a system of meaning,

1187
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:27,770
revelations that are life destroying,
that you should turn your attention away

1188
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:30,770
from them towards meetings that are life
affirming.

1189
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:36,400
And you know,
one of the things that's quite 

1190
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,891
interesting about the phenomenal logical
perspective is that you can experiment 

1191
01:09:38,891 --> 01:09:39,740
with it quite easily.
So I could say to you,

1192
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:44,741
for example,
a couple of phenomenological 

1193
01:09:44,741 --> 01:09:46,310
experiments,
one would be for the next two weeks,

1194
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:52,310
you want to detach yourself in some 
sense so that you're a curious observer 

1195
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:54,110
of your being.

1196
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,990
You're not necessarily trying to direct 
it,

1197
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,540
you know you're just trying to let it 
unfold.

1198
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:04,900
And then what you might want to watch 
for is when the meaning that manifests 

1199
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:10,451
itself as,
as things flow around you is clearly 

1200
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,580
meaning of the life affirming type.
Now you'll see that,

1201
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:21,610
you know,
it depends on how well situated you are 

1202
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:23,360
in some sense because if you're,
if you're surrounded by,

1203
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,920
if your experiential field is primarily 
negative,

1204
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:30,200
these are going to be relatively rare 
events,

1205
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:34,250
but they will still not be nonexistent.
They might only happen for a few seconds

1206
01:10:34,251 --> 01:10:36,440
or a few minutes every day or every few 
days.

1207
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:37,760
But so say,
okay,

1208
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:42,761
you notice that all of a sudden you're 
in a place where things are the way you 

1209
01:10:42,761 --> 01:10:44,300
would like them to be.
So you could say you're in a place where

1210
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:47,660
being is manifesting itself as 
acceptable.

1211
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:53,530
Okay,
so that's a place where nihilism is not 

1212
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:53,530
appropriate.

1213
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:56,210
It doesn't apply because of the quality 
of the experience is such that it's life

1214
01:10:56,211 --> 01:11:01,211
affirming.
You have to notice that it's something 

1215
01:11:01,211 --> 01:11:01,370
that happens and then you might ask 
yourself,

1216
01:11:01,371 --> 01:11:02,450
well,
okay,

1217
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:05,630
what are the preconditions that enabled 
that?

1218
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:12,340
What are the preconditions that enabled 
all of the different sub elements of 

1219
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,971
being to work harmoniously together at 
that time in place so that that was the 

1220
01:11:16,561 --> 01:11:21,561
meaning that emerged and then the next 
question might be how would it be 

1221
01:11:21,561 --> 01:11:25,500
possible for me to allow that to happen 
more frequently?

1222
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:30,750
And so you can tilt yourself towards 
life affirming meetings in a way from,

1223
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:35,550
from say meanings that are associated 
with disparate nihilism,

1224
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:40,551
but you do that partly.
It's almost like you're navigating in a 

1225
01:11:40,551 --> 01:11:40,551
boat.
In fact,

1226
01:11:40,551 --> 01:11:44,691
I think you are.
I think you're navigating to find the 

1227
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:46,110
line between order and chaos because 
that's where the meaning is.

1228
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:51,140
That's exactly where the meaning is.
And you can feel it like it's a place 

1229
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,801
and that's the other thing.
The phenomenologists are trying to get 

1230
01:11:54,801 --> 01:11:57,051
across these things are real.
They're not secondary manifestations of 

1231
01:11:57,841 --> 01:12:00,870
some deeper reality.
They are reality itself.

1232
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:06,230
I also think,
and we'll talk about this more when we 

1233
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:06,230
get to the neuropsychological portion of
the course,

1234
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,680
that your brain is actually set up first
and foremost to detect meaning.

1235
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,920
You detect meaning before you detect 
objects and it's partly because you.

1236
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:22,130
You have to detect meetings so that you 
know what to do when something happens 

1237
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:24,930
very rapidly and there are times when 
you have to figure out what to do before

1238
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:27,000
you have enough time to even see what's 
there.

1239
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:30,180
You just don't have the time.
So you know,

1240
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,260
part of the question is,
well,

1241
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:34,150
what exactly do you mean by meaning?
You know,

1242
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:39,340
I think meaning is significance for 
behavior or significance for this 

1243
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,160
structure that governs behavior,
but those are very,

1244
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:44,260
very basic fundamental perceptions 
there.

1245
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:49,440
They're not.
You see the object and then you derive 

1246
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:49,440
the meaning.
It's exactly the opposite.

1247
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:54,111
Many cases you perceive the meaning and 
derive the object and there's plenty of 

1248
01:12:54,211 --> 01:12:57,090
neurophysiological evidence for that.
For example,

1249
01:12:57,091 --> 01:13:02,091
you have lots of,
you know your retina is a pattern 

1250
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:05,481
detector and the retinal information is 
transmitted to your brain alone,

1251
01:13:05,641 --> 01:13:07,350
the optic nerve,
the optic nerve,

1252
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,350
branches,
and it goes lots of places in your body.

1253
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,500
Some of it maps right onto your spinal 
cord so that your eyes can make your 

1254
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:19,341
body move.
Some of it maps onto your Amygdala so 

1255
01:13:19,341 --> 01:13:22,761
that what you perceive are the meanings 
of facial expressions without even 

1256
01:13:22,761 --> 01:13:26,271
perceiving the face.
So you can have people who have 

1257
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:26,271
blindsight,
a damaged visual cortex.

1258
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:30,030
You can show them angry faces,
which they say they can't see,

1259
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:35,210
but they'll respond to them electro 
physiologically it as if they're being 

1260
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:39,141
exposed to something negative and it's 
because of the retinal pattern is 

1261
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:40,980
manifesting itself right onto the 
system.

1262
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:45,120
That maps one form of meaning so you can
clearly have meaning without,

1263
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:50,570
without object perception.
And so the idea that you derive the 

1264
01:13:50,570 --> 01:13:52,230
meaning from the object.
You see the thing and then you attribute

1265
01:13:52,231 --> 01:13:53,750
meaning to the thing.
That's.

1266
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,520
That's right.
At some levels of analysis,

1267
01:13:56,521 --> 01:13:59,070
but it's wrong and many other levels of 
analysis.

1268
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:04,670
And so the other thing I think that you 
can try that's phenomenologically 

1269
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:09,220
informed.
This is quite an interesting trick.

1270
01:14:09,221 --> 01:14:10,700
It can really.
It's really hard on you.

1271
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:13,870
Those be careful if you try this.
So one,

1272
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:17,440
another thing you could try for two 
weeks is to watch what you say.

1273
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,210
You've got to detach yourself.
Again,

1274
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:24,510
you have to remove the belief that your 
thoughts and you are the same thing.

1275
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:34,570
And then you have to watch mostly what 
you say and then you have to see.

1276
01:14:35,951 --> 01:14:39,190
And this is something that Rogers would 
also be an advocate.

1277
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:44,640
You have to see if what you say it makes
you feel what you have to see if what 

1278
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,010
you say improves the quality of your 
being or makes it worse.

1279
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:53,550
And you know,
if you start believing in what you say 

1280
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:54,370
and watch what the consequences are 
instead,

1281
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:58,570
how it manifests itself in terms of a 
transformation of being.

1282
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:03,750
Then you can also learn how to only say 
things that improve the quality of 

1283
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:04,330
being.
Well,

1284
01:15:04,331 --> 01:15:05,980
that's a good thing if you can manage 
it,

1285
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:07,460
but,
but it's,

1286
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:12,510
it's,
it's terrifying in some sense because 

1287
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:14,911
one of the things that you'll find is 
that hardly anything that you say does 

1288
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:18,541
that most of it's neutral,
but a fair bit of it has exactly the 

1289
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:20,620
opposite consequences.
It makes things worse.

1290
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:26,460
So I think I mentioned that the word 
phenomena,

1291
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:30,100
that's where the phenomenology,
the term phenomenology comes from.

1292
01:15:30,101 --> 01:15:35,101
Obviously the term phenomena means is 
from the Greek word famous thigh and 

1293
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:37,810
famous diet means to shine forth.

1294
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:43,380
And so the phenomenologies 
phenomenologists argument is that like 

1295
01:15:43,841 --> 01:15:48,841
being is made up of meanings that shine 
forth for you and that those different 

1296
01:15:48,841 --> 01:15:50,020
meanings attract you there.
They're like,

1297
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:52,390
they're like guide posts that you can 
follow.

1298
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,920
So you know,
one of the,

1299
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:56,530
I've noticed this for example in 
relationship to reading,

1300
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:01,270
so I'll be reading a complex tax and 
some passage will really strike me.

1301
01:16:01,271 --> 01:16:04,600
So it manifests itself as meaningful.
Why is that?

1302
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:06,730
Well,
you know,

1303
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:10,060
one of the phenomenologists which would 
be being been swagger,

1304
01:16:10,061 --> 01:16:10,570
we'd say,
well,

1305
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:12,730
it's because of the way that I'm 
structured,

1306
01:16:12,731 --> 01:16:14,020
but boss would say,
well,

1307
01:16:14,021 --> 01:16:17,860
no,
it's a dance that's occurring within the

1308
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:21,610
structure of everything and the 
consequence of that is the manifestation

1309
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:24,460
manifestation of this meaning.
Well,

1310
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:28,330
what I've found is that I can follow 
threads of meaning through books.

1311
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:31,300
You know that it's something that's 
guiding me,

1312
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:32,350
that sense of meaning.

1313
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:36,250
And often if I find something within a 
book that's meaningful,

1314
01:16:36,251 --> 01:16:40,510
then I'll read the other things that 
that person wrote and I'll see that some

1315
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:45,570
of the people that they read have 
meaningful things to say and then I can 

1316
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:45,840
branch out that network.
And it's.

1317
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:51,220
It's following a pathway that's laid out
for you in some sense that's laid out 

1318
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,350
for you in the world.
And you know,

1319
01:16:53,351 --> 01:16:56,680
the phenomenal logical idea is that if 
you follow that pathway,

1320
01:16:56,681 --> 01:17:01,681
then what happens is being becomes more 
and more integrated around you.

1321
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:09,360
And those experiences of,
of intrinsic meaning start to multiply 

1322
01:17:10,551 --> 01:17:12,710
and increase in intensity.
And you know,

1323
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:15,980
if you're able to do that over a long 
period of time,

1324
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:20,600
then you can get more and more of the 
totality of your being,

1325
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:25,160
revealing the kinds of meanings that 
stop you from being either nihilistic or

1326
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:27,710
totalitarian.
And so,

1327
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:28,910
well,
that's the basic.

1328
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:32,810
That's the fundamental theory of 
phenomenal logical psychotherapy.

1329
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,430
You know,
we might first say,

1330
01:17:34,431 --> 01:17:35,480
well,
you know,

1331
01:17:35,481 --> 01:17:38,360
you're depressed and anxious and your 
life isn't going very well.

1332
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,110
What keeps you afloat?
It's a,

1333
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,850
it's something to observe.
And then we might say,

1334
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:48,851
well,
are there ways that we can expand that 

1335
01:17:48,851 --> 01:17:53,711
small area that's keeping you afloat so 
that it starts to occupied more and more

1336
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:59,021
of your experience and push back the 
parts that are either neutral or 

1337
01:17:59,021 --> 01:17:59,960
negative and you know,
it's,

1338
01:17:59,961 --> 01:18:04,961
uh,
it's in large part a consequence of 

1339
01:18:04,961 --> 01:18:08,860
attention and,
and willingness to first of all,

1340
01:18:09,741 --> 01:18:11,990
treat things as if they're meaning is 
real.

1341
01:18:11,991 --> 01:18:16,991
And then second to allow that reality to
transform the way that you experience 

1342
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:23,561
things in the future.
See you Thursday.
