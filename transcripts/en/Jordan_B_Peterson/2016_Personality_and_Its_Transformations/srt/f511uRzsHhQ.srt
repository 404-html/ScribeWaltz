00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,590
Hi Guys,
so um,

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,230
we're going to talk about the brain 
today.

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,310
Last lecture I talked to you a little 
bit about construct validation and what 

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,961
it means to measure something.
And so we're gonna take a bit of a 

5
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:28,770
detour.
So I told you about measurement problems

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,340
last time.
If you do your measurement properly in 

7
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,830
psychometrics,
if you're studying personality,

8
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:39,450
if you're studying individual 
differences,

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,140
there are roughly six things that you 
can discover and they can be broken up 

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,830
different ways.
That's the big five model,

11
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:52,920
extroversion and neuroticism,
agreeableness,

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,420
conscientiousness,
openness,

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,450
and they can be subdivided as you should
know because it makes you read the 

14
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,261
paper,
the sub divided them into 10 APP turns 

15
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:06,381
out to be quite useful,
but for now we'll just presume that 

16
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:09,771
there are five.
And then the other factor of human 

17
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:13,860
function that's pretty easy to derive 
and measure his Iq.

18
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,460
Now,
Iq likely nests under openness.

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,390
Openness looks like it's something 
roughly like intellect,

20
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:26,391
which is interested in ideas,
but that's probably an ability with 

21
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:29,811
ideas,
but that's probably measured better by 

22
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:32,451
an Iq test.
So if I asked her how smart you are and 

23
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:35,121
you say you're pretty smart,
that would give you a relatively high 

24
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:36,210
score on the intellect scale,
but if I tested your Iq,

25
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:41,211
I will get a better measure that not so 
in some sense Iq nests inside the big 

26
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:43,380
five model.
But you can think about it as a separate

27
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,270
thing and I think it's reasonable to do 
that.

28
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,110
So,
you know,

29
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,910
it depends on what you're up to.
Fundamentally.

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,010
Now,
when the big five was first invented,

31
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,400
invented or discovered,
depending on how you look at it,

32
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,620
as I mentioned briefly as well,
it was brute force statistics basically.

33
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,950
So the idea behind the big five is that 
the,

34
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:09,951
uh,
it's called the lexical hypothesis 

35
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:12,750
hypothesis is that because human traits 
are so important to us because we want 

36
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:16,860
to understand ourselves and perhaps even
more importantly,

37
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:20,520
we want to understand other people and 
because we have language,

38
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,150
there's a reasonable probability that 
we've encapsulated the structure of 

39
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,480
human personality within our language.

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,500
And so if you analyze the linguistic 
representations properly,

41
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:37,590
then perhaps you can extract out the 
central personality features.

42
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,310
And that's basically what the lexical 
hypothesis is and it's important to know

43
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:46,311
the lexical hypothesis and it's a bit 
more sophisticated than that because it 

44
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:52,911
basically presumed that you can extract 
out route valid information about 

45
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:57,141
personality from adjectives,
descriptive adjectives from phrases and 

46
00:02:57,141 --> 00:03:01,761
from questions,
and you'll get the same basic 

47
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:04,810
dimensional structure regardless of 
which of those techniques you use.

48
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:09,370
And that turns out to be true for all 
intents and purposes.

49
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Now,
the lexical hypothesis depends on its 

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,351
validity,
depends for its validity on the initial 

51
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:22,681
claim,
that personality is accurately 

52
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:22,681
represented within the structure of 
language.

53
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:27,061
And so one of the things I would say is 
that there is a week paid five 

54
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:30,310
hypothesis and a strong big five 
hypothesis.

55
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:35,311
Okay?
The week big five hypothesis is that in 

56
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:37,900
so far as you use language to describe 
personality,

57
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,950
personality has a five factor structure 
that's reliably extractable.

58
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,110
Now,
the strong,

59
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:49,111
Big Five theory is that no,
no personality has a five factor 

60
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,500
structure and it's accurately 
represented in language,

61
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,780
but when you pull out the structure from
language,

62
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:57,610
what you're pulling out is actually 
representative of genuine personality.

63
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,750
Now the week hypothesis is I would say 
it's established and it's worth knowing 

64
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,800
because what it,
what it means is that if you invent a 

65
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,400
questionnaire that has anything to do 
with self description,

66
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:15,610
it might be self description at multiple
different levels of analysis,

67
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,660
like values for example,
and instead of just adjectives or 

68
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,190
attitudes instead of just adjectives.
I mean these categories are sort of of a

69
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,800
unclear.
What's the difference between your 

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:31,800
attitude and your temperament?
Well,

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,720
you know,
it's usually defined by the sentence 

72
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:35,720
that you used the word Zen,
right?

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,760
You extract out the words,
they sort of stand there alone.

74
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,790
They don't.
It's very difficult to clarify their 

75
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,790
meaning.

76
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,360
Anyways.
The lexical hypothesis I think is one of

77
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:51,361
the most well established.
It's one of the most well validated 

78
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:56,761
claims in psychology.
I think it might be the most validated 

79
00:04:56,761 --> 00:05:00,541
claim apart from maybe the work that is 
extracted Iq out from cognitive 

80
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,820
questions.
And uh,

81
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,360
basically it was brute force statistics.
You know,

82
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:12,361
people develop different lists of 
adjectives and you can complain in some 

83
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:14,110
ways about how they did it and we'll 
talk about that later.

84
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,550
But because they tried to throw out the 
evaluative words like good and evil,

85
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,470
for example,
those aren't in the big five.

86
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,850
So they tried to only use adjectives 
that didn't necessarily seem to be like 

87
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,300
highly or valued or devalued.
So introvert and extrovert,

88
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
while they're opposites,
but you know,

89
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,340
is it better to be an introvert?
It's better to be the extroverts like,

90
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,680
well,
it's not obvious.

91
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:43,681
So those were all the words that cover 
that dimension can be kept in because 

92
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:45,400
there's no value judgements associated 
with it.

93
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,400
And the originators of the big five 
theory wanted to keep it as free of 

94
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,050
values as possible.
Now that's already a hypothesis,

95
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:58,051
right?
It's a hypothesis that you can come up 

96
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:58,051
with an accurate description of human 
personality,

97
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,110
even if you eliminate all the words that
have to do that are clearly vacancy.

98
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,750
And uh,
we did an experiment here a while back,

99
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:10,610
that was pretty interesting.
We got hold of a data set of descriptive

100
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,220
adjectives and we put all the evaluative
words back in,

101
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,550
so,
you know,

102
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:18,920
like nasty and horrible and awkward and 
a pool.

103
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:22,130
And um,
and then the good words as well,

104
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,120
you know,
moral,

105
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,500
pleasant,
uplifting all of those things and,

106
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,910
and we had people rate people they liked
and people they didn't like using that 

107
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,350
expanded list and we got a real 
archetype in some sense of the hateable 

108
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,290
person and a tremendous number of the 
words that were used came from the value

109
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,040
of dementia.

110
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,830
So I think that when you throw out the 
value of words,

111
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:47,510
you actually throw out a lot of what 
people actually use descriptive words to

112
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:52,511
describe because you know,
when you like someone or don't like 

113
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:53,000
someone if someone's likable or 
unlikable,

114
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:56,470
that's pretty important phenomena.
You know what I mean?

115
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,290
You hang around the people you like 
generally speaking and you don't 

116
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:02,290
associate with the people you don't 
like.

117
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,461
So it's a fundamental choice,
but we'll talk about that later because 

118
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,500
there's reasons that happened and the 
reasons were valid and it's not that 

119
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,220
easy to fix it.
And besides that,

120
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,890
the standard five factor model has all 
sorts of utility.

121
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,400
So,
but you need to know what its strengths 

122
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:21,590
are and it's limitations are now 
hypothetically,

123
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:26,591
what you knew to draw out the five 
factor model is you take magine the sec 

124
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:30,761
of all descriptive adjectives and then 
you take a random sample of those 

125
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:34,190
descriptive adjectives so that it's not 
biased.

126
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,680
You don't use all of them because you 
know,

127
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:41,681
if you ask someone to describe 
themselves on a questionnaire using all 

128
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:42,950
the adjectives we have that described 
personality,

129
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,890
they'd be there for a day.
And so that's not very efficient.

130
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,990
So you want to take a random sample,
maybe you only sample the words that 

131
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,790
people are most likely to use.
So for example,

132
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,880
if you go online and you'll find that 
there are word frequency tables,

133
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,640
you know,
and most of your language,

134
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,760
most of the,
about 500 words covers about 80 percent 

135
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,280
of what you say.
So,

136
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,400
you know,
and I don't remember what the lexicon of

137
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:12,401
the typical person is.
I think it's in the neighborhood of 

138
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:12,830
3,500
words,

139
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:16,220
but that might be wrong,
but there's like 750,000

140
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,690
words in the English language.
You know,

141
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,740
it's an omnivorous language,
it just pulled words in from all over 

142
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,050
and so you hardly use any of those words
you know,

143
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,950
and there's ones that are used 
extraordinarily infrequently.

144
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:33,250
So what you could do is you could look 
at the total set of adjectives and then 

145
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,310
you can pull out,
you know,

146
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:36,590
identify the ones,
the ones that are used,

147
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,620
you know,
the thousand most frequently used words 

148
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,201
and that probably covered 95 percent of 
the territory and then you could pick 

149
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:47,141
out random set of a hundred and you 
could administer it to people and then 

150
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:47,630
you could factor,
analyze it,

151
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,250
administered to lots of people.
Then you factor analyze it and you get 

152
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,500
five relatively clear and stable factors
and the most,

153
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,490
the one that comes out first,
so it's,

154
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:03,491
it's the dominant factor in some sense 
or the easiest to measure are maybe the 

155
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:04,860
best represented language or something 
like that.

156
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:09,861
It's extroversion versus introversion 
and extroversion is a positive emotion 

157
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:16,371
dimension and it's associated with 
enthusiasm and assertiveness and 

158
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,250
assertive people will say they'll 
dominate the conversation with language 

159
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,290
or they'll well that basically that's 
the right way to think about it.

160
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm enthusiastic people,
they're up for anything,

161
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,960
you know,
they're the ones that are always smiling

162
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:35,110
and telling jokes and having parties and
that sort of thing.

163
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:39,210
And generally extroverts really liked to
be around people so they're happy.

164
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,980
They're gregarious,
they're assertive,

165
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,380
they're enthusiastic,
they're noisy,

166
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,470
they blink more than introverts out.
Why that is.

167
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,300
I have no idea,
but apparently they do.

168
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,880
So if you notice something blinking a 
lot,

169
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,440
you can assume that they're extroverts.

170
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,750
If they're not conscientious,
like you know,

171
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:59,730
there's this idea of people being 
impulsive.

172
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:04,731
It's very badly defined term.
So when you hear a psychologist talking 

173
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:07,731
about impulsivity,
the first thing you could realize is 

174
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:10,641
they don't know.
You don't know what the hell they're 

175
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:11,190
talking about because probably there's 
no such thing as impulsivity,

176
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,170
but extroverted people who are not very 
conscientious tend to.

177
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,850
That's one of the things that you might 
think about as associated with 

178
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:22,980
impulsivity.
There's all sorts of other things though

179
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:23,610
too,
so,

180
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,350
um,
okay,

181
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:30,351
so there a positive emotion dimension 
and that's extroversion and there's a 

182
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:30,351
negative emotion,
emotion,

183
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:32,610
dimension and that's neuroticism and 
neurotic.

184
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,540
Neuroticism seems to break down into 
something like withdrawal and volatility

185
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
and volatile people are touching so you 
know,

186
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,690
they'll,
they'll react quite a lot if something 

187
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:44,690
negative happens.
So if you tease them,

188
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,661
they might get upset or if you start 
fighting with them and that sort of 

189
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,010
provocative way instead of sort of 
calming everything down there,

190
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,210
just ramp it up.

191
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,480
And if there's two of you that are 
volatile and you're having a 

192
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,520
conversation and the conversation goes a
little bit,

193
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,440
you know,
into unpleasant territory,

194
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,980
you can really get each other going.
So yes,

195
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,390
like in terms of the hero and I can turn
those states both.

196
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
Oh,
both.

197
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,350
Yeah.
I mean that's part of the problem with 

198
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,800
using the word emotion because there's 
an emotion,

199
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:17,801
an internal state or a set of behaviors.
And the answer to that as far as we can 

200
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:17,801
tell,
it's both.

201
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:22,580
So now I'm going to start talking about 
extroversion and neuroticism.

202
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,750
And part of the reason for that is 
because I think the evidence for the 

203
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,030
relationship between those traits and 
the way the brain functions functions is

204
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:38,031
in some sense the clearest.
Now you remember the baby five were 

205
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,630
extracted out using statistical 
procedures,

206
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:44,631
right?
So there's no reason to assume 

207
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:46,701
necessarily that the traits would bear 
any straightforward relationship to 

208
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:49,530
brain function because they didn't.

209
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,930
They weren't derived from analysis of 
brain function,

210
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,230
at least not directly they were at.
They were extracted from analysis of 

211
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,340
linguistic representations of other 
peoples and your own behavior.

212
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,790
But it turns out that there's quite a 
concordance between certain elements of 

213
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,621
neuro psychological theory and the 
positive and negative emotional traits,

214
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,040
extroversion and neuroticism.
And so what I'm going to do today is I'm

215
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,570
gonna.
I'm gonna.

216
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,630
I'm gonna.
Talk to you about how positive and 

217
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,851
negative emotions are are instantiated 
in some sense neurologically.

218
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,610
But I'm going to put that in a,
in a broader picture of brain function.

219
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:33,220
Because while,
because first of all,

220
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,450
why not?
And second,

221
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:37,780
because a lot of the things I'm going to
tell you about the brain today will sort

222
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:41,770
of retroactively shed light on some of 
the clinical theories that we've already

223
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,300
talked about.
So,

224
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,160
so which is nice,
you know,

225
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:48,520
because when one of the ways that you 
find out if something is true,

226
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:51,100
and this is something we also talked 
about during the last lecture,

227
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:56,101
is that it manifests itself even when 
you use different measurement 

228
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:57,160
techniques.

229
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,810
And so you had this statistical 
derivation which basically took place.

230
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,870
It really started to accelerate,
I would say first in the 19 sixties and 

231
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,530
then in the 19 eighties it made a big 
comeback in the 19 eighties,

232
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,950
but paralleling that were theories of 
brain development and they weren't 

233
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,431
really the scientists that were doing 
the one sort of research really work 

234
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,000
communicating with the scientists that 
were doing the other kind of research.

235
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,600
So they were methodologically separate.
They use different techniques as well.

236
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,790
They weren't talking back and forth much
and they were using different 

237
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,531
measurement techniques.
So if they both come up with the same 

238
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:31,531
thing,
then you think,

239
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:35,701
oh,
well there's probably something to that 

240
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:36,510
because you know,
for the sighted people discovered it and

241
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:39,640
the people who could hear discovered it.
It's the same kind of idea.

242
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,430
So,
and you know,

243
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:47,431
this has been worked out in a fair bit 
of detail over the last 30 years really.

244
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,600
And so,
um,

245
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,340
the,
the papers that you're supposed to read 

246
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,340
with their difficult papers,
uh,

247
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,920
I believe you're reading gray,
which is a model of the limbic system 

248
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,430
and Basal Ganglia applications to 
anxiety and schizophrenia.

249
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,080
Um,
um,

250
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,320
I think you have goals and behavior.
That's the carbon shyer paper.

251
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,690
I put the Swanson paper in as optional.
That's cerebral hemisphere regulation of

252
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:16,210
motivated behavior.
That is a tough paper.

253
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,900
And so is the gray paper and it's partly
because of these guys,

254
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,840
both of them graze paper is that is a 
distillation of a very,

255
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:28,090
very thick book that's very,
very difficult.

256
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:33,091
And that's been written twice.
It was published first in 1982 and then 

257
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:33,970
again in 1999.
It's a brilliant book.

258
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,550
It's had a tremendous impact on 
psychology.

259
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,820
Gray was one of those people who,
he was so damn smart.

260
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,080
It's just painful,
you know,

261
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:46,081
I mean his reference list,
I don't know how many papers are in his 

262
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:46,090
reference list,
like 2000.

263
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,240
And one of the really weird things about
gray that makes them stand out among 

264
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,790
scientists is he actually read all those
and more than that,

265
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,910
he understood them.
And so that's really something.

266
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:59,600
And so greatest book on anxiety.
Um,

267
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,410
he's,
he,

268
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,100
he did a lot of work with animal 
behavior.

269
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,290
I'll tell you if you want like solid 
psychological information about how the 

270
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:10,760
brain works.
The people that you pay attention to are

271
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:12,670
the animal,
the,

272
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,340
the people who are studying animal 
behavior and animal grades.

273
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,490
They know what they're doing there.
So methodologically careful.

274
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:24,491
They're very,
very reliable and the human neuro 

275
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:25,490
psychologists and the people who use pet
standards and Mris and all that thing.

276
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,840
There are way,
way,

277
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:31,841
way behind the animal researchers 
because the animal researchers can just 

278
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:35,411
get in there at a lot higher resolution 
and they can do much more stringent 

279
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:37,370
experiments and they tend to be more 
methodological,

280
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,440
careful and more scientifically minded.

281
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,350
So anyways,
the gradebook is a brilliant book.

282
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:44,750
It's very.
It took me like four months to read that

283
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:49,490
damn book and I was.
I really had to take it apart because he

284
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,640
probably had 30 years of work into it,
something like that.

285
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:56,440
And like he worked a lot in 30 years,
you know,

286
00:15:56,441 --> 00:16:01,441
he did a lot of experimentation and he 
read lot and so he built a bottle of 

287
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:04,721
the,
of the brain's function that was based 

288
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:06,260
on partly on Russian neuropsychology,
partly on cybernetic theory,

289
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,090
hardly on animal behavior,
partly on neuropsychopharmacology.

290
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:16,091
And so that's the study of how drugs 
affect behavior and cognition and then 

291
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:19,790
partly partly from a higher order 
conceptual perspective.

292
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:24,791
And then he stacked all those things up,
one on top of the other to make sure 

293
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,540
that the picture was the same at every 
single level of analysis.

294
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,070
It's absolutely brilliant work.

295
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,070
And it took the social psychologist,
like they really started thinking about 

296
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,790
gray,
although he published his book in 1982,

297
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,600
they probably started thinking about the
great seriously in about 2005,

298
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,930
so it took 23 years for his book to 
start to make its widescale entrance 

299
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,150
into the more general psychological 
community.

300
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:51,140
And anyways,
and so you're going to read this paper,

301
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,370
which is a model of the limbic system 
and Basal Ganglia and it's a distillery.

302
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:00,430
It's 30 years,
were distilled into the book and then 

303
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:00,640
that was distilled into this paper.
So you know,

304
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,530
it's rough going.
And then the Swanson paper,

305
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,540
he's another guy,
same kind of guy.

306
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:10,570
He's a developmental neuro anatomist.
And if you're really interested in 

307
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:15,221
psychology,
I would really recommend reading those 

308
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:16,070
papers because like they're hard going.
But if you get it,

309
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,960
you have this substrata of knowledge 
underneath you that's really firmed.

310
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,080
And I rated like Swanson's paper.
The guy's a genius.

311
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:29,081
And what's so cool about Swanson's paper
is that if you talked to human neuro 

312
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:33,581
psychologists,
you'll find that they're biased towards 

313
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:33,860
the cerebral cortex.
And there's sort of.

314
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,890
I think there's sort of an 
anthropomorphic pride that goes along 

315
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:38,890
with that.
It's like,

316
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,350
well,
how are we different from animals?

317
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:39,770
Well,
you know,

318
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:43,490
we've got thumbs and not great,
hooray for the thumbs and you stand up,

319
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:43,880
right?
And,

320
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,120
but if you look at us neurologically,
the big differences that we have this 

321
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,180
tremendously expanded cerebral cortex,
especially the prefrontal cortex.

322
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:53,100
And so then people think,
well,

323
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:58,101
because you know,
that's one of the things that 

324
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:00,201
differentiates us from animals and it's 
relatively evolutionarily modern because

325
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:04,170
the human brain really,
really developed rapidly over the last 2

326
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,250
million years that it's like king of the
brain in some sense,

327
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,730
and it's the place where all the 
complicated things happen and that's 

328
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:13,730
just not right.

329
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,500
Because like breathing,
that's complicated.

330
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,830
That's why you don't get to control it 
voluntarily and keeping your heart 

331
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,560
going.
That's complicated too.

332
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,720
And so you don't get to have a decision 
about that.

333
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,750
Your brain has made that automatic like 
millions of years ago because there's 

334
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:34,941
just no way you're going to get 
voluntary control over something that's 

335
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:34,941
that vital,
you know?

336
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:39,651
So assuming that newer brain areas do 
more complex things is in some ways I 

337
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,750
think that's actually precisely 
backwards.

338
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:46,530
It's the old brain areas that have been 
around for 100,

339
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,940
$100,
million years.

340
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:52,710
Those damn things are smart and that's 
why they've survived for so long and why

341
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:55,170
they're distributed and into so many 
different species.

342
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:56,490
You know,
like you,

343
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,460
your brain is somewhat like a lobster's 
brain.

344
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,640
It's a lot like a mouse brain and it's a
lot like a rat brain and you might 

345
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,931
think,
well the rapper and isn't a very good 

346
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:08,931
model of a human brain because after all
their rats.

347
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:13,640
But one thing I can tell you is that a 
rat brain is a way better model of a 

348
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,271
human brain.
Then your model of a human brain is a 

349
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:18,030
model of the human brain.
You know what I mean?

350
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,600
It's like people think of the brain 
while they have a dopey model.

351
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,490
Using Iraq as an example,
of course it's,

352
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,390
it's often some ways because rats can't 
talk for example,

353
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,850
but there are so many levels of analysis
where you.

354
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:33,780
You might as well be a wrap,
you know,

355
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,540
technically speaking,
that neuropharmacology,

356
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,470
for example,
it's very,

357
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,350
very similar.
The function of the neurotransmitters,

358
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,470
the basic anatomy of the structures,
like there's a tremendous amount of 

359
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,660
overlap and so you might as well go for 
the commonalities among brains before 

360
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:54,510
you focusing on the differences because 
in some sense that way you get the basic

361
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:59,511
architecture right now.
Now one of the things that's really 

362
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:02,811
interesting about Swanson and this makes
him and he's not a neuropsychologist and

363
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,590
he's not really even a psychologist.

364
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,370
He's a developmental neuro anatomist and
so there's lots of ways of piecing of 

365
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,000
chopping up the brain,
you know,

366
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,310
to look at it because it's a really 
complicated thing.

367
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,120
It's like saying,
well,

368
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:18,150
how many ways can you divide up a city 
to analyze it?

369
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,060
Well,
there's,

370
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,240
there's endless numbers of ways that you
can divide up the city to look at it.

371
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,430
And there's.
It's the same with the brain,

372
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:31,510
you know,
because it's infinitely subdivided will 

373
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,030
in some sense,
certainly all the way down to the 

374
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,490
molecular structures.
And then even at higher order levels,

375
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,760
you know,
because it's so complex and it's 

376
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,861
hierarchically structured,
you can just divide it up in all sorts 

377
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:46,011
of different ways.
And so at higher levels of resolution 

378
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,040
there isn't even that much agreement on 
how to name the parts.

379
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,580
Now what the developmental 
neuroanatomists do is that they look at 

380
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,590
how the brain develops in uteral over 
time.

381
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,750
So because it's a developing thing that 
sort of unfold like a flower unfold,

382
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,900
you know,
and you can track how the,

383
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,280
you know,
which part of the early brain turns into

384
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:09,281
the later braid.
And so you can get some sense of the 

385
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:10,330
like,
it's like an evolutionary tree,

386
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:15,331
you know,
if these three parts grew out of this 

387
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:17,971
part,
then you can assume that there's some 

388
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:19,771
commonality between them.
And that can also help you figure out 

389
00:21:19,771 --> 00:21:22,651
how to divide up the brain.
And so that's one of the things that 

390
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:22,651
Swanson does.
But the other thing he does,

391
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:27,541
which I really liked,
is that instead of looking at the brain 

392
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,200
from the top down,
which is what human psychologist tend to

393
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:31,480
do because they concentrate on st 
language.

394
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:34,540
And you know,
higher order cognitive functions,

395
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,960
which we think of as complex,
but you think they're not that damn 

396
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:39,960
complex,
you know,

397
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,920
like a computer can do mathematics so 
much better than you that there's not 

398
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,660
even any comparison,
you know,

399
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,480
and it won't be very long before.

400
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,960
A lot of the things that we think of as 
abstract cognition are things that 

401
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,600
computers are going to be able to do,
right?

402
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:54,820
They just want to go tournament for 
example,

403
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:00,150
and the computers are now better.
Even your pc is better at playing chess 

404
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,561
than probably anyone in this room.
And the really high end computers are 

405
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:08,281
better at playing chess that anyone who,
who lives and so computers are catching 

406
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:12,541
up damn fast,
but you'll notice that they don't do 

407
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,720
things like bus tables in restaurants 
because it turns out that's really hard.

408
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,940
You know,
when you think about it,

409
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:16,780
it's hard.
You know,

410
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:18,940
you're carrying different size loads all
the time.

411
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,000
You have to interact socially with 
people properly.

412
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,830
You have to stay the hell out of the 
way.

413
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,950
You have to exactly time when you're 
going to come to the table,

414
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,490
you know you have to,
you have to move extraordinarily 

415
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:32,490
efficiently,
especially as the place gets busy,

416
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,650
you know,
there's a lot of demands on you to do 

417
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,290
that job effectively and you know,
we think about it as a low end job,

418
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,300
but it's not automated.

419
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,980
The low end jobs are the ones that are 
going to be automated first and it's not

420
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:50,070
obvious that they're going to be the 
things that we associated with low end 

421
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,070
labor,
you know,

422
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,840
it's just the,
well now Swanson's did with the nervous 

423
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,040
system.
I,

424
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,260
I was so happy when I found this paper 
because he did exactly what the nervous 

425
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,750
system,
what piaget did with children.

426
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,200
He showed how the nervous system builds 
self from the bottom up and so swanson 

427
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,060
and lays right on top of piaget.
It's lovely.

428
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,970
And then the other thing that's wants 
and does very,

429
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:17,350
very nicely as the elucidates a lot of 
the Freudian presuppositions,

430
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,100
you know,
so Freud of course talk about the ID and

431
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:24,940
the ID is this sort of like the archaic 
brain in some sense.

432
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:25,420
You know,
it's all,

433
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:28,940
we're all your primal impulses alert and
you know,

434
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,050
he called that one thing that in while 
you might say,

435
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:33,580
well,
is there an IED in the brain?

436
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,580
And the answer is well,
vaguely vaguely the,

437
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,470
the brain does differ in terms of the,
of the age of it's sub components and as

438
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,520
you go deeper into the brain and closer 
to the spine,

439
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,940
the brain areas get find a genetically 
older and the more phylogenetically 

440
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,750
genetically older areas of the brain 
which are underneath the cortex.

441
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,420
They have their own little circuits,
you know,

442
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,530
and there's some commonality between 
them and they do govern tribal.

443
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,650
I think of them as primal 
subpersonalities.

444
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,630
It's,
and we've talked about that before.

445
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:13,631
It's better than thinking about them as 
drives or goals or anything like that 

446
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:17,540
because not only do they do they do,
they,

447
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,300
they're,
they're sets of associated behaviors,

448
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,390
but they're not just that.
There are also ways of looking at the 

449
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:25,700
world and ways of thinking about the 
world.

450
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,100
So you know,
if you're angry,

451
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,880
it's not like you're,
you're being driven to use your fists.

452
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,880
That's not how it works.
What happens is that the angry 

453
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:36,880
subpersonality comes out,
you know,

454
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,050
and it does a whole bunch of things,
you know,

455
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:44,051
it's got its own state of arousal.
It's characterized both by positive and 

456
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:45,680
negative emotion,
which is something that's quite peculiar

457
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:50,681
about anger because it's both a 
defensive reaction and an aggressive 

458
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:54,590
forward moving behavior and it has a 
viewpoint like it's a biased viewpoint.

459
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:59,591
If you're angry with someone,
all you can see about them is how damn 

460
00:24:59,591 --> 00:25:00,530
irritating they are and how much they 
need to be defeated,

461
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,790
you know,
roughly speaking.

462
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,670
And so it's a whole personality.
Now.

463
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:07,280
It's a one dimensional personality has 
all.

464
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:11,720
It's really God is anger and that's not 
enough to solve every problem,

465
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:17,170
but you can't think about it as a drive 
exactly because it's also because it's 

466
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:17,840
not deterministic,
you know,

467
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:21,920
it's even when you're angry,
you have a range of choices to make.

468
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,560
Now there are circumscribed by the fact 
that you're angry,

469
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,120
you know,
but,

470
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,570
but it's best to think about it as a sub
personality.

471
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,340
I think you just get a lot farther that 
way.

472
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:36,020
Now what Swanson did,
you know how Psj talked about children,

473
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,080
infants,
they start out with a few fundamental 

474
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,080
reflexes,
right?

475
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,950
That they're sort of born with,
including the ability to use their mouth

476
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:47,951
and they're telling me as an exploratory
a device and then they have certain 

477
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:53,201
reflexes that they can manifest right 
away and then they have the ability to 

478
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:55,250
modify those reflexes and so as far as 
piaget was concerned,

479
00:25:55,251 --> 00:26:00,251
that was enough to get the ball rolling.
It was sorta like the child was booting 

480
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:00,980
up across time.
It's got some,

481
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,320
you know,
outside of the operating system,

482
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:08,321
you've got some bare processes in your 
computer that get it started enough so 

483
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:09,620
the operating system can turn on.

484
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,080
It sort of unfolds up into something 
complex.

485
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,320
Well,
that's sort of what human beings do 

486
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,320
across time.
They start out with these basic reflexes

487
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,630
that are simple movements and then they 
learn how to modify the movements and 

488
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,961
then they learn how to chain the 
movements together and then they learn 

489
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,931
how to use the chain movements as tools 
in some sense as embodied tools to 

490
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:34,571
pursue to to allow these biologically 
determined subpersonalities to operate 

491
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:38,120
in the world with some chance of 
success.

492
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,370
Okay,
now,

493
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:44,371
and you can,
you can layer that onto the nervous 

494
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:44,371
system,
so partly what's happening when you get,

495
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:47,310
when you get these basic movements down,
the ones that are now automatic,

496
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:52,311
like your ability to grip and your 
ability to do this with your hands and 

497
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:54,270
all the.
All the basic sub routines you have with

498
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:56,760
your body.
Those are automatized.

499
00:26:56,761 --> 00:27:01,761
They're.
They're made into little machines and 

500
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:03,240
lot of them run spinal,
so you know because what you think in 

501
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,821
some sense is that if you're walking,
you're thinking about walking in some 

502
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:07,821
way.

503
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:07,950
That's how you walk.
It's like,

504
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:11,180
that's not right.
What happens is you orient yourself to a

505
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,190
goal and in some sense you just 
disinhibit the system that knows how to 

506
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,770
walk and then it more or less does it 
automatically and you know you direct it

507
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:22,590
and you can modify what it's doing if 
there's an error,

508
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,180
but you kind of know that,
right?

509
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:26,970
You drive to school or you drive 
somewhere you're familiar to.

510
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,360
You don't even even necessarily remember
the drive.

511
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:35,361
If you've done it 50 times,
it's because you're basically in some 

512
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:39,381
sense you just sequencing automated 
behaviors and are good thing too because

513
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:42,780
if you didn't have those automated 
expert behaviors at hand,

514
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,840
you wouldn't know how to drive because 
it's.

515
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,500
You're just not smart.
You know the time when you drive most 

516
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,800
consciously is when you first learned 
how to drive.

517
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,590
Well,
you don't want a conscious thriver.

518
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,040
You want an unconscious expert driver 
whose consciousness is monitoring the 

519
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,000
world for anything unexpected.
That's what you want.

520
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,480
So,
and that's the case for almost 

521
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,831
everything you do.
If you have to become conscious of what 

522
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:13,191
you're doing,
the probability that you don't do it 

523
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:13,191
very well,
it's really high.

524
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,700
And you know that because maybe you're 
talking to someone happens when I'm 

525
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,001
lecturing,
sometimes if I'm not really on top of 

526
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:22,551
things,
I'll get self conscious and that's a 

527
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:22,551
terrible thing to have happened when you
lecture,

528
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:23,220
you know,
it just makes you stumble.

529
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,520
If it's going well,
I know where I'm going and I'd have all 

530
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:28,520
these little routines,
you know,

531
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,890
that our stories and things that I know 
that they just automatically sequence.

532
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:36,150
All I have to do is point the lecture in
the right direction and you know,

533
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,520
the things that are logically associated
with,

534
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:39,330
uh,
with,

535
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,240
uh,
the direction of the lecture will,

536
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,540
they'll come up there,
they're primed in some sense.

537
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,840
And so Swanson helped me understand the 
functions of the lower part of the brain

538
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:54,410
quite well.
And then to map that onto piaget and l,

539
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,480
one of the things he helped me 
understand was just exactly how 

540
00:28:59,480 --> 00:28:59,970
sophisticated the lower parts of the 
brain are.

541
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:04,971
The more automatic parts.
Now the behaviorists used to believe 

542
00:29:04,971 --> 00:29:06,990
that or did believe and still believe to
some degree,

543
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:09,960
that a lot of your behavior is 
reflexive.

544
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,260
And the radical behavior is the guys 
from the fifties,

545
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:18,530
but more or less made the case that even
complex behavior among animals is 

546
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,030
nothing but the chaining together a 
automatic reflexes.

547
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,630
So it was deterministic chain of of 
reflexes.

548
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,480
Well,
you do have reflex actions,

549
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,670
you know,
so if you touch a hot stove,

550
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:32,880
you'll jerk your hand away and your 
brain isn't involved in that.

551
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,980
It's just your spinal cord that's 
involved in that.

552
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,950
Now your brain's involved when the pain 
hits.

553
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,740
And maybe that's so that you stopped 
doing it in the future,

554
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:46,050
but you're the conscious part of your 
brain is too slow to get your hand away 

555
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,690
from the,
from the stove in time.

556
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,400
And so what's happening in your body in 
some senses that you have these multiple

557
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:56,120
layers of neurological organization and 
some of them are quite fixed there.

558
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,470
Their automatic deterministic systems 
and those are things you really,

559
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,980
really practiced and that you can just 
run as a routine.

560
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:08,370
And then above that are the.
Are those things that you've chained 

561
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:08,830
together but they could be chained 
together in different ways.

562
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,710
So they're less automatized and then you
keep going up.

563
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,740
They get more and more complex and less 
automatized until out the top,

564
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,270
which is where your consciousness is 
roughly speaking,

565
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,060
your,
you have to program what you're doing,

566
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:27,350
you know,
and you have to pay very careful 

567
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,480
attention to how to go about doing this 
because you don't have the systems built

568
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:30,910
into you.
So know what that's like.

569
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:35,911
If you're trying to learn something new,
it takes a lot of energy and you really 

570
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:35,911
have to pay attention,
pay attention,

571
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,440
and then once you start to get it,
you know,

572
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,990
well,
there's things.

573
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,350
What really happens is those things you 
don't have to think about anymore.

574
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,050
And thank God for that because you know,
first of all,

575
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:52,051
you can't think that much because you're
a pretty limited capacity process or in 

576
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:54,310
second,
the programming is quite difficult.

577
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,780
Okay,
so,

578
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,310
so let,
let's see here what I've got.

579
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,480
Yeah,
that's what.

580
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,320
Okay,
so if you look on the right there,

581
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,800
there's a little diagram that's a 
hierarchical guy or a little table 

582
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,370
really,
and it's talking about the motor system.

583
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Now the motor system is what allows you 
to put action and like you're out 

584
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,530
putting action at all sorts of levels 
that you don't even realize because you 

585
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,841
know,
you might think that that site is a 

586
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:46,841
sensory activity,
for example,

587
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:50,420
but that there's a very tight 
relationship between sensory activity in

588
00:31:50,421 --> 00:31:52,070
motor activity.
So for example,

589
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,340
when you're looking at a scene,
even though you don't know what your 

590
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,771
eyes are going like this,
and the reason they're going like that 

591
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:02,951
is because if you held your eyes 
absolutely still and you can actually 

592
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:03,790
learn to do this,
if you hold your eyes absolutely still,

593
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,050
your visual fade right out and you won't
see anything.

594
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,270
And because of the little,
the little,

595
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:13,271
uh,
retinal cells that are picking up the 

596
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:13,271
light get exhausted.

597
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:15,150
And so then they stopped transmitting.
And so part of the reason you're zipping

598
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,510
your eyes back and forth is so that,
you know,

599
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:21,530
different parts of your I can process 
the scene and it doesn't get exhausted.

600
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,320
And plus you're also looking around,
you know,

601
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:29,321
and you're looking at when things move,
when you direct your attention to that 

602
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:33,131
or if someone makes a gesture and so 
you're actually kind of using your eyes 

603
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:34,030
like tentacles you know,
to,

604
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,580
to,
to check out the,

605
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,710
the,
the information that's coded in the 

606
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,150
light even when you're here and that 
sort of thing.

607
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:43,430
There's a fair bit of motor activity 
associated with it.

608
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,460
You turn your head unconsciously and 
there's all sorts of little motor 

609
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,010
actions in your ear that also helps you 
tune in.

610
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:51,140
And so those things are tightly 
associated.

611
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,730
But roughly speaking,
the motor output is action.

612
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,720
And then Swanson shows that there are 
these layers in the nervous system that 

613
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:04,250
go from the spinal cord upward.

614
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:10,030
The first ones are the somatic motor 
neuron pools and the second are 

615
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,880
locomotor pattern generators in the 
third,

616
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:15,881
our local motor pattern initiators.
And then the fourth r locomotor pattern 

617
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:18,110
controllers.
It's a hierarchy.

618
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:21,580
So the way to kind of lay piaget on it 
in some senses,

619
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,590
to think of the somatic motor neuron 
pools as simple actions that can be 

620
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:33,290
implemented automatically.
And then the locomotor pattern generator

621
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:38,291
has taken those simple actions and chain
them into relatively more complex 

622
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:44,021
melodies of action.
So kinetic melodies and then the 

623
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:48,821
locomotor pattern initiator,
more or less decides windows kinetic 

624
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:50,990
melodies should be implemented and even 
that can be unconscious.

625
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,890
And then so it's still at that level of 
brain organization.

626
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:57,750
It's still more or less automatic even 
stimulus response.

627
00:33:57,751 --> 00:34:02,751
There's a way to think about it.
And then you go one level higher and 

628
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:05,630
that's where you get the ability to 
voluntarily use these automated things.

629
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,090
So I can show you an example of how this
works.

630
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:13,091
So this is called a ballistic movement.
So I'm going to take my hand and I'm 

631
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:16,520
going to bring it down really fast,
right towards that itch.

632
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,490
Okay.
So all right.

633
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,440
Now.
So that's very fast movement.

634
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,900
Now,
one of the things that's cool about that

635
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:28,790
movement is that I don't have time.
Once that action starts,

636
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,690
it happened so fast that it's done by 
the time the,

637
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,560
the information about the action 
actually gets to my brain.

638
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,740
So I actually,
once I let that go,

639
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:45,490
I can't control it.
What I basically am doing is 

640
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:50,110
disinhibiting the motor control systems 
that are already have established in my 

641
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:56,140
psychophysiological being.
I'm disinhibiting one of those and then 

642
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,630
it runs automatically and so that's what
you're doing all the time when you're,

643
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:03,740
when you're acting in life and it's kind
of a neat.

644
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,420
I wrote a paper a while back with an 
undergraduate student divine who's who,

645
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,660
so he was a pretty break character and 
we got invited to do a paper.

646
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:16,280
I got invited to do a paper on free will
and so we were thinking about free will,

647
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,920
you know,
and it's very interesting to think about

648
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:22,220
freewill in relationship to these 
hierarchies because it sort of goes like

649
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:27,221
this.
Is that out there in the future you've 

650
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:31,061
got free will,
but as the future moves towards the 

651
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:31,130
present,
you don't like.

652
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,870
Once it gets close enough to the 
present,

653
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,020
you have to have initiated something 
automatic.

654
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,820
That will happen.
And so I can give you an example.

655
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,500
People who play the piano very well,
they look ahead of where they're playing

656
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,150
in the music because they know how to do
this.

657
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:53,151
They don't have to think about it.
What they have to do is look ahead so 

658
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:53,640
that the part of them that knows how to 
do this gets ready to do it,

659
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,950
and all of you are experts in that way.

660
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,950
Likely all of those of you who drive,
you're also experts that way because 

661
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,980
when you're driving,
where do you look?

662
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,700
If you're a good driver on the highway,
you looked like at least half a second 

663
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,400
or a second ahead.
Why?

664
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,910
Well,
because 50 feet ahead has already 

665
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:13,910
happened,
right?

666
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,630
It's too close in time for you to do 
anything about it.

667
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:20,631
So basically what you're doing is you're
looking at the road and then you're 

668
00:36:20,631 --> 00:36:24,890
disinhibiting sequences of action that 
are the ones that are going to 

669
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,120
correspond to what you want to do with 
the road most,

670
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,850
most adequately.
And as you know,

671
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,820
the closer you get to executing one of 
those motor behaviors,

672
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:36,750
the more automated automated it is.
So by the time you manifest the auction,

673
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,270
there's no free will there at all,
but you are.

674
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:41,850
You said enough to be released in some 
sense.

675
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,230
So I could say,
well,

676
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,250
this isn't.

677
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,280
There's no free will in that,
but there was in deciding to do it at 

678
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,751
that point,
so and so that's sort of how your auto 

679
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:55,930
automative city meets your freedom,
you know,

680
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,260
gotta think about it as something 
extending across time.

681
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,600
So,
okay,

682
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:05,460
so having established that,
then we're going to get into the,

683
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,410
the,
uh,

684
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:13,130
the more,
the neurological localization a little 

685
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,580
bit.
So you might say,

686
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,360
well you collect all these patterns of 
behavior and then you automate them into

687
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,520
routines.
I could give you an example.

688
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:23,130
So for a child,
you know when a child first comes,

689
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,580
when a child is first born,
if you tap on his cheek,

690
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:28,950
it will go like this.
It's called a rooting reflex and it will

691
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:32,910
move its mouth and tongue.
But what it's doing roughly speaking,

692
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:35,360
is searching for a nipple.
And if you just put your finger there,

693
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:38,040
the clamp onto that and start to suck.

694
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,060
And so the child comes out with that 
ability and I'm not a reflex,

695
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:47,061
it's sort of built into the neurology.
But then when the child starts to 

696
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:48,540
interact with the mother to actually 
breastfeed,

697
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:53,570
well then that initial reflex has to be 
modified quite substantially in the 

698
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:58,260
context of the relationship with the 
mother because the bear reflex,

699
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,710
it's enough to get the thing going,
but it's not enough to make it work.

700
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,970
And so often mothers take a fair bit of 
time to learn how to breastfeed.

701
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:11,150
But it's also because the baby is taking
a fair bit of time to learn how to do 

702
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,570
it.
So they have to establish the dance that

703
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:17,571
goes with that.
And one of the things that's quite cool 

704
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:17,610
about about that dance,
so to speak,

705
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:22,611
is there's been studies done of 
depressed and non depressed mothers 

706
00:38:22,611 --> 00:38:26,450
interacting with their infants.
And so if you take a non depressed 

707
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,860
mother interacting with their infant and
you just film them and then you speed up

708
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:31,230
the film,
you can see like the mothers,

709
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,490
the baby reacts and about the rocks and 
baby racks in the mother reacts.

710
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,650
And it's like a dance.
You know,

711
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:38,650
there's this continual flow of 
information between the two of them.

712
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,660
And if the babies with a depressed 
mother,

713
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:44,710
that doesn't happen,
it's Jerky and discontinuous.

714
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,100
And so if you think about that,
you can see how the,

715
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:53,370
you know,
the dialectical interaction between the 

716
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,100
mother and child is building up the 
child's repertoire of,

717
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,080
of complex abilities within a social 
context.

718
00:38:59,081 --> 00:38:59,710
You know,
I mean,

719
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,760
I know I told you guys before the 
roughly speaking that,

720
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,880
you know,
kids really get socialized to play with 

721
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:08,880
each other,
you know,

722
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,350
between two and four.
But that's not exactly true because even

723
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:17,430
the lower level more automated and more 
primordial reflex behaviors,

724
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:19,180
you know,
like,

725
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,400
like the ones that are associated with 
breastfeeding,

726
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,010
even those developed under the 
constraints of a,

727
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:29,270
of social guidelines.
So society is always there right from 

728
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,310
the reflex level up.

729
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,760
But you know,
what happens when kids are between two 

730
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:35,890
and four hours,
they have to learn to actually play.

731
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,000
They have to learn how to play complex 
games with other children.

732
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:42,090
And so that's a whole that involves,
you know,

733
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:47,370
communication and negotiation at a 
verbal level and also with people their 

734
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,670
own age.
So you know,

735
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,660
it's continuous in some sense of 
discontinuous and in another sense.

736
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,920
Okay.
So anyways,

737
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:58,921
you might say,
well why do you bother streaming all 

738
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:01,291
these things together?
And while you think about the 

739
00:40:01,291 --> 00:40:01,660
breastfeeding issues,
well why does the baby bothered to learn

740
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:02,800
how to breastfeed?
Well,

741
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,270
that's pretty obvious,
isn't it?

742
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:05,500
I mean,
first of all,

743
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:08,980
if it doesn't then it doesn't live,
you know,

744
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:10,690
and,
and there's a bunch of reasons for that.

745
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:13,600
It's like one is obviously it's not 
going to be nourished properly,

746
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:16,690
although you know there are things you 
can do to substitute for that.

747
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,590
Although still breastfeeding still seems
to be the best thing you can do for your

748
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:23,300
baby,
although you can work around it,

749
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,110
but fundamentally it seems to be the 
best thing that you can do.

750
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,720
But then the babies also learning all 
sorts of other things,

751
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:33,721
like it's got skin to skin contact and 
it's snuggling and it's being comfort 

752
00:40:33,721 --> 00:40:35,200
and it's doing.
I gazed eye-gaze that it's coding in the

753
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:40,201
mother's imitating it and it's like 
there's just a lot of things going on 

754
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:43,441
there.
And so the child is organizing all that 

755
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,250
partly to fulfill a basic biological 
need,

756
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,830
which is post two needs,
both thirst and hunger,

757
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,110
but it's also fulfilling gets need for 
play,

758
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:55,111
for example,
because children have a circuit for 

759
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:57,751
place.
So you could say play as part of the 

760
00:40:57,751 --> 00:40:58,030
end.
It's a fundamental biological need.

761
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,210
The other thing,
children have to have his skin to skin 

762
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:03,210
touch.

763
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,990
They'll die without it.
It's not optional.

764
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,260
You even see that in racks.
So if you take a rat pop away from its 

765
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,190
mother and you feed it,
but you don't do anything with it,

766
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:13,350
it just dies.
It's,

767
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,760
it goes into opiod overdose,
roughly speaking.

768
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:18,730
It's gastrointestinal systems shut down 
and then it dies.

769
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,330
And you can stop that from happening by 
isolating it,

770
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,360
feeding it,
and then like massaging it with a 

771
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:27,360
pencil,
with the eraser,

772
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,960
end of a pencil.
You can keep the rat pup alive.

773
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,370
And,
uh,

774
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,470
Jaak Panksepp was one of the people who 
either discovered that over,

775
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:38,471
worked on it.
Then that work was extended by Tiffany 

776
00:41:38,471 --> 00:41:40,400
Fields at a,
in a hospital in Florida.

777
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:45,430
Some really brilliant work.
She was looking at Panksepp's work on 

778
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,560
the necessity of tactile stimulation and
uh,

779
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,470
she thought,
hey,

780
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:50,840
I bet we could try that with premature 
babies because,

781
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,550
you know,
babies premature.

782
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,290
Couple of things that are problems,
I mean,

783
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:57,380
first of all,
at the end of the term pregnancy through

784
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,650
and that's when babies lay on fat,
you know,

785
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,660
so they come out and they're sort of,
they've got some store storage there in 

786
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,570
case things don't get going very well,
you know,

787
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,810
and they're gaining a lot of weight to 
that last period of pregnancy.

788
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:12,020
So if they come out pretty mature then 
they're really skinny.

789
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,740
And then what happens often is they 
start to lose weight and that's not good

790
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,470
because they should be ramping up the 
weight gain really quick.

791
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:21,320
Like a newborn baby.
The elk are roads closed in one week,

792
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,860
you know,
those things are there.

793
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,040
They're gaining weight quickly to do the
premature babies lose weight and you 

794
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,030
know,
it's hard to keep them going.

795
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,790
They put them in an incubator,
they feed them.

796
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,960
But what tiffany field did was she had 
the nurses go in there,

797
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,070
you know,
with,

798
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,250
with gloves and massage the babies for 
10 minutes,

799
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:45,251
three times a day,
and those babies gained weight as fast 

800
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:48,521
as babies that were still in utero and 
you could still detect the differences 

801
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:49,190
in their development six months later.

802
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,710
Which in baby terms is like forever,
right?

803
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,980
I mean you change as much from zero 
months to six months as you probably do 

804
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,660
from six months to 20 years old.
It's such a radical transformation.

805
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,370
So,
okay.

806
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:06,371
The reason I'm telling you all this is 
because you lay out these hierarchies of

807
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:10,460
behavior that are well-practiced and 
automatized brought under the control of

808
00:43:10,461 --> 00:43:13,850
social conditioning,
but you really do them in the service of

809
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,180
of.
Well that's the question in the service 

810
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,261
of we'll say biological necessity for 
the sake of argument while you have to 

811
00:43:23,261 --> 00:43:24,310
eat and you have to drink.
And so one of the ways,

812
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,410
one of the reasons you lay out the 
hierarchy that's associated with 

813
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,560
breastfeeding is so you can do that 
directly,

814
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:36,370
but also so that you can establish a 
relationship so that not only are you 

815
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,881
doing it directly this day,
but you're also going to do it tomorrow 

816
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:41,330
and the next day and the day after that.

817
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,360
And so the hunger system is integrated 
with these other systems have a 

818
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,981
biological constraint in some sense,
and they're trying to come up with an 

819
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:56,171
answer to the continual problem.
So you have dedicated biological systems

820
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,200
that help you address problems that are 
associated with your biological nature 

821
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:05,410
that are universal.
And those would be the things that Freud

822
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,710
would describe as the end.
So you can think of these hierarchies of

823
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:14,711
motor behavior which sort of develop up 
into sub personalities as nested in some

824
00:44:15,801 --> 00:44:20,801
sense inside motivational states.
So there's the motor behavior hierarchy 

825
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:27,431
that you use when you're angry.
There's a motor behavior hierarchy you 

826
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,700
use when you're distressed and kids get 
very good at that,

827
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,290
you know,
so they'll cry,

828
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:33,990
which is reflex.
But by the time they're about to,

829
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,620
they're pretty damn good at crying,
you know,

830
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:41,630
they've got a,
they've got a cry that sounds like 

831
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:41,630
they're sad and upset when they're 
really angry.

832
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,030
And so if you really listen,
you can hear the difference because baby

833
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:47,520
angry baby sounds different than a sad 
baby.

834
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,440
But if you don't listen,
the baby will have you think.

835
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,990
And it's sad.
No problem.

836
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:53,620
Then you'll feel sorry for it and go,
you know,

837
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,450
help it out.
Really,

838
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:59,451
it's just thinking up years.
So we know this partly because.

839
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,330
So let's say you've got a baby and it's 
under nine months,

840
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,470
six months old and it's crying and it's 
crip.

841
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:05,940
You think,
well,

842
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,250
what do you do?
Go in there and you pick up the baby and

843
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,520
you're comforted.
And you probably do that pretty much 

844
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:13,520
nonstop.
When the babies that young,

845
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,040
you know,
because they're so young,

846
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:16,500
they should really still be in utero.
They're really young.

847
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,530
But by nine months that may be starting 
to get smart.

848
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,950
And so it's about nine months when it 
can visually recognize people he knows 

849
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:25,790
and,
and people,

850
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,510
people here she doesn't know.

851
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,410
And so then the babies in there and 
it's,

852
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:35,411
you know,
squawking a bit and so wants some 

853
00:45:35,411 --> 00:45:38,031
attention and then someone walks in and 
it's not the mother and the baby bursts 

854
00:45:38,031 --> 00:45:38,160
into tears and people think,
oh,

855
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:40,470
that baby's all sad because it's mother 
didn't show up.

856
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:45,471
It's like it's not sad.
It's really irritated that the wrong 

857
00:45:45,471 --> 00:45:48,831
person showed up and you can tell that 
because people have done facial coding 

858
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:53,031
of the baby's expression and also with 
skin tone and an angry baby looks angry 

859
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:57,861
first of all and it turns all red.
It's like it's really angry and you see 

860
00:45:57,861 --> 00:46:01,881
that behavior later too.
And temper tantrums like a two year old 

861
00:46:01,881 --> 00:46:04,380
is having a temper tantrum.
It's just having a fit of rage.

862
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,160
The rage system,
because there is a rage system,

863
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,460
is just completely out of control.
It's just absolutely dominating their 

864
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,911
behavior and you don't really want to 
encourage that because the rage system 

865
00:46:16,911 --> 00:46:21,591
should start to be modulated by other 
systems and other higher order control 

866
00:46:21,591 --> 00:46:21,591
systems.

867
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:26,630
Not so much suppressed or repressed,
which is sort of how the Freudians with 

868
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,190
thing,
but integrated into more complex and 

869
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,860
sophisticated modes of action so the 
child can use its anger,

870
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:34,980
which is an extraordinary and useful 
capacity,

871
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:36,690
you know,
because it allows you to defend yourself

872
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:41,930
so the child can learn to use that in a 
sophisticated way so that it can solve 

873
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:45,810
the problems that would lead to a range 
attack without ever getting to the point

874
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:47,600
where it has to be enraged,
right?

875
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,250
That's a functional child.
It's not like it's learned to repress,

876
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:55,251
it's anger,
it's just that it gets along with 

877
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:55,251
people.
It never has to get angry.

878
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:58,050
So now some kids learn to repress their 
anger because you know,

879
00:46:58,051 --> 00:47:03,051
they're in a household where any 
manifestation of anger is dealt with 

880
00:47:03,051 --> 00:47:04,080
very,
very harshly.

881
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:09,290
You know,
and maybe there's a rule that everyone 

882
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:09,290
has to be nice to each other all of the 
time.

883
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,010
You or else sort of a paradoxical rule.
But anyways,

884
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,080
you can imagine now there's a lot of 
these biological systems.

885
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:20,160
And so I want to show you some of their 
instantiation here.

886
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:25,161
So let's look at this one.
So when you get up above the spinal 

887
00:47:25,161 --> 00:47:29,571
cord,
there's a little brain area I'll show 

888
00:47:29,571 --> 00:47:31,120
you about how big it is.
There it is.

889
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:35,800
So there's your brain,
the the top one part of the part on top.

890
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:41,010
That's the cerebral cortex.
That's the part that people are really 

891
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:41,010
proud of.
It's like,

892
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:41,920
Oh wow,
look at our cerebral cortex,

893
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:44,110
you know,
doesn't have a lot of neurons.

894
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:49,111
And then in the middle there there are 
older brain areas of genetically old and

895
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,210
then as you go down towards the spinal 
cord,

896
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:54,160
they basically get older and older and 
older and older.

897
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,230
So and more and more critical to your 
development.

898
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:04,230
So the serotonin system,
we talked about it a little bit in 

899
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:04,230
lobsters,
right?

900
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,500
Serotonin system is the thing that sort 
of determines where a lobster is in the 

901
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,600
dominance hierarchy determines whether 
it stands like this or whether it stands

902
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:12,760
like this.
That's an old system.

903
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:15,010
And when your brain is developing in 
Utero,

904
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,800
this serotonin system that guides its 
development.

905
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:23,040
So that's how important it is.
It's sort of like the conductor of the 

906
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,101
orchestra,
but it's also the thing that controls 

907
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:28,120
the entire unfolding of the brain and it
comes from,

908
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,440
you know,
really,

909
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:30,580
really,
it's a really,

910
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:33,730
really archaic system.
So in some sense you're,

911
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:39,350
you're,
you're being is controlled by these 

912
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:39,350
things that are ancient beyond 
comprehension,

913
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,050
you know.
Anyways,

914
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,370
you look at the Hypothalamus,
you think,

915
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:43,720
wow,
that's not very big,

916
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,580
and uh,
yeah,

917
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:49,520
it's not.
But if you take a cat and you.

918
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,520
So cat bring looks,
something like that,

919
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,880
if you take off all the stuff that's in 
light orange and most of the top of the 

920
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,300
stuff above the hypothalamus that's in 
white,

921
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,680
just take all that out.
It's a female cat and it's in a cage.

922
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,710
You really can't tell the difference 
between Ada and the cap that has all the

923
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,070
rest of that brain.
Now there's some things that can't do.

924
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,640
It doesn't do very well if you take it 
into a new situation because he can't 

925
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,350
learn more.
More importantly,

926
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,230
in some sense,
it can't remember.

927
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,920
So it's in a perpetual state of 
everything happening for the very first 

928
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,941
time,
but it's still capable of a lot of the 

929
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:29,431
reactions that would be necessary in 
order for you to stay alive so it can 

930
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:30,670
regulate its liquid intake,
can regulate its food intake,

931
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,660
it can react sexually.
It's capable of defensive aggression,

932
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:36,460
although it'll really fly into a rage.

933
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,030
And so it's Kinda like a disinhibited 
two year old in some sense,

934
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:41,560
you know,
and uh,

935
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:47,130
you know,
as long as you keep it in the cage and 

936
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:47,130
provide it with food and water,
it's like the way it lives.

937
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:52,120
And it's hyper exploratory,
which I think is just weird beyond 

938
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,741
belief.
It's like you take the brain off a cat 

939
00:49:55,741 --> 00:49:56,290
and then all it wants to do is explore,
which is not what you think at all.

940
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:59,260
It's like a cat with no brain is really 
curious.

941
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,190
It just doesn't make sense.
But it does actually because the systems

942
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:08,191
that drive your exploratory urge are 
rooted in the hypothalamus and they're 

943
00:50:08,531 --> 00:50:10,960
actually the same systems.
The,

944
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:15,961
it's,
it's a individual differences in the 

945
00:50:15,961 --> 00:50:17,980
function and sensitivity of those 
systems that are in part associated with

946
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:22,981
individual differences in extroversion,
so extroverts sort of hyper exploratory 

947
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:24,970
in social situations,
whereas introverts aren't.

948
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:30,390
And the exploratory circuit that,
that has its origins in the hypothalamus

949
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,600
runs on dopamine,
roughly speaking,

950
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,960
and then it runs through the base of 
your brain and then up into your,

951
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,510
up into your prefrontal cortex in 
particular.

952
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,840
And it's also the system that responds 
to cocaine and amphetamines and other 

953
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,400
drugs that people like to take because 
they heightened positive emotion.

954
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,850
So,
so it's very ability at a very,

955
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:54,851
very low level in the brain that 
determines things like the differences 

956
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,490
in extroverts and introverts.
So anyways,

957
00:50:57,491 --> 00:51:00,110
it's this tiny little part of the brain 
yet,

958
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,690
you know,
if that's all you have,

959
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:04,130
you can get along.
Not too bad.

960
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,810
Um,
so,

961
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,100
but that's also because it's tiny from 
one level of analysis,

962
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:12,620
but it's really big from another,
you know,

963
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,770
I mean you can,
you can increase your resolution when 

964
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,500
you're doing brain analysis all the way 
down to the molecular level and still be

965
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:23,220
looking at the brain,
you know,

966
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:26,000
below them amount like you level at the 
atomic level.

967
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:26,720
It's sort of,
well,

968
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:31,721
everything's made out of atoms,
but the brain is already there at a 

969
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:35,681
molecular level and it's insanely 
complicated at the molecular level and 

970
00:51:35,681 --> 00:51:37,910
the hypothalamus is way bigger than a 
molecule.

971
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,480
And so even though it's small compared 
to the rest of our brain,

972
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,200
it's still a whopping big structured by 
atomic standards.

973
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,090
And so there's a hell of a lot going on 
down there.

974
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:49,220
And you notice the Hypothalamus,
you might say,

975
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:50,180
well,
is there such a.

976
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,100
You said,
is there such a thing as the ID?

977
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,500
Well,

978
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,240
yes,
no.

979
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,240
Is it in the brain?
Yes and no.

980
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,140
It's really low resolution 
representation of what's in the brain.

981
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:05,870
That's one way of thinking about it.
But then you might say,

982
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:07,370
well,
is there a hypothalamus?

983
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,050
And the answer to that is,
well,

984
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:14,051
yes and no because there's a 
hypothalamic structure and you see it's 

985
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:14,960
made out of a bunch of things that are 
different.

986
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,430
And so you could say,
well,

987
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:18,470
should you even group those things 
together?

988
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,390
Well,
the answer to that is,

989
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,220
it depends on why you're grouping them 
together,

990
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,400
you know,
if it's useful for some purpose of 

991
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:27,770
understanding or control to group them 
together.

992
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,480
I mean they're,
they,

993
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,560
they,
they are similar in the way that they 

994
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,791
emerge in the course of brain 
development and they're roughly of the 

995
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:39,581
same phylogenetic age,
but there's lots of reasons to treat 

996
00:52:39,581 --> 00:52:43,001
them as the same.
And there's lots of reasons to treat 

997
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:45,131
them as different.
It depends on what you're trying to do 

998
00:52:45,131 --> 00:52:45,920
anyways.
The hypothalamus has all these little

999
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:52,470
sub what,
what do you call

1000
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,840
sub structures that are really in some 
sense that the core of the sub 

1001
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:01,390
personalities that we talked about.
So for example,

1002
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:02,650
um,

1003
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:08,690
okay,
so this is,

1004
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:13,750
this is Swanson again and he's showing 
you this is a rat's brain from the 

1005
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,850
bottom and he's showing you the layout 
of the hypothalamus.

1006
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:19,020
You see it's got all those different,
um,

1007
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,190
nuclei doesn't look like one thing,
it looks like a bunch of things.

1008
00:53:22,191 --> 00:53:27,191
And so here he says,
the descending paraventricular nucleus 

1009
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:32,190
is involved in the control of eating and
drinking and that's shown in green.

1010
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,910
So that's the thing that when you get 
hungry or thirsty,

1011
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,330
that's the thing that's sort of turns on
you're hungry and thirsty,

1012
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:44,370
subpersonality.
And then the rest of the cell groups 

1013
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:48,141
play a major role in controlling two 
classes of social behaviors that his is 

1014
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:52,370
involving interactions between animals,
reproductive as the red areas and 

1015
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:54,840
defensive,
the purplish areas.

1016
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:00,650
So now what you can think is you have 
all those little sub routines that were 

1017
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:00,780
talked about,
you know,

1018
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,940
that are sort of at hand and ready to 
go.

1019
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:08,090
And then they're organized underneath 
these major classes of motivation so 

1020
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:12,480
that you have to do something like eat.
And so they,

1021
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:17,481
the,
it's like there's an eating robot in 

1022
00:54:17,481 --> 00:54:17,481
you.
That's one way of thinking about it,

1023
00:54:17,481 --> 00:54:19,260
except it's smarter than that.
And it's alive and conscious.

1024
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,730
You know,
these things are alive.

1025
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,920
They're not machines and they're not 
deterministic.

1026
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:28,670
They're just subbed there partial.
You can pick them as low resolution 

1027
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,040
personalities or unit dimensional 
personalities because the only thing the

1028
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:36,041
eating system really cares about is 
whether or not you eat and the drinking 

1029
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:39,261
system is the same thing you know you 
see malfunctioned sometimes in people 

1030
00:54:39,261 --> 00:54:41,970
have these singular system so you can 
develop a condition.

1031
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:46,140
If you have hypothalamic damage where 
you you'll drink yourself,

1032
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,670
you'll drink water until you die and no 
one can stop you.

1033
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:52,410
You know they could lock you in a room 
away from sinks and that would stop you,

1034
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:57,710
but you'd be raging away inside trying 
to claw through the door to get to the 

1035
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,071
damn water because you're so hyper 
thirsty that it's all that there is left

1036
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:04,530
of you in some sense that if you're 
allowed access to a tap,

1037
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,680
you'll just drink and drink and drink 
and drink and drink and drink and drink 

1038
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:09,680
until you drown.

1039
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,350
And you know,
people can say,

1040
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,610
Hey,
you've had enough water.

1041
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:12,900
It's like,
forget that.

1042
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,240
The hypothalamus is a major league 
system and when push comes to shove,

1043
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:23,330
it's the thing that's in control.
And one of the ways of thinking about 

1044
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:27,021
the way that you organize your,
your life is that the hypothalamus 

1045
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:30,030
controls the major motivational systems.
We just talked about those.

1046
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:32,790
And so those are the things that people 
would think about as drives,

1047
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,670
although they're not driving,
they're too complicated to be drives.

1048
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,510
And then there's other systems that come
up later that we'll also talk about that

1049
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:44,511
or eat that governed emotion like 
anxiety and a and a different system 

1050
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:49,731
that governs pain.
Partly what you're trying to do as you 

1051
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:51,180
organize your life is to make sure those
systems stay shut off.

1052
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:52,800
And then you think,
well,

1053
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:54,000
I'm in control.
It's like,

1054
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,990
well no,
you're not.

1055
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,520
You're just satisfied all of the things 
that could take control from you.

1056
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,890
And so now you have a modicum of choice.
You can.

1057
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:04,830
And basically what you're doing when all
of these things have had,

1058
00:56:04,831 --> 00:56:06,680
what they need is you're running around 
exploring,

1059
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,340
you know,
and that's,

1060
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:13,390
you know,
that's also another one of these 

1061
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:13,390
circuits because the hypothalamus,
as I already said,

1062
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:13,830
governance,
exploration.

1063
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,340
So a lot of see all psychologists often 
get things backwards and they ask silly 

1064
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:26,050
like why are people anxious?
That's a stupid question.

1065
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,650
It's how people,
why are people ever calm?

1066
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,650
That's a question because it's like,
why are you anxious?

1067
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:37,680
Well,
think of all the terrible things that 

1068
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,230
can happen to you and they will happen 
to you even worse.

1069
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,730
And there isn't anything you could do 
about it.

1070
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:44,731
It's like,
why aren't you quaking in your boots 

1071
00:56:44,731 --> 00:56:44,731
just sitting there?
Well that's a mystery,

1072
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:46,030
you know?
And then,

1073
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,070
well,
you know,

1074
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,710
here you are in your normal state.
It's like,

1075
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,780
well no,
this is not a normal state.

1076
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:58,110
People have been trying for 7 million 
years like as people to create a 

1077
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:06,090
situation so complex and comfortable 
that a couple hundred of you can sit 

1078
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:06,790
here,
you know,

1079
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:11,850
without having your hypothalamus driving
you towards something and actually just 

1080
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,440
listened to something for a few hours.
That's not normal.

1081
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:18,010
That's so staggeringly abnormal that,
that you know,

1082
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:21,130
it's a miracle that the typical person 
like.

1083
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,720
And for most of human history it's like 
you were hungry man.

1084
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:31,470
And that's not the same like you people.
But some of you have probably been 

1085
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:31,570
hungry in your life,
but I mean,

1086
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,560
what's the longest and is there someone 
here who's going without food for more 

1087
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,050
than one day.
Okay.

1088
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:40,540
Has anybody here going without food for 
more than a week.

1089
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,480
Okay.
Okay.

1090
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,950
How about three days?

1091
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,720
Okay.
So like are you hungry?

1092
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,450
No.
No.

1093
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:55,550
You're hungry when you haven't had 
anything to eat for 20 days then you're 

1094
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:55,550
hungry,
you know,

1095
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:59,451
so.
And the same goes for thirst and cold 

1096
00:57:59,451 --> 00:58:00,540
and all the things that were just never 
exposed to.

1097
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:05,541
So we know,
we think civilized people are all calm 

1098
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:05,541
and nice and easy to get along with.
It's like,

1099
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:06,630
yeah,
well you know,

1100
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,010
you have absolutely everything you need 
all the time.

1101
00:58:11,011 --> 00:58:16,011
So that makes you as easy to get along 
with is any completely insane primate 

1102
00:58:16,011 --> 00:58:17,070
ever get.
So.

1103
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,580
Okay.
So the rep,

1104
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:21,810
you might say,
well God,

1105
00:58:21,811 --> 00:58:23,730
if you can survive with just the 
hypothalamus,

1106
00:58:23,731 --> 00:58:27,120
what is the rest of the brain?
And their answer is,

1107
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:32,360
well,
if you're thirsty,

1108
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:35,200
oh,
let's say you're angry.

1109
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,270
100 system isn't going to be able to 
take care of that.

1110
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,920
Right?
So you're hungry.

1111
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:39,880
Okay.
That works,

1112
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,770
you're angry,
that works,

1113
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,670
but then you have another problem which 
is you're hungry now when you're angry.

1114
00:58:45,671 --> 00:58:50,170
Now perhaps you can move through those 
states.

1115
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,060
You watch that,
you see that in two year olds.

1116
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,920
It's partly why they're so fun to be 
around.

1117
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,180
It's like,
first of all,

1118
00:58:55,181 --> 00:59:00,181
they're really excited.
They're running around playing and then 

1119
00:59:00,181 --> 00:59:02,540
you know,
they trip and then they're crying like 

1120
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,351
man,
and then you poke them and they laugh 

1121
00:59:04,351 --> 00:59:04,400
and then they want something to eat and 
then they fall asleep and you know,

1122
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,220
they're just,
they're just running.

1123
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:11,250
They're run by their hypothalamus and 
it's really fun to see because they're 

1124
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,190
so alive and so enthusiastic and 
spontaneous,

1125
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:17,490
but they're completely clueless.
It's like you take one who throws his 

1126
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:18,040
creatures to the mall and leave it there
and it's like,

1127
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:20,890
it's just not happy at all and the 
reason for that,

1128
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:27,370
well,
it doesn't know how to sequence any of 

1129
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:27,370
its actions,
right?

1130
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:30,070
It runs through these states of ne,
but it isn't complicated enough to 

1131
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:35,561
figure out how to address those needs in
any consistent sense across multiple 

1132
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:37,940
environments.
In a social world.

1133
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:43,210
You need the rest of your brain for that
and so and that again fits in with the 

1134
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:47,200
Piagetian idea is that what you're doing
is you're taking these micro 

1135
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,970
personalities that are basically 
instantiated within the hypothalamus and

1136
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:54,971
then you're organizing those into more 
and more complex games and you need the 

1137
00:59:54,971 --> 00:59:59,051
cortex to do that because the cortex is 
partly what enables you just to think 

1138
00:59:59,051 --> 01:00:01,310
about time,
you know,

1139
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,400
because the hypothalamus is.
It's all right here and now thing like 

1140
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,910
the hypothalamic cat lives in the 
present.

1141
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:10,400
There's that president and now see it.
No,

1142
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,640
you probably get some sense of that.
Like there are one of the things that 

1143
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,841
happens to people if they take 
unfettered means or if they take 

1144
01:00:19,841 --> 01:00:21,470
psychedelic drugs,
is that some of the inhibitory control.

1145
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:27,310
Some of them are complex control systems
that are critical shutdown and so then 

1146
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:32,141
they enter a state where it's all now 
and you know the now just comes at 

1147
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:35,810
people in that state.
It's a transcendent experience.

1148
01:00:35,811 --> 01:00:39,590
But of course you know,
just fight that you're not functional.

1149
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:45,190
And so in some sense you trade that 
transcended relationship with reality 

1150
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:47,510
for a narrow functionality and that's 
too bad,

1151
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,250
that's life,
but you know,

1152
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:50,000
it's,
it's a,

1153
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,100
it's a tradeoff.
So anyways,

1154
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:57,101
you're organizing these sub 
personalities and you're using your 

1155
01:00:57,101 --> 01:01:00,731
cortex to do that because you know,
you don't just have to think about 

1156
01:01:00,731 --> 01:01:03,911
eating,
you have to think about how am I going 

1157
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:04,490
to get the food,
when is the food going to come,

1158
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:09,610
how am I going to cook the food,
what about all the other people that 

1159
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:10,190
want to eat,
how do we regulate that in our family?

1160
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:15,370
And then how do we regulate that with 
the fact that we also need to sleep and 

1161
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:18,431
we need to work and we need to get along
with other people and we need to have 

1162
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:21,131
something interesting to do and like 
it's ridiculously complicated and it 

1163
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:26,021
really doesn't.
There's no end to the complication 

1164
01:01:26,021 --> 01:01:26,021
because

1165
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,160
you know,
maybe you're just solving the problem 

1166
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,961
for you then too.
Or maybe you're trying to work it out 

1167
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:36,801
within your family.
Well then that sort of like the chrome 

1168
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:39,501
brothers,
they never get out of their family 

1169
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:41,061
because they just never come to an 
arrangement that works well enough so 

1170
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:41,061
that they can,
you know,

1171
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:42,210
in some sense move into the broader 
world.

1172
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,700
Then you solve the family problem,
but then you've got the,

1173
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:48,810
like the tribe problem and you know,
maybe you can solve that to some degree,

1174
01:01:48,811 --> 01:01:50,790
but then you have the broader political 
problem.

1175
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,960
It's like,
you know,

1176
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,650
there's an infinite number of problems 
that crop up for you to solve,

1177
01:01:55,651 --> 01:02:00,651
so there's plenty for you to do with 
your big cortex and when we paid a big 

1178
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,280
price for that thing,
because once we discovered time,

1179
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:04,690
no,

1180
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,800
we could make a bargain with the future,
which is basically what you do when you 

1181
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,220
regulate your behavior.
You're making a bargain with the future.

1182
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:18,460
You say to yourself,
if I forego so and so now than later,

1183
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,150
oh,
it'll pay off.

1184
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:24,630
And that's real useful.
You can conceptualize the future and you

1185
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:27,390
can conceptualize the future as 
something you can bargain with,

1186
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,020
but there's a cost to that.
One is you can't,

1187
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,070
you don't get to do just what you want 
right now,

1188
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:37,180
and of course that sucks.
It's partly why people drink alcohol 

1189
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:41,140
because alcohol is disinhibiting.
It stops you from thinking it actually 

1190
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:45,291
doesn't stop you from thinking about the
future by the way it stops you from 

1191
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:49,100
caring about what you think about the 
future and that's just as good and so 

1192
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:53,871
then you could go out and have fun 
because fun is impulsive and often 

1193
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:57,411
extremely dangerous because the longterm
consequences can be really devastating,

1194
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,020
but it's a real pain to keep yourself 
controlled all the time,

1195
01:03:01,021 --> 01:03:06,021
you know,
because you're foregoing direct reward 

1196
01:03:06,021 --> 01:03:06,500
constantly.

1197
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:11,780
You know,
I think it's part of the reason why 

1198
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,320
people in heavily industrialized complex
countries aren't necessarily happy.

1199
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,640
It's like,
you know,

1200
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,860
it takes a lot out grinding away to keep
all the machinery that keeps all of this

1201
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:21,390
in place going.
You know,

1202
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:25,380
so you're not getting typhoid and know 
tigers aren't tearing you apart.

1203
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:30,381
But by the same token,
you have to be unbelievably disciplined 

1204
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:34,640
and ready to act constantly to keep 
everything that's so complex around you 

1205
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,600
work it.
And that's not necessarily fun.

1206
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,480
So,
okay,

1207
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,720
now let's look at something else.
Now you can tell me if I took,

1208
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,640
if I showed you this,
I hope I didn't show you this.

1209
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,020
You see that?
Okay,

1210
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:09,021
good.
Now some of you know this and so you 

1211
01:04:09,021 --> 01:04:11,781
just don't say anything,
although you probably don't know this 

1212
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:14,370
specific version.
So you're gonna if you've seen this sort

1213
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:16,020
of thing before,
you're going to think you're smart while

1214
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:19,470
you're watching it,
but it'll probably still trip you up.

1215
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:22,860
I hope so.
Give me a sec here at all.

1216
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,190
See if we can actually get some sound 
out of this thing.

1217
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:40,210
The monkey business count.
How many times the players wearing white

1218
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:41,990
pass the ball?

1219
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,290
The correct answer is 16.

1220
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:24,790
Did you spot the gorilla for people who 
haven't seen or heard about a video like

1221
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:28,780
this before?
About half miss the gorilla.

1222
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,440
If you knew about the gorilla,
you probably saw it,

1223
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,800
but did you notice the curtain changing 
color or the player on the black team 

1224
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:39,800
leaving the game?

1225
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:54,090
Here comes the gorilla and there goes a 
player and the curtain is changing from 

1226
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:54,100
red to gold.

1227
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:05,320
What you're looking for a gorilla,
the monkey learn more about this 

1228
01:06:10,991 --> 01:06:15,250
illusion and the original gorilla 
experiment@invisiblegorilla.com.

1229
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,980
Yeah.
So that's quite a.

1230
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:28,640
that's quite illustration.
So one of the questions you might ask 

1231
01:06:30,301 --> 01:06:31,470
is,
well,

1232
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,280
okay.
First of all,

1233
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:35,970
how many of you didn't see the gorilla?
Okay.

1234
01:06:35,971 --> 01:06:38,280
How many of you have seen this sort of 
video before?

1235
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:43,430
Okay,
so you knew about the damn grill of the 

1236
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:43,430
people who didn't know about the 
gorilla.

1237
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:47,070
How many people didn't see the gorilla?
Okay,

1238
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,140
fine.
How many of you got the other things?

1239
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,060
Both of them.
Okay,

1240
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,170
so you get the point.
The point is,

1241
01:06:55,171 --> 01:06:58,290
and it's brilliant instrument,
it's an insanely brilliant experiment.

1242
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:06,130
You're blind to a ridiculous degree and 
your visual system and your brain are 

1243
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:10,530
constantly coping with the fact that 
you're blind.

1244
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:13,260
You know,
I mean you can kind of detective to some

1245
01:07:13,261 --> 01:07:18,261
degree,
like if you look at someone but you pay 

1246
01:07:18,261 --> 01:07:18,261
attention to the things that surround 
them.

1247
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,520
You'll see that like,
so I'm looking at you.

1248
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,150
I can't see your nose for sure.
It's gone.

1249
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:27,630
I can't see your face.
I can see your glasses.

1250
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,660
I can't see any features in your face 
goal.

1251
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:36,470
Can you smile?
The one behind so.

1252
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:42,140
Well,
one of the things I've noticed when 

1253
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:42,140
doing this is that like if you look 
here,

1254
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,070
look at my finger,
but pay attention to my face.

1255
01:07:44,071 --> 01:07:45,990
It's really hard because normally when 
you pay attention,

1256
01:07:45,991 --> 01:07:47,790
you move your eyes to what you're paying
attention to.

1257
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,740
Okay?
So here's what you might say.

1258
01:07:50,741 --> 01:07:52,980
The first thing you might see is that 
you can't see my nose.

1259
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:57,240
The second thing you might see is that 
you can really see my eyes,

1260
01:07:57,241 --> 01:07:58,240
especially if they moved.

1261
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:04,670
God.
It's so weird.

1262
01:08:04,671 --> 01:08:06,370
It's like all of a sudden these eyes pop
up.

1263
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,910
Yeah.
So we'll try this too.

1264
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,750
Okay,
so look at my finger again.

1265
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,240
So you can also see teeth.
Well,

1266
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:18,620
why?
Well,

1267
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:21,260
if you're looking here and there's 
something there with eyes and teeth,

1268
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:23,100
you should probably be able to see it.
Right?

1269
01:08:23,101 --> 01:08:26,600
And so what that basically means is he 
bought this tiny little phobia,

1270
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,520
which is right in the center of your 
retina.

1271
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:33,730
It's just densely packed with cells and 
then those cells transmit information 

1272
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:38,771
along the optic nerve and they're just 
connected like mad to cells in the 

1273
01:08:38,771 --> 01:08:41,150
visual Cortex,
but you don't have that much room so you

1274
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:44,180
can connect all of the cells in your 
retina to 10,000

1275
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:49,181
cells.
Like at the first level of connection 

1276
01:08:49,181 --> 01:08:49,181
you'd have to have a brain this big,
you know,

1277
01:08:49,181 --> 01:08:53,530
and you don't.
So you get by and part of the way you 

1278
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:57,251
get by as you're always moving your eyes
around and so it looks like you can see 

1279
01:08:57,251 --> 01:08:57,290
everything but you can't.

1280
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:02,830
In fact,
I'll hear like if I'm looking at you 

1281
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:02,830
now,
I can tell them my hands are there.

1282
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:04,280
Although if I didn't know they were 
hands,

1283
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:08,840
I probably couldn't figure it out there.
There are kind of blurry I would say.

1284
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:13,130
And they're in black and white,
but I can't tell that you know,

1285
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:16,130
so out here it's like who cares what 
color it is?

1286
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,250
So you just don't see the color but you 
don't know that you don't see the color.

1287
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:22,910
And then of course I can have my hands 
here and then I put them here,

1288
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,950
I can hardly see them.
And then they're gone.

1289
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:27,530
They're gone.
It's like they don't even exist.

1290
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,550
It's not even,
you know,

1291
01:09:28,551 --> 01:09:33,551
because you think in some sense that 
what was behind your head would be 

1292
01:09:33,551 --> 01:09:34,790
black.
Like when you close your eyes,

1293
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:40,330
that's nothing but no one knows.
What you can't see behind your head is 

1294
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:40,580
so not there that it isn't.

1295
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:42,560
You know,
it's literally,

1296
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:46,780
it isn't even not there.
That's all gone.

1297
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:48,200
It is.
So.

1298
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:53,920
Okay.
So part of the way that your eyes work 

1299
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,871
is that the periphery is attached to 
devices in some sense.

1300
01:09:57,171 --> 01:09:59,930
And some of them detect lines and some 
of them detect movement.

1301
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:05,170
You remember Jurassic Park don't move,
the dinosaur can't see you unless you 

1302
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:05,750
move.
It's like,

1303
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,760
yeah,
frogs are like that.

1304
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,920
And cats are like that.
To some degree.

1305
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,950
They can really see things move this way
because of the risers slit.

1306
01:10:13,951 --> 01:10:17,090
It makes it easier for them to see 
things moving like this.

1307
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,130
They're not so good at things moving 
like this.

1308
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:20,630
Well,
it's because they chase mice,

1309
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:22,310
right?
And most mice,

1310
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:27,520
you know,
except like ones that they moved this 

1311
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,701
way and so cats are specialized for that
and so you're also specialized to see 

1312
01:10:30,701 --> 01:10:35,411
teeth and an ice because you want to 
know if something's looking at you and 

1313
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:36,440
you want to know if it has teeth.

1314
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:41,710
And so what that means in part is that 
the surrounding tissue in your eyes 

1315
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,930
reports to some degree to your visual 
Cortex,

1316
01:10:44,931 --> 01:10:48,230
which is what you used to actually have 
conscious vision with,

1317
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:53,500
but a lot of it just dumps down into the
some of the brain areas we haven't 

1318
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,591
talked about.
Not necessarily directly down to the 

1319
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:59,561
hypothalamus,
although I suspect it has the inputs 

1320
01:10:59,561 --> 01:10:59,561
there.
I just don't know.

1321
01:10:59,561 --> 01:11:03,940
But your eyes talk to your spinal cord 
directly so that you could see something

1322
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:05,210
snake light,
for example,

1323
01:11:05,211 --> 01:11:06,990
in jumped,
just like your.

1324
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,170
You jump.
If your hand touches a hot stove,

1325
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:14,410
you don't even see the snake snake junk.
And the reason for that is you waiting 

1326
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:18,831
around to see the snake.
It's like it's bitten you 15 times and 

1327
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:18,831
your dad.
So you can't wait around and see this,

1328
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:20,970
oh look,
a snake.

1329
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:22,470
And you jump,
it's like,

1330
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:24,120
no,
that doesn't work,

1331
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,480
so your body has conserved all these 
layers of reflexive movement all the way

1332
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:34,791
up to a higher order voluntary movement,
because otherwise you just wouldn't be 

1333
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:39,291
fast enough when something super fast 
happens and then the way your eyes are 

1334
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:42,570
built so your eyes can tell your body to
jump if no vision,

1335
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:42,750
right?

1336
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,900
It's just pattern,
snake pattern jump pattern,

1337
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,880
snake pattern,
retinal pattern,

1338
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,740
optic nerve pattern,
brain pattern,

1339
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,840
muscle pattern,
no vision,

1340
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:53,180
no.
See,

1341
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:58,340
because you don't need to see it.
You just have to do pattern pattern 

1342
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:58,340
matching,
right?

1343
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:02,091
It's a weird way of thinking about it,
but it's not much different than the 

1344
01:12:02,091 --> 01:12:02,091
touching.
You know,

1345
01:12:02,091 --> 01:12:06,770
you can feel the pattern.
You can build a three dimensional 

1346
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:08,010
representation of it.
You can really see well with your eyes.

1347
01:12:08,011 --> 01:12:11,070
It's like the idea that blind people 
can't see as a really dopey idea.

1348
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:16,370
It can't see color and they're not very 
good at detecting things in the 

1349
01:12:16,370 --> 01:12:16,830
distance,
but they have a visual world.

1350
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:19,020
It's just built out of things that don't
have color.

1351
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:24,250
You know?
You know perfectly well that that's the 

1352
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,140
case because I could hand you an object 
and you can fiddle around with it behind

1353
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:30,141
your back and after some fiddling around
he knew exactly what it looked like and 

1354
01:12:30,141 --> 01:12:31,440
you know,
you might pull it out here and say,

1355
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:32,940
well,
I didn't know it was blue.

1356
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:33,550
It's like,
yeah,

1357
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:34,710
okay,
fair enough.

1358
01:12:34,711 --> 01:12:39,711
You didn't know it was blue,
but you still saw it and you can get 

1359
01:12:39,711 --> 01:12:39,990
pretty God damn good vision with your 
ears.

1360
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:43,230
So there are kids who are blind who've 
learned to echolocate.

1361
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:45,480
So they go click,
click.

1362
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:50,700
They don't make that noise exactly.
But they do click and they can detect 

1363
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,040
the clicks bouncing off of things and 
they can do that well enough.

1364
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:58,070
Not only to walk,
but some of them can actually ride 

1365
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:58,070
bikes.
It's like,

1366
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:58,360
hey,
that's impressive man.

1367
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:00,600
So,
so what's that?

1368
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,490
Yeah,
there's one kid,

1369
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:05,310
I saw a kid on youtube who was blind who
could shoot baskets.

1370
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:06,080
Yeah.
Which is thought,

1371
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,870
hey,
that's impressive now.

1372
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,430
But you know,
my point is,

1373
01:13:09,431 --> 01:13:10,350
is that,
you know,

1374
01:13:10,351 --> 01:13:14,280
a lot of the neural tissue is intake.
Whatever input it gets.

1375
01:13:14,281 --> 01:13:16,320
And so if you're born blind,
your,

1376
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:21,360
your auditory systems will invade your 
visual system and then you have twice as

1377
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:22,920
much brain devoted to your hearing.

1378
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,370
So,
and then you know,

1379
01:13:24,371 --> 01:13:26,490
you can use that quite effectively.
So.

1380
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:32,270
Alright.
So I think we're probably pretty much 

1381
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:34,790
time.
The one thing I want to tell you before 

1382
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,011
we go onto the next part though is that,
so now we've sort of built up the idea 

1383
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:41,601
of these underlying motivational systems
and now you can kind of see how they 

1384
01:13:41,601 --> 01:13:43,380
work.
So you might say to yourself,

1385
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:48,890
why didn't you see the gorilla and the 
curtain and the person leaving?

1386
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:52,440
It's really complicated.
It's really complicated.

1387
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:58,130
Well,
the first answer is you did what I 

1388
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:59,670
asked,
and then you might ask,

1389
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:01,860
well why?
Why did you do what I asked?

1390
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:03,240
I mean,
you miss the damn gorilla,

1391
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:04,010
right?
It's like,

1392
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,060
obviously that wasn't a very good 
decision.

1393
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:08,760
So you think,
well why did you do what I asked?

1394
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And the answer would be,
well it's sort of like the milgram 

1395
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,510
obedience experiment except lower level.

1396
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:19,030
It's like we've got an agreement going 
on here.

1397
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:22,630
You guys are all very sophisticated and 
complex game players,

1398
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:28,040
you know,
otherwise you couldn't sit here 

1399
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:28,040
peacefully for an hour and a half,
so you're.

1400
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:32,800
You're very well socialized all of you,
and so that means that you've organized 

1401
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,381
all your motivations into a hierarchy 
and that hierarchy is guiding your 

1402
01:14:37,381 --> 01:14:38,680
behavior.
Here it might be something like,

1403
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:39,910
well,
we need to learn something,

1404
01:14:39,911 --> 01:14:42,490
and hypothetically you've come here and 
you learn something,

1405
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:47,260
and so you're playing that out,
and then because that's the motivational

1406
01:14:47,261 --> 01:14:50,950
state that you're in,
when I asked you to do something,

1407
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:55,060
you're just going to do it.
Well then what's so cool is that as soon

1408
01:14:55,061 --> 01:14:58,390
as you decide to point your attention 
out something,

1409
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:03,160
what happens is what you see in the 
world radically transforms,

1410
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,840
you know,
so I say,

1411
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:09,841
well,
count the basketballs and all of a 

1412
01:15:09,841 --> 01:15:09,841
sudden all you can see your basketball.

1413
01:15:09,841 --> 01:15:09,841
So new think no,
no,

1414
01:15:09,841 --> 01:15:10,480
I see I'm not blind.
It's like,

1415
01:15:10,481 --> 01:15:12,910
wow,
you're a pretty damn blind.

1416
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:18,270
And so that's partly how you can 
understand how motivation is a 

1417
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:23,311
subpersonality.
Like it has its whole sets of 

1418
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:24,180
perceptions and values.
It's like all of a sudden we,

1419
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:27,280
I set you up in a little motivated state
was a complicated,

1420
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:28,570
why don't you know,
but it was just like,

1421
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:31,570
here's the task,
and so you're all motivated,

1422
01:15:31,571 --> 01:15:33,620
you're going to do the task properly 
for,

1423
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:37,450
for God only knows how many reasons,
and then all of a sudden all that exists

1424
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:40,000
in the world are basketballs.
Right?

1425
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:44,220
And so that that's,
that's it's as if you're,

1426
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:49,230
your goal directed attention has 
transformed the phenomenology of the 

1427
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:53,191
world and that's something that's really
cool because one of the things that 

1428
01:15:53,191 --> 01:15:56,251
implies is that what you see of the 
world depends on what you're aiming at 

1429
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,890
and in a real sense that this isn't 
something trivial sense.

1430
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:02,650
It means like literally what you're 
aiming at.

1431
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,450
I'm going to count the basketballs.
It means well,

1432
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:10,470
you're not noticing the gorillas.
So one of the things that you might ask 

1433
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:14,131
yourself and this department,
what the phenomenologists were on about 

1434
01:16:14,131 --> 01:16:17,220
is what are you aiming at and what is it
that what you're aiming at allows you to

1435
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:21,070
see and what is it that,
what you're aiming at?

1436
01:16:21,071 --> 01:16:26,071
Blinds,
Youtube and it blinds you to a lot more 

1437
01:16:26,071 --> 01:16:29,401
than it allows you to see.
And so another thing that you can think 

1438
01:16:29,401 --> 01:16:32,521
about is like if everything you see 
makes you angry and bitter and 

1439
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:33,460
resentful,
then you might think,

1440
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:38,461
well,
what exactly am I aiming at that's 

1441
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:39,790
making the world organized itself around
me in that manner?

1442
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,140
And that's,
you know,

1443
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:46,340
that's very.
That would be a complex from a union 

1444
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:46,630
perspective,
a complex would do that.

1445
01:16:46,631 --> 01:16:47,800
So it's a set of values.

1446
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,930
They're sort of economists,
they inhabit you,

1447
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:52,300
it's a subpersonality,
it's quite complex.

1448
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:57,540
It's got something saving yet you might 
not know even what that is because 

1449
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:01,201
you're acting it out instead of 
understanding it and because you're 

1450
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:04,891
inside of it,
it lays the world out for you in a 

1451
01:17:04,891 --> 01:17:04,891
particular way.
It makes you,

1452
01:17:04,891 --> 01:17:09,690
it makes the world look like it's 
showing you that what you think is 

1453
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:09,690
right.
But it's just,

1454
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,420
you know,
if your,

1455
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:12,950
what do they say to the man with a 
hammer?

1456
01:17:12,951 --> 01:17:14,810
Everything looks like a nail.
Right?

1457
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,440
And that's,
that's,

1458
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,220
that's one of the things that's so damn 
cool about that experiment.

1459
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:20,630
It's like,
really?

1460
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:25,460
I'm really that blind.
I could miss something that radical just

1461
01:17:25,461 --> 01:17:28,560
when I'm involved in some dopey task 
like counting basketballs.

1462
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:31,270
It makes me so blind to that.
It's almost beyond comprehension.

1463
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:33,770
Well,
so in some ways,

1464
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:38,771
you know,
you skipped between different states of 

1465
01:17:38,771 --> 01:17:39,140
blindness,
lot of them are biologically motivated.

1466
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:45,130
Then you turn those into a hierarchy and
that sort of your higher value system 

1467
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:48,490
and then that thing points you at 
something and the whole world lays 

1468
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:51,701
itself out around that and the way it 
does is it divides the world and do 

1469
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:55,391
irrelevant things and so those would 
have been the curtains in this 

1470
01:17:55,391 --> 01:17:59,380
particular example or the gorilla or 
even a player in black lift the game 

1471
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:01,040
irrelevant because it didn't interfere 
with you counting.

1472
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,190
So what you look at makes most of the 
world irrelevant.

1473
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:08,600
It makes some things,
things that serve you and that makes you

1474
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,970
feel positive emotion and it makes other
things.

1475
01:18:10,971 --> 01:18:14,090
Things that get in your way and that's 
what makes negative emotions.

1476
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:19,570
And so you've got the hypothalamic 
systems that point you in biological 

1477
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,220
directions.
You organize those and then it's like as

1478
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:27,221
you're approaching the thing,
you're aiming at the positive emotion 

1479
01:18:27,221 --> 01:18:29,200
systems telling you when you're on track
and the negative emotion systems telling

1480
01:18:29,201 --> 01:18:34,201
you when something's interfering and 
those are actually different 

1481
01:18:34,201 --> 01:18:35,810
neurological systems,
so they're not in the hypothalamus.

1482
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:38,120
The positive emotion system is to some 
degree,

1483
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:43,600
but the negative emotion system,
not that evolved later and there's a 

1484
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:43,940
couple of them.
There's one that produces pain,

1485
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:49,240
we'll talk about it more,
and there's another one that produces 

1486
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:50,840
anxiety and so we're also now you kind 
of understand the relationship,

1487
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:53,810
roughly the relationship between 
motivation,

1488
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:57,520
perception and emotion.
No,

1489
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:02,150
they all act together and they're all 
dependent in this weird way in,

1490
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:07,180
on what you're after so that you can 
think about that for 50 years and you 

1491
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,030
won't get to the bottom of it.
You know,

1492
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,070
the Buddhists say that everything is 
illusion,

1493
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:10,730
Maya,
right?

1494
01:19:10,731 --> 01:19:15,731
People live in illusion.
Why is what you're aiming at determines 

1495
01:19:15,731 --> 01:19:18,280
what you see.
So anyways,

1496
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:19,490
it's worth it.
