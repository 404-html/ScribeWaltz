1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:05,960
So

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,650
there's a couple of things I want to 
tell you about today.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,020
Many things I want to tell you about.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,820
I want to tell you,
I'm

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,330
give you a Schema that's going to enable
you to understand.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,690
I think it'll enable you to understand 
stories like the one I told you last 

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,090
time,
you remember Jonah and the whale.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,050
I want to provide you with this Schema 
so that you can understand stories like 

9
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,980
that,
but many,

10
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:39,690
many more stories like that and partly 
what I'm telling you about today in some

11
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:44,670
sense our archetypes and there's a and 
an archetype is isn't.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,120
It's an idea that was made most popular 
over the last hundred years by Carl 

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,890
Young,
but it's a much older idea than that.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,300
It's really a platonic ideas and in some
ways,

15
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,150
and it means it means something like 
fundamental pattern.

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,270
And so an architect can manifest itself 
in different ways.

17
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:02,340
It could be a pattern of emotional 
response.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,110
So that could be something that you're 
feeling.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,160
It could be the way that that emotional 
response displays itself on your body,

20
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:08,910
on your face.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,120
It could be the way that that emotion 
just fields and displays itself on your 

22
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:19,551
face and then plays itself out as a 
drama in your local environment,

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,160
so like an angry argument is an 
archetypal phenomenon and the reason 

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,850
this architectural is because,
well,

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,940
you have one them,
you have them,

26
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:31,380
you have them,
you have them,

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,350
everyone has them,
and so you can't really think about them

28
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:39,351
as individual.
You have to think about them as 

29
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,380
universal and you can't think about them
as something that you create in a sense,

30
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:45,381
although in a sense you do,
but also as something that happens to 

31
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:49,371
you now.
When you read about young and 

32
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:52,250
archetypes,
it's quite confusing because you can 

33
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,520
never be sure whether he's talking about
an instinct and emotion,

34
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,690
a motivational system or a 
subpersonality or the subpersonality 

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,820
within which those things manifest 
itself or even the social drama that's 

36
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,510
being played out in time and space in 
the social world.

37
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,820
But our real archetype,
I would say is all of those things.

38
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:13,821
At the same time.
Now we use archetipal means of 

39
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:17,721
expression to represent how we act and 
that's not the same thing as resent 

40
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,220
representing what the world is made out 
of.

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,860
It's a very different thing and so you 
could say in some sense,

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,730
we tell stories and understand stories 
so that we can figure out how people act

43
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:31,731
and how they should act,
and then we conduct science so that we 

44
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:34,641
can figure out what the world's like 
from a material objective perspective 

45
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:36,510
and the two things coexist.
Uneasily,

46
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,870
I think the more primary form of 
knowledge is actually how to act with 

47
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,730
the scientific model nested inside it 
because the most important question that

48
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:48,420
you have to solve as a living organism 
isn't what the world is made out of.

49
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,570
It's how you should act in the world 
safe from a Darwinian perspective even 

50
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,590
so that you can live long enough to 
reproduce.

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,620
That's basically from a strict 
biological perspective.

52
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:04,621
In some sense.
That's what you have to do in order to 

53
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:04,870
be successful.
It's kind of obvious,

54
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:09,871
first of all,
because you're not very successful if 

55
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:11,050
you just go and die,
and then of course deaths from a genetic

56
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,410
perspective and failing to leave 
offspring are much the same thing,

57
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,530
so now one of the questions might be how
is it that we conceive of the world as a

58
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:28,510
place to act in,
and that's partly,

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,340
I'm going to outline a hypothesis for 
you and then explain the significance of

60
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:38,341
that hypothesis and the hypothesis 
involves the description of what you 

61
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:43,021
might consider constituent elements and 
also transformation processes.

62
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,240
Okay,
so as far as I can tell,

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,600
the constituent elements of the stories 
that we tell about how people acted 

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,010
should act our characters.
Now that makes sense,

65
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,260
right?
Because you really can't have a drama or

66
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,670
a story with characters.

67
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,150
Now the thing is the characters have to 
be understandable and so for them to be 

68
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,220
understandable,
they sort of have to be like you or they

69
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,160
have to be like someone that you know,
but they have to be human.

70
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,250
But then again,
it's not exactly that they're human 

71
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,621
because even when you're telling a story
about what happened to you today,

72
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,750
it's interesting to think about what you
do.

73
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,550
So someone might say,
well,

74
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,680
how was your day?
And you say,

75
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,560
fine.
I mean maybe that's the lowest level,

76
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,580
lowest resolution,
highest abstract story.

77
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:33,670
My Day was fine.
It's pretty boring story.

78
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,820
It's better than terrible I suppose,
but it's not interesting and it's not 

79
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,181
detailed.
But first and gets the notion that 

80
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,180
things went according to what according 
to plan or more specifically the things 

81
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,861
unfolded the way you wanted them to just
not exactly the same as according to 

82
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:52,390
plan because a plan is kind of a cold 
cognitive thing,

83
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,440
you know,
or or,

84
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,120
or expected expectation.

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,160
The cognitive scientists sort of used 
whether,

86
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,250
well while what you,
how you wanted them to implies that you 

87
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,860
have desires and emotions and 
motivations and that they inform the way

88
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:08,770
that you're acting in the world because 
you don't just act in the world.

89
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,340
You Act in the world so that you tried 
to turn it into something better than it

90
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:15,100
is right now.
Assuming you have any sense,

91
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,310
you know,
because some people act on the world to 

92
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,351
make it worse than it is now,
but we're going to forget about those 

93
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:22,570
people for now.
So when you say fine to someone,

94
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:25,570
you basically say,
roughly speaking,

95
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,900
I got what I wanted today without undue 
hassle.

96
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,020
Okay.
So that's a really condensed version of 

97
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,650
the events of the day and it's not a 
very good story,

98
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,950
although it might suffice for casual 
conversation.

99
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,360
Person might say,
no,

100
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:43,800
no,
no,

101
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,980
what did you do today?

102
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,490
And then maybe you'll say,
oh,

103
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:51,520
I woke up this morning and I went to 
university and uh,

104
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:56,521
you know,
the subway took a lot longer than it 

105
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:56,521
usually does.
And so,

106
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,400
you know,
I used that time to do some studying and

107
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,040
then I got to school and I particularly 
don't lecture,

108
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,260
but lunch was really good and I met some
friends.

109
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,570
And so that's kind of a story,
right?

110
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:10,571
And you,
the person that you're talking to might 

111
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:13,440
listen to you.
It's not a particularly compelling 

112
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,940
story,
but it's probably better than fine.

113
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,200
And you might say,
well,

114
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,690
why did you select those elements to 
talk about?

115
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,050
You know,
you didn't talk about how many times you

116
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:26,051
blink your eyes,
the first minute that you woke up and 

117
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,291
you didn't describe the motor movements 
that you used to put your left leg on 

118
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,080
the floor and you didn't describe.

119
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,010
You know what bowl you used for 
breakfast,

120
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,230
and the reason you didn't do that is 
because a,

121
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,660
you don't remember for whatever reason,
and B,

122
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,910
you don't care and neither does your 
listener,

123
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:45,911
but that's the peculiar things that your
listener is going to care about some 

124
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:48,230
things and not care about other things.
And if you're a good storyteller,

125
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,380
you kind of automatically know which of 
those things that you should talk about 

126
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,610
so that you're interesting.
Which of the things you should ignore so

127
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,500
that you're not boring your listener to 
death.

128
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,020
And you also understand that.
They will also understand that.

129
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,280
And but you don't know how you do that.
All you know is that you're trying to 

130
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,050
tell an interesting story and in some 
sense what you're doing is you're trying

131
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:14,051
to reduce a sequence of actions and 
conceptions of exceptional complexity to

132
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:17,570
the just right,
which is like the essential or the moral

133
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:22,571
in some sense and you're trying to 
convey that and the other person is 

134
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:25,781
listening partly because they want to 
indicate that they care for you and 

135
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:25,781
would like to know.

136
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:30,370
They want to stay caught up with your 
ongoing narrative so that they 

137
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,401
understand you and maybe also because 
they might think that they'll gardener 

138
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:37,061
some bit of information factual or 
behavioral that might aid them in some 

139
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:38,060
way.
You know,

140
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:43,061
so and we're doing that to each other 
all the time and we automatically do 

141
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:46,241
this.
We automatically know how to tell 

142
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:47,891
stories.
And so what I'm saying is that even the 

143
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:50,201
person that you describe when you 
describe yourself to someone else isn't 

144
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:54,521
exactly you.
It's some representation of you as a 

145
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:58,130
sort of generic human being that's going
about doing certain kinds of interesting

146
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,950
things in the world.
Or here's a way of thinking about it.

147
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:05,951
Roughly is that you make yourself the 
hero of your own story and so you kind 

148
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:10,730
of know that because when you go to a 
movie and movies are usually romances,

149
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,750
say or hero stories will,
romances or adventures or both roughly 

150
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:15,750
speaking.

151
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,680
Um,
you know,

152
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:21,770
sometimes they turn out well and that's 
a comedy and sometimes they don't turn 

153
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,480
out so well and that's a tragedy.
But when you go there,

154
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,170
what you basically see is a story about 
another person who sort of like you,

155
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,260
who's the hero and what you do is you 
track them through a sequence of 

156
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,501
adventures.
And usually what you track them through 

157
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:38,681
isn't things were good and then they 
stayed good and then at the end they 

158
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:39,890
were still the same as they were at the 
beginning.

159
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:41,030
And good,
you know,

160
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:44,810
because why do you want to watch that?
And you might say,

161
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,730
well you should because isn't that 
pleasant?

162
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:51,731
The person's happy and then they stay 
happy and then they end happy and 

163
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:51,731
everyone's happy.
It's why.

164
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,170
Why isn't that interesting?
But it isn't.

165
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,330
And really what want to see is you 
either see,

166
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,540
you want to see someone get into trouble
and fail in a spectacularly interesting 

167
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,531
way,
or you want to see someone get into 

168
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:07,440
trouble and then overcome it in a 
spectacularly interesting way.

169
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,920
And so there's this idea in the,
in the story that the person has to 

170
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:17,961
undergo some kind of transformation in 
the midst of their travails and efforts 

171
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,080
in order for it to be interesting.
So they have to start in one place.

172
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,870
They have to end up somewhere that's not
so good in a very,

173
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:29,871
very complicated way.
And then maybe by transforming their 

174
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:31,110
character,
by transforming the surroundings are but

175
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:35,310
coming to some sort of realization,
or maybe just by dimwitted luck,

176
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,370
they managed to solve the set of 
problems that emerge triumphant at the 

177
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,580
other end.
Right?

178
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,560
So that's the meaning of Jonah and the 
whale,

179
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,400
or you remember what happens to Jonah is
that he's got this destiny he supposed 

180
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:52,740
to be pursuing.
Any decides that it's too much trouble.

181
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,170
Well,
not unsurprisingly,

182
00:09:55,171 --> 00:10:00,171
because if you remember what he was told
to do was go to tell a whole city that 

183
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:01,950
they were misbehaving,
assuming rightly as he did,

184
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:06,951
that that would not make him pretty 
particularly popular and maybe he'd get 

185
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:08,940
killed and even if he did it,
it would be extraordinarily difficult.

186
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,010
He thought,
there's no damn way I'm doing that.

187
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:16,011
So he denied his destiny and as a 
consequence he fell into the abyss and 

188
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:16,950
was swallowed up,

189
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,930
and then because he repented and decided
to carry on with what he was to carry on

190
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:27,931
with his responsibilities,
the creature of the abyss spitting back 

191
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,440
up and he got to go along his merry way.
Now you might say,

192
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:34,441
well,
nothing like that has ever happened to 

193
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:34,441
you,
but that's wrong.

194
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:35,560
Things like that happen to you all the 
time and you know it.

195
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,210
So here,
here,

196
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,360
here's a couple of examples and you'll 
be able to draw all sorts of examples 

197
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,580
from your own life.
That's the story of betrayal.

198
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,480
For example,
maybe in one of your relatively 

199
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,420
uninformed

200
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,470
flurries,
you ended up establishing a relationship

201
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:59,360
with someone who was really not good for
you.

202
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,440
And that might mean while they just,
it was just a bad personality match or 

203
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,740
it might mean they really weren't good 
for you because you know,

204
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:11,741
you could get pretty unlucky and you can
get tangled up with someone who's very 

205
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:15,101
deceitful and very malevolent and who 
could care less about your maybe who 

206
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:18,521
even wants to hurt you.
And then you can establish a trusting 

207
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:18,890
relationship with them.
Or at least you trust them.

208
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:23,891
And then one day you know,
you find out that they are not who they 

209
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:24,770
said they weren't.
Or even more importantly,

210
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:29,771
they are not who you thought they were.
And so then maybe you're in a committed 

211
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:32,150
relationship and they'd be trained you 
with someone else.

212
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,590
And so then you think,
well,

213
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,450
there you are at home and you're,
you know,

214
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,470
you're perfectly happy about being at 
home and then your partner comes home 

215
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,171
and for one reason or another,
you find out that they're having an 

216
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,290
affair or that they'd be trained you or 
that they'd lied to you.

217
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,180
And some other spectacularly important 
way.

218
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:49,280
And maybe it's a lover and maybe it's a 
family member.

219
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:51,080
Maybe it's assembling and maybe it's a 
friend,

220
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,150
whatever,
it doesn't matter,

221
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,240
and so here's the way of thinking about 
it.

222
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,600
The minute before they come home,
you're in one place and you remember 

223
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,860
places just to place,
right?

224
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,360
A place is a place in time because we 
live in space time.

225
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:11,320
We live in time and place and what that 
means is you can be in the same place in

226
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:16,321
one minute and a completely different 
place in the next minute even if you 

227
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:19,621
haven't even moved and so places a very,
very complicated idea,

228
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,140
so you're sitting at home and you're 
watching oprah and you're perfectly 

229
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,161
content to do that and then the person 
comes home and the bottom of your world 

230
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:32,731
falls out and then all of a sudden 
you're not where you thought you were 

231
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:32,731
in.

232
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,140
It's a really weird place that you are 
now because it's not where you were.

233
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,560
That's for sure,
but you also don't know where it is 

234
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,650
because you don't know who that person 
is.

235
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:46,651
That's in that room with you.
You don't know what your past with them 

236
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:48,940
was or what it meant or anything else 
about it.

237
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:52,180
Because it was predicated on absolute 
misperceptions,

238
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,270
so none of your memories about those 
events are valid even though you have 

239
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,860
them as memories and then you have a 
worst problem,

240
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,630
which is if you're betrayed badly 
enough,

241
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,680
not only are you not going to understand
your immediate past with that person,

242
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,520
oh,
and by the way,

243
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:11,521
your future is also gone.
So that's a big problem as is your 

244
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:12,190
presence has become radically more 
complex,

245
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,060
but it's worse than that because if 
you're really betrayed,

246
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,510
you're also going to think,
who am I that I could be that stupid?

247
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,840
And then you're going to think what is a
human being that they can be that 

248
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,441
corrupt and so not only has the have the
fundamentals being kicked out of the 

249
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:34,411
substructure of your perceptions,
but your notion of what it means to be 

250
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:37,600
you and what it needs to be human 
might've been seriously disrupted.

251
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,510
And you know the thing about that is 
that's a non trivial event.

252
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,690
People call that traumatic it didn't 
like and it's like a physical wound and 

253
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,360
in fact it has.
Certainly if the trauma is great enough,

254
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,170
it can produce a psychophysiological 
wound because that sort of trauma,

255
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,450
a deep betrayal is a good example,
will damage your brain and maybe you'll 

256
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,611
recover from it and maybe you won't.
And one of the ways that that's been 

257
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:07,081
represented forever in mythological 
stories is by being swallowed up by a 

258
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:12,301
subterranean beast.
It's something that comes up from the 

259
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:13,660
depths and pulls you down and then 
you're in it.

260
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,420
Now why is that?
Well,

261
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,050
that's an extraordinarily complicated 
question,

262
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,420
but here,
here's the answer.

263
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:27,421
As nearly as I can tell,
we evolved a very complicated 

264
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:31,000
neuro-psychological system to signal 
alarm.

265
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,070
So that's anxiety,
threat,

266
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,450
threat sensitive,
right?

267
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,190
And that makes us freeze,
for example.

268
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,330
And when you look at how an animal uses 
that system,

269
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:42,490
let's say a mammal,
just to keep it simple because we're all

270
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,560
mammals and so we can kind of understand
mammals.

271
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,710
So if a rabbit sees a wolf,
for example,

272
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,770
it's going to freeze so that the wolf 
camp c and if I,

273
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,860
if a rat smells like cat,
even if it has never smelled a cat and 

274
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,660
it's whole life,
it's going to also freeze.

275
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:01,661
And interestingly with rats,
if you put rats in a natural 

276
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:06,401
environment,
which means they get to help little rat 

277
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:08,470
dominance hierarchies,
a little rap families and they're not 

278
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,470
like little white rats alone in a cage.

279
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,020
They're happy family rats and they've 
got their burrows and they live in their

280
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:17,021
little societies that maybe there is a 
part of their territory where they can 

281
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:20,981
go get food and they're used to that.
So they'll scurry out there in the day 

282
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:21,550
kind of hiding because they don't like 
light.

283
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Or maybe they'll scurry out at night 
because rats are night things and 

284
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,350
they'll get their food and they'll eat 
it or bring it back or whatever they,

285
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,380
whatever they do,
share it with their family or at least 

286
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,380
bring it back.
Well,

287
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,161
let's say that you put a cat out there 
or maybe you even just put a cap there 

288
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:37,310
and take it away.
So that the place smells like cat.

289
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,340
Well,
if one of those rats goes out there and 

290
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,340
sees that cat,
first of all it's going to freeze and it

291
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,080
is not a happy thing because imagine 
you're a rat and a thing that's four 

292
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:50,150
times as big as a lion suddenly appears 
on your front yard.

293
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,410
It's like,
that's rough,

294
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:52,850
man.
You're going to phrase it,

295
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,700
then you're going to go hide downstairs 
and what are you going to do?

296
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,690
Well,
if you're a rat,

297
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,720
you're going to screen for 24 hours,
which is nonstop with your little beak 

298
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,130
poking out of your borough so everyone 
can hear you scream.

299
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,510
And that's the same given the length of 
life as you're screaming nonstop for two

300
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:10,160
weeks.
So like that,

301
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:15,161
racks nervous.
It's not happy about the whole cap 

302
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:16,460
thing.
And then maybe maybe if no more cat odor

303
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:21,461
happens by and no hypervigilant rat see 
any more cats than after it screens for 

304
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,680
two weeks.
It starts to calm down a little bit and 

305
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,530
maybe then it starts to remember that 
it's hungry and that you know,

306
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:30,650
there's things to attend to.
And so then maybe it very,

307
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:34,250
very carefully goes back out where it 
was foraging for food,

308
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:39,251
sort of crunched over and hypervigilant 
to not moving very much in case that 

309
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:39,350
damn cats around.

310
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,460
And then maybe slowly it regains control
over its territory.

311
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,700
It runs back and forth trying to ensure 
that none of that place that used to be 

312
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,960
safe has gone troublesome cats 
associated with it anymore.

313
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,290
And so in some sense,
the bottom fell out of that rats life.

314
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Now the thing is the rat has predator 
detection systems that are associated 

315
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:04,070
with extreme anxiety and escape.
They're automatically activated whenever

316
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:07,130
there's a Predator in sight.
And we have those systems too.

317
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,590
But human beings are.
You might say,

318
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:10,940
well,
okay,

319
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,180
rats have predators,
enemies.

320
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,260
Humans have predators and enemies.
Okay?

321
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:19,580
So then we might say,
well,

322
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,240
what's a human predator slash enemy?
Well,

323
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,960
it depends on how long a period of time 
over which you wish to calculate what 

324
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,710
constitutes human.
Because we know,

325
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:33,260
for example,
that $60 million years ago,

326
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,000
your primary Predator when you were 
wandering around in trees and we're only

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,980
about this big with stakes and so snake 
is a Predator and an enemy and you know,

328
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:47,981
you guys can easily learn how to be 
afraid of snakes and maybe you're 

329
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:47,981
innately afraid of them to begin with.

330
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:52,870
No one.
The science on that is not exactly 

331
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,920
clear,
although it certainly indicates that you

332
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:57,921
could easily learn snake fear and uh,
probably indicates that really it's a 

333
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:58,470
neat.
It's an eight inch chimpanzees.

334
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,450
So why not us,
you know,

335
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,270
it's not that long since we split off 
the evolutionary pathway from the common

336
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,470
chip human ancestor.
So enemies,

337
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,730
snakes.
What else?

338
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,790
How about crocodiles?
Those things pulled a lot of your 

339
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:13,790
ancestors.
Well,

340
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,000
not your ancestors because they got 
pulled under water.

341
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:20,001
But when we were wondering around on the
African Veldt and we went down to the 

342
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:21,630
river to have some water,
you can be sure that a fair number of us

343
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:25,900
got pulled underneath by crocodiles.
And so crocodiles and you know,

344
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,720
those are creepy things.
Crocodiles.

345
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:28,170
Hey,
it'd be.

346
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,440
They figure it nightmares and they 
figure in horror movies and you can 

347
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,680
imagine yourself in Florida now,
there with alligators and thinking,

348
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,410
you know,
it'd be just as well if they didn't come

349
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:42,411
too close to your boat with their little
beady eyes and they're great big teeth 

350
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:42,411
that,
you know,

351
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:45,090
they're unpleasant things.
And then there's lions,

352
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,890
hyenas,
okay.

353
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,910
Another one of those things.
You might take a lion in a Hyena or 

354
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:51,910
different things,
but they're not.

355
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,990
I would say they're large tooth 
mammalian carnivores.

356
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,710
It's like a medic category.
And so they sort of fit in that Predator

357
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:03,711
enemy category and your nervous system 
is prepared to respond to predatory eyes

358
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:09,110
and teeth and no wonder because 
predatory eyes track you down at teeth 

359
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,831
eat you and they bite you.
And so it's a good thing that you're 

360
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:15,300
aware of those and that you can detect 
them rapidly.

361
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,010
Um,

362
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,940
what else is a human enemy?

363
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,190
How about another human?
How would that be?

364
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,580
You think more people have died from 
other humans are from predators?

365
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,110
Well,
I suspect that since we've actually been

366
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:36,510
human,
if that's maybe 150,000

367
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:41,511
years,
because that's about when it appears 

368
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:41,511
that we were more or less genetically 
identical to what we are now.

369
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:44,370
My guess is that humans have got it all 
over predators.

370
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I mean lots of us,
God eat and let's not be too shy about 

371
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,360
discussing that,
but now at least man,

372
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:52,680
it's other people.
Okay,

373
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:55,380
well what about yourself?
How about you as your own enemy?

374
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,980
While?
Well,

375
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,530
then you make it psychological.
Maybe it's not other people may,

376
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,600
but it's the evil in their hearts or 
maybe it's the evil in your hearts.

377
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,040
So you see,
so this is a way of thinking about it,

378
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,690
is that we have a circuit to deal with 
threats,

379
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,590
but the threats exist all the way from 
the primordial biological,

380
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:15,450
like actual predators,
snakes,

381
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,940
all the way up to the incredibly 
abstract.

382
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,940
Like my great enemy is the evil 
intentions that other people harbored 

383
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,970
towards me or that maybe I have in my 
own heart.

384
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,450
Okay?
So that's that entire complex of 

385
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,330
predatory slash threat slash evil 
because it's become psychologize to that

386
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:37,761
point.
That's one of the things that can be a 

387
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:37,890
character in a movie,
and it is right.

388
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,160
It's the antagonist,
it's the adversary that's the,

389
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,400
that's the architectural element.
It's the thing that opposes you in every

390
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:47,320
way and you can locate that in all sorts
of different places,

391
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:49,870
right?
You could have a story about how someone

392
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:52,700
is grappling with their own evil 
impulses up.

393
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,210
What's the name of that serial killer 
thing?

394
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,020
I'm Dexter Dexter's.
Got that problem.

395
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:00,880
People are pretty fascinated by that 
show,

396
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:03,790
right?
A serial killer who can do good,

397
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,980
like sort of like a human being in some 
sense.

398
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,490
You know,
so that's.

399
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:12,530
There's golf,
this psychological barrier between good 

400
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,030
and evil in his heart or maybe the,
maybe the,

401
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,630
the enemy is externalized.
So maybe it's Batman and the joker and 

402
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,170
the joker is a pretty.
The is really a figure of,

403
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,210
of chaotic evil.
Fundamentally,

404
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,400
you know,
in the Best Batman movie,

405
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,360
which was the one with a,
with the joker.

406
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,300
And it wasn't Jack Nicholson who played 
the ledger ledger.

407
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,290
Yeah,
yeah.

408
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,330
Heath Ledger,
you know,

409
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,200
that was rough on old heath and no 
wonder,

410
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:40,201
you know,
because he embodied this archetypal 

411
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:41,740
character and that joker was so much of 
an adversary that he didn't even want to

412
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,090
win,
right?

413
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,900
You can understand adversaries that want
to,

414
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:48,520
when its adversaries that want to make 
everyone lose,

415
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:51,520
that are really hard to understand,
and that's part of what made that movie,

416
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,860
you know,
relatively striking and memorable.

417
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:55,780
And he really embodied that character 
well.

418
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,220
And so one,
here's two sets of characters that make 

419
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,720
up stories,
hero and address Siri,

420
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,250
okay?

421
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,840
So,
and you can,

422
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,750
you can understand that at multiple 
levels simultaneously.

423
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,840
Um,
here's another set of characters.

424
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,870
Now,
here's why I think these characters are 

425
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,300
fundamental elements of our cognitive 
structure caught cognitive substructure.

426
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,280
First of all,
I think that really what we want to know

427
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:23,410
is not what is,
but we want to know how to act,

428
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,410
how to conduct ourselves in the world.
We're moving creatures,

429
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:31,411
right?
We don't just sit there on a rock and 

430
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:32,740
filter seawater through our guilt.
We have to go out there and contend with

431
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:34,690
the world.
And so we need to know how to do that,

432
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,810
we need to know how to do it and how not
to do it.

433
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:40,630
So we can look for good examples and we 
can look for bad examples.

434
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,900
We don't want just any old good example.
We want a good example that's boiled 

435
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,831
right down to excellent example and we 
want a bad example that's boiled right 

436
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:50,470
down to excellent bad example.

437
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,830
And so a good example would be a 
character who is an amalgam of all the 

438
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:00,181
good things about good people and an 
evil character would be an announcement 

439
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:02,740
of all evil things about bad people and 
the more pure in some sense,

440
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:07,741
in essence,
both of those characters are the more 

441
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:10,111
architects of the story.
And so an archetypal story is good 

442
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:10,900
versus evil and you might think you 
don't believe in good versus evil,

443
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,930
but it doesn't really matter what you 
believe because when you go to movies,

444
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:17,200
you watch that and you watch it as if 
you believe it.

445
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,710
And I would say this is an existential 
claim by the way,

446
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,230
is that it doesn't matter what you say 
you believe,

447
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:28,231
because what do you know about what 
matters is how you act out what you 

448
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:32,101
believe,
and if you really want to find out what 

449
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:32,380
you believe,
you don't ask yourself what you believe.

450
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,620
You Watch yourself act and you did those
from that what you believe.

451
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,440
And so if you don't believe,
for example,

452
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:44,620
in a good versus evil architectural 
struggle and what are you doing?

453
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:47,240
Watching wars,
for example.

454
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:52,660
Okay,
because obviously that's an archetypal 

455
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,761
story,
just like Harry Potter is an archetypal 

456
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:54,761
story.
And both of those are archetypal stories

457
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:55,760
about good versus evil.
Okay?

458
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,120
Next set of categories.
So imagine that we've been living in 

459
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,240
familial groups for who knows how long,
let's say 3 million years.

460
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,860
Just for the sake of argument.
We were living in tribal groups way,

461
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,450
way longer than that.
You know,

462
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:19,470
if,
if you think about a tribal group at 

463
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,191
something that might extend back farther
than chimpanzees were living in 

464
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:23,480
dominance hierarchies for way longer 
than tribal groups,

465
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:28,481
but the family group,
you got to think we'd be living in 

466
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:32,351
family groups for about as long as we've
been extraordinarily dependent as 

467
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:35,210
infants and as long as we've had really 
large brains.

468
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,050
And so again,
that's why you can't draw,

469
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,810
you know,
pipeline.

470
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,830
But because we'd been getting bigger and
bigger brains for quite a long time,

471
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,520
but it's,
it's in the millions of years let's say.

472
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:49,640
And so,
and the other thing that you might think

473
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:52,520
about is that you know,
your cognitive apparatus,

474
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:57,521
your perceptual apparatus to your 
emotional apparatus has originated 

475
00:24:57,521 --> 00:25:01,931
within an environment.
Obviously now we tend to think of the 

476
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:03,140
environment as the natural environment.
And then we tend to think of the natural

477
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:07,480
environment is like a forest.
But the natural environment for primates

478
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,610
say is only forest to some degree.
I mean,

479
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:15,611
first of all,
we didn't just dwell in forests because 

480
00:25:15,611 --> 00:25:18,131
we were also veldt dwelling creatures,
but also we didn't really dwell among 

481
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,260
trees.
We dwelled among other primates like us,

482
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,060
and so our primary environment is 
actually other people and then you might

483
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:26,690
say,
okay,

484
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,840
what are the fundamental categories of 
the other people?

485
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,180
Well,
how about mother?

486
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,500
That's a big one because the probability
that you had a mother,

487
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,550
it's like it's up there at about 100 
percent.

488
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,750
You know,
and if there wasn't even if you're new,

489
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,160
you lost your biological mother at 
birth.

490
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:46,850
If someone didn't fulfill the archetypal
role as mother,

491
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
then you don't live and that doesn't 
just mean providing you with food and 

492
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,020
water and shelter.
Because if you provide a child under one

493
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,170
with food and water and shelter and 
that's it,

494
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,930
they die.
You have to pick them up,

495
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:02,870
you have to touch them.
You have to rock them back and forth.

496
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,990
You have to communicate with them.
If you don't give them physical 

497
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,410
attention,
their nervous systems shut down and they

498
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:14,411
die.
And so that's part of the reason why in 

499
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:17,200
well in eastern European orphanages,
orphanages before the wall fell down,

500
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,840
the death rate,
especially in places like Romania in the

501
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,490
orphanage,
is it's an awful story,

502
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,380
was unbelievably high.

503
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:29,380
And if the kids didn't die,
they were just so crippled 

504
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,541
psychologically that they never 
recovered and that was because people 

505
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:31,541
didn't touch them and didn't interact 
with them.

506
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:36,430
And so you need a creature playing out 
the architectural role of mother to 

507
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:40,730
entice you into life.
Otherwise you just perish.

508
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,710
So mother,
that's a category man.

509
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,990
And then well,
fathers to category two and it's the 

510
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,450
same thing applies there.
And even if you don't have a father,

511
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,450
there's a male power structure around 
you,

512
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,370
a dominance hierarchy,
roughly speaking,

513
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,640
that acts in the paternal role.
And there's no getting away from that 

514
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:02,430
unless you don't live in a society.
And then if you don't live in a society,

515
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,740
then you just die because you can't live
by yourself.

516
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,730
So father and mother are primary 
categories.

517
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:12,420
And then there's the primary category of
the individual because wherever you are,

518
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:13,350
there you are.

519
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,950
And that's been the case for every human
being that's ever existed.

520
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,040
So the fundamental categories are 
individual,

521
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,390
mother and father.
And there's another fundamental category

522
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:29,391
which we alluded to,
which is horrible thing that lives at 

523
00:27:29,391 --> 00:27:29,391
the bottom of a pit that will devour 
you.

524
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,090
And that has a psychological reality,
objective,

525
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:33,960
reality,
and that's,

526
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:38,961
as I said,
that's equivalent to the story of Jonah 

527
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:38,961
being gobbled up by the whale.
That happens.

528
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:41,910
That sort of story is very common.
Pinocchio is a story like that,

529
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,480
right?
Pinocchio has an existential problem.

530
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,600
He doesn't know how to be a real boy.
It turns out that in order to become a 

531
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,201
real boy,
we might regard that as a fully 

532
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:56,781
developed individual.
He has to go down to the bottom of the 

533
00:27:56,781 --> 00:27:56,781
ocean,
into a whale,

534
00:27:56,781 --> 00:27:59,280
and rescue his father.
Well,

535
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,200
you,
it doesn't take a lot of imagination to 

536
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,840
see the kinship between that story and 
the story of Jonah.

537
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,200
It's the same story.
Jonah had to reestablish his 

538
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,171
relationship with God the father in 
order to successfully make a passage 

539
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:20,241
from aimless and disobedient character 
to someone who was alive on shore and 

540
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:24,540
pursuing a particular path.
It's the same motif.

541
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:25,200
It's a very,
very,

542
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:30,201
very common motif.
And the reason for that is that that's 

543
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:31,860
how people transform.
You know,

544
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:36,861
they hit an obstacle of some sort that 
just blows them into pieces and they go 

545
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,610
down into the depths,
into the abyss and they lived down there

546
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:45,600
for awhile and it's not pleasant and 
maybe they learn something while they're

547
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:50,601
down there if they're lucky and they get
back up and that's the story of human 

548
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:52,500
development.
You never learn something without having

549
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:57,501
something small die and sometimes you 
learn something and something big dies 

550
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:02,450
and then you know,
you put yourself back together and you 

551
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,060
pick up the pieces and you emerge 
unscathed,

552
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,490
hopefully in perhaps transformed and you
carry on.

553
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,490
And so the human developmental story 
isn't an upward march in a linear 

554
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:12,360
manner.
You know,

555
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:15,900
up on even slope.
It's perhaps upwards and onwards,

556
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,990
but it's like this,
it's punctuated by catastrophes.

557
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,200
And of course you guys know that because
obviously,

558
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,310
I mean how many times,
how many people in this room have been 

559
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,160
seriously unhappy at one point in their 
life for more than two weeks.

560
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:35,690
Okay.
Is there anyone who hasn't had that 

561
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:35,690
experience breathing?
Yes.

562
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,580
Have you not had that experience?
Oh yeah.

563
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:39,090
Oh,
sorry.

564
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:42,520
I thought you raised your hand.
Has Anybody had that experience?

565
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,010
Okay.
Okay.

566
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:48,310
So maybe not you.
Well,

567
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:49,870
that's good.
Congratulations.

568
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,800
That's really amazing.

569
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,820
So it's coming.
So yeah.

570
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,500
Yeah.
So,

571
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,370
so the thing is,
you know here,

572
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,220
here's one way of looking at it.
That's reality.

573
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,280
Reality is that you're,
your environment is punctuated by 

574
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:17,080
desense your pathways punctuated by 
descent and when you're ascending,

575
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,090
that's one place.
And when you're descending and at the 

576
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:22,130
bottom,
that's another place.

577
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:27,131
And I can tell you that and this will 
help you with your interpretation of 

578
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:29,981
stories,
is that the times when you descend is 

579
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:31,100
equivalent to a voyage to the 
underworld.

580
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,100
That's what a voyage to the underworld 
means and mythology.

581
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,760
The bottom has fallen out and down you 
go and you know,

582
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:41,120
this sort of thing because look,
if I say we're all skating on thin ice,

583
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,490
like is there anybody here who doesn't 
know what that means?

584
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,380
Okay.
So what does it mean?

585
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,250
What does it mean to break?

586
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,980
The ice can fall out in anytime and then
what happens down?

587
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,000
You Go,
right?

588
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:00,590
And it's cold down there.
Yeah.

589
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:02,960
Maybe you don't get back up.
Yeah.

590
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:07,961
And it's the sort of story that sort of 
sends a chill down your spine and it 

591
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:11,921
should because that's life.
And so one of the things that I really 

592
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:16,181
like about advanced personality theory 
is that it takes that into account and 

593
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:16,181
says,
yeah,

594
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:16,181
yeah,
that's life.

595
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:18,350
Okay,
now that we've established that,

596
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,580
what do we do?
And so then it becomes something like 

597
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,911
this.
It's not so much how do you stop 

598
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:30,050
yourself from descending and ascending 
because good luck with that,

599
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,290
but since you're going to have to do 
that,

600
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:38,470
how do you do it?
And so part of the reason that I called 

601
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,380
this course personality and its 
transformations is because one,

602
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,160
one thing that you can learn about 
yourself as who you are,

603
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:48,190
and that's really useful,
but the other thing that you can learn 

604
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,090
about yourself is how it is that you can
conduct yourself across time.

605
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,290
And that means you're going to have to 
conduct yourself so that you can weather

606
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:59,291
storms.
And some of those might be you make a 

607
00:31:59,291 --> 00:31:59,291
mistake in the ice breaks,
you know?

608
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,430
And some of it is,
yeah,

609
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,470
the ice breaks and it's no mistake at 
all,

610
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,660
it's just how it is,
you know,

611
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:10,661
so when you're one of your parents 
developed Alzheimer's disease for 

612
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:13,631
example,
but you could say that's your mistake 

613
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:13,631
because you're not smart enough to do 
anything about it and you know,

614
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,110
be a better clue in because otherwise 
the disease is going to continue.

615
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:23,290
But on the other hand,
really thinking about it as a personal 

616
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,111
fault seems inappropriate.
It's just a catastrophe that's 

617
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,830
associated with being alive.
And that's what life is,

618
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,300
you know?
And so one of the things you see,

619
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:34,301
for example,
in all of the major trends of religious 

620
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:37,751
thinking all around the world and talk 
about religious thinking because those 

621
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:37,760
are the deepest kinds of stories.

622
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,800
That's really what makes them,
by the way,

623
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,890
it's always the same message.
Life is suffering.

624
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,980
And the reason for that is because we 
skate on thin ice.

625
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,060
Okay?
And you can say,

626
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:52,061
well,
we should pick up the damn ice and fair 

627
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:52,061
enough,
you know?

628
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:52,061
Right.
Definitely.

629
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:54,560
But you should also prepare yourself to 
swim so that when you fall in,

630
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:59,561
you don't die.
So now the job story has a hint or two 

631
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,250
in it,
you know,

632
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,460
so the first thing that happens is job 
is in some sense called the action now 

633
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,200
because that's an old story because it's
a primarily Judaeo Christian and 

634
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,471
religious story.
The call to action takes the force of a 

635
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:15,440
divine command.
Right now you might think,

636
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:20,441
well,
there's such a thing exist and it's a 

637
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:23,981
silly question in some ways because 
whether or not something exists depends 

638
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:26,540
on what you mean by exist,
you know,

639
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:30,380
and that can vary with your 
philosophical presuppositions,

640
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,800
but it also,
it also varies on why you're asking the 

641
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,620
question and where you're looking for 
the answer.

642
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,740
So for example,
here's an example.

643
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,740
Do you believe that there are things 
that you shouldn't do?

644
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,970
Like is there anyone here who doesn't 
believe that?

645
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:55,750
Or more importantly,
is there anyone here who doesn't act 

646
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,091
like they believe it?
So you wake up in the morning and you 

647
00:33:58,091 --> 00:33:58,091
think,
yeah,

648
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:00,851
there's a bunch of things I should do,
or are there some things I should do 

649
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:04,301
next week?
Are there some things I should do with 

650
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:04,301
my life?
Yes,

651
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:06,020
that's a common thought.
Is anyone not think that way?

652
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,290
Okay,
so you know,

653
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:11,080
if you're not thinking that way,
you end up pretty depressed because then

654
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:11,530
you think,
well,

655
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:16,531
there's nothing I should do with my life
and that's not such a happy thought 

656
00:34:16,531 --> 00:34:17,890
because life is hard and then if there's
nothing to do with this wall,

657
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:22,980
all you're they're stuck with is a bunch
of suffering and that doesn't seem like 

658
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,440
a very good idea.
Okay,

659
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:24,400
so then you might say,
well,

660
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:26,140
what exactly does should mean?

661
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:33,930
Well,
it means that you have a moral 

662
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:33,930
obligation of some sort.
You might say,

663
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,070
well,
you decided that yourself and the answer

664
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:39,220
that it's like no wrong.
You haven't decided that you yourself,

665
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:41,980
are you kidding?
You'd be at a complete psychopath if you

666
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:44,080
decided that by yourself,
right?

667
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,910
I mean,
if you're even the Vegas civilized,

668
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:52,170
then you decide what it is that you 
should do or what you should do 

669
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:56,461
manifests itself within you as a context
of a dialogue that you're continually 

670
00:34:56,461 --> 00:35:01,081
having with yourself,
but also with everyone around you and 

671
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:04,321
not only only with everyone around you,
but with the entire history of mankind 

672
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,630
because we're all historical creatures 
and you know what you think you should 

673
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:14,341
do is been shaped by what your parents 
think of that was shaped by what their 

674
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:16,840
parents thought that was shaped by what 
their parents thought and so on.

675
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,970
Back into the depths of history as far 
back as you can possibly imagine,

676
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
both historically and biologically.
So in some sense there is a call to 

677
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,400
action within people.
Now,

678
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:33,401
you know,
in any sort of quest story like the 

679
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:33,401
Hobbit,
let's say,

680
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:34,870
or the Lord of the rings for that 
matter.

681
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:40,110
You know,
the story always starts with a call to 

682
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,110
action,
right?

683
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,370
For some reason or another,
the little hobbit character,

684
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:42,940
which by the way is,
you know,

685
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,870
the hobbits live in this little 
protected place and they're not very big

686
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:50,871
and they're not very smart and they 
don't know about the wide world beyond 

687
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:54,441
the board of the great forces of good 
and evil are at combat and one hobbit 

688
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:58,491
who's a little bit more adventurous than
the rest gets called act gets called 

689
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:01,790
upon to act and in harbord stories,
it's usually the wizard who manages it,

690
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,040
right?

691
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,040
So it's a magical figure of some sort.
He's extraordinarily wise and 

692
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,050
extraordinarily old who might as well be
gone for all intents and purposes,

693
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:10,860
who says,
you know,

694
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,170
it's time for you to go and become a 
thief.

695
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,730
Will.
That's what happens in the Hobbit,

696
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:19,790
right?
Because very weird thing because 

697
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,040
obviously that's Frodo,
right?

698
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,650
Photos,
the hobbit in the Hobbit,

699
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:24,420
and Bilbo is the hobbit and the Lord of 
the rings.

700
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,590
If I remembered the other way around.
Bilbo is the poverty in the hobbit.

701
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,550
Fine,
Bilbo.

702
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,940
Okay,
so bill will gets called to action and 

703
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,000
he's gonna go,
he's gonna.

704
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,280
Go find a dragon.
The dragon is the same thing,

705
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:43,281
that swallow job,
it's the same story and the Jew and the 

706
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:43,710
dragon has a treasure,
which is a weird thing.

707
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:45,240
It's like what's up with dragons,
right?

708
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,370
What do they hoard?
Virgins.

709
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,250
That's the St George Story.
It's a very,

710
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:55,251
very old story or goal and that's weird 
behavior for a predatory lizard,

711
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,050
but anyways,
you accept that without any problem with

712
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,080
course,
a dragon lives underground in a big 

713
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,080
mountain that was excavated by doors and
sits on a treasure.

714
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,120
It's like we go to.
We don't have any problem with that 

715
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,120
idea.
Well,

716
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,280
why fate?
I mean really,

717
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,190
you really believe that?
And the answer is well,

718
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:13,350
well enough to read the damn book and to
make the.

719
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,560
I mean,
how many people went and watched the 

720
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Lord of the Rings?
How many people?

721
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,450
And think about it worldwide.
How much money did a Harry Potter 

722
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,110
generate?
You know,

723
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:30,111
I bet to Harry Potter generated more 
money than the remaining steel mills in 

724
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:35,121
Britain.
If you calculated it across the amount 

725
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:36,960
of time since those stories emerged,
right?

726
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,460
So of course there's a lizard in a 
predatory lizard and Harry Potter too.

727
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:46,461
It's the thing that skitters around 
underneath hogwarts and turns you to 

728
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:46,461
stone with the glance of it.
I.

729
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:48,540
Oh,
and does that Lizard Hoard vergence?

730
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,400
Well,
what's the name of the woman that.

731
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:57,401
The girl that he kidnaps Jenny.
Right.

732
00:37:58,101 --> 00:37:59,690
Okay.
What's the word?

733
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:02,480
Jenny?
From Virginia.

734
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,330
Right.
Good.

735
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:10,870
Good.
And she's Harry's first month interest 

736
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,590
and he rescues her from the damn snake 
and he gets parallels.

737
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,210
Won't paralyze,
wouldn't while he's doing it.

738
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,420
What rescue is?
Harry Phoenix,

739
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,300
right?
A Phoenix.

740
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,480
Okay.
So the Bass Bites Harry and so he's 

741
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,480
going to die.
The Phoenix comes along.

742
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,560
Who owns the Phoenix?
Dumbledore.

743
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:29,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

744
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:34,380
What does the Phoenix do?
Cries and cries into Harry's wounds.

745
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,820
Yes.
What happens then?

746
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:39,070
What happens to Harry?
He comes back to life.

747
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,730
Death and resurrection story.
So the thing that's willing to die and 

748
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,140
resurrect is the thing that gets the 
virgin from the snake.

749
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,270
It's like,
does that make sense?

750
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,960
Well,
you think it makes sense even though you

751
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:55,700
don't really know why it makes sense.
And then what happens to the what?

752
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,780
Ams to the Phoenix after it does that 
Burns itself up in a puff of flame and 

753
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:07,801
is reborn,
so it's the story told twice the thing 

754
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:10,771
that dies in Israel.
Reborn is the thing that conquers the 

755
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:14,170
serpentine and and rescues the feminine 
roughly speaking.

756
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,520
So it's not gold in that situation,
but it doesn't matter.

757
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,650
It's the same story.
It's always the same story.

758
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,380
So,
and when you don't hear that story,

759
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:28,381
like when your culture isn't providing 
you with rich stories of that sort that 

760
00:39:28,381 --> 00:39:29,170
are derived directly from your 
tradition.

761
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,380
Somebody like an unemployed welfare 
mother in Britain has it pop up full 

762
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:39,511
fledged into her brilliant imagination 
and lays out seven books and makes 

763
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:40,990
herself more money than the queen.
Right?

764
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,780
Right.
And that,

765
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,120
you know,
it's a cinderella story.

766
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:46,720
It's a bloody amazing story.
And then there's all those books and all

767
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:48,520
those kids learn to read because of the 
books.

768
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:53,521
And then there's all those movies and 
everybody goes and sees them and no one 

769
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:56,521
notices that they don't know what the 
hell they're doing while they're doing 

770
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:56,770
it.
And it follows the same old story.

771
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Alright,
so you've got your individual that's 

772
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,520
you,
the hero,

773
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,970
then you got the adversary to that.

774
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,700
That's your enemy.
Wherever that enemy might happen to me,

775
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,310
that's the forces that oppose oppose 
you,

776
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:11,770
but mostly psychological forces of one 
form or another.

777
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,080
Then you've got the father.
Well,

778
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,260
there's two kinds of fathers.
What guy?

779
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,640
Good for others and bad fathers.
So here's an example.

780
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,820
I'm the lion king.
So the lion king as a father,

781
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,660
right?
A asa and asa has a brother who's his 

782
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:40,000
brother scar and what's up with scar?
Not a pleasant guy.

783
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,590
Partly maybe because he's scarred 
sometimes.

784
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,120
Ha.
Well really a,

785
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,320
he's kind of skinny.
He said he came from the shallow end of 

786
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,291
the gene pool.
Obviously something's happened to him 

787
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:52,780
because he has this scar.
He's arrogant and brilliant,

788
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:57,310
which is very common set of attributes 
for negative father figures and he's out

789
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:59,350
to doing the cane.
Right?

790
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:01,270
So what does he represent?
Well,

791
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,840
you could say,
here's a way of thinking about it 

792
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:06,840
sociologically.

793
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,330
One of the things you hear very 
frequently,

794
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,460
I'm sure many of you have heard this ad 
Nauseum,

795
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:11,440
is that there's such a thing as the 
patriarchy,

796
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,120
right?
The patriarchy,

797
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:13,550
while.
Okay.

798
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:17,710
The Petro Patriarchy is a mythological 
construct and I mean that,

799
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:23,010
I mean that technically speaking,
you have a paternal figure that 

800
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:28,261
basically represents it can represent 
the father directly or it can represent 

801
00:41:28,261 --> 00:41:30,070
the structure of male power.
It's not just male power,

802
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,930
but whatever for for the time being,
we'll,

803
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:37,130
we'll stick with that.
It has a positive aspect which is why 

804
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,390
you get to sit here and you're not being
snowed on and freezing to death.

805
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,580
So that's the positive element and it 
has a negative element and the negative 

806
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,340
element is the arbitrary tyranny that's 
associated with any social organization.

807
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:47,300
Right.
So,

808
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:52,301
okay.
What do you think of the u of t like 

809
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:52,970
your first year?
Did you enjoy it?

810
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,360
How many people didn't enjoy it?
Okay.

811
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,060
How many people did enjoy it?
All right,

812
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,470
so mark,
by the looks of things,

813
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:06,530
some of you and some of you are neutral.
You either enjoyed it or,

814
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,180
or didn't enjoy it or you don't have the
mental energy to crank your arm,

815
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,970
so.
Okay.

816
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,640
So mostly you didn't enjoy it.
What the hell are you doing here?

817
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:19,130
They're like,
what?

818
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:24,131
Why bother?
So someone who didn't enjoy it as 

819
00:42:24,131 --> 00:42:24,440
answered me that maybe you really didn't
enjoy it,

820
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,450
but here you are.
Why are you still here?

821
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,900
That's the sunk cost answer.
It's like you,

822
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,890
you waited for a bus for half an hour.
It hasn't shown up.

823
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,320
The right thing to do is wait for 
another half an hour.

824
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:39,680
Right.

825
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,660
Well,
to put it in the morning,

826
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:49,250
I approached it from a different angle.
So basically I change when I was 

827
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:49,250
starting.

828
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,270
How would that work?
Worked out well,

829
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,260
was it the second time?
I did try it.

830
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:53,450
It worked out well.
Good.

831
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:55,610
Good.
So was that an unpleasant process?

832
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,060
Were you confused?
Did you come out the other end?

833
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,370
Um,
yeah,

834
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,740
right on.
You more mature.

835
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:04,700
Uh,
yeah.

836
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,530
You know more than you did five years 
ago.

837
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,060
I hope so.
Was it worth it?

838
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,570
I hope so.
Good.

839
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:12,680
Good for you.
Good for you.

840
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:13,430
Well Look,
look,

841
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:16,730
you make a calculation and what's wrong 
with the University of Toronto?

842
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,970
Well there's 60,000
students for a starter.

843
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:22,710
Like what the Hell do you matter?
You know,

844
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,900
really your numbered and it feels like 
that a lot of the time.

845
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:32,540
So it's a very impersonal institution 
and you're sort of tossed into it so 

846
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,971
you're basically facing a giant of some 
magnitude who's kind of blind and who 

847
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:41,750
sort of archaic,
which is always what culture is,

848
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:41,920
right?

849
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,530
Culture is always blind because it's a 
product of yesterday and it's.

850
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,260
And it's archaic,
it's not up to date,

851
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:53,740
so you're going to have a problem with 
it and you have that problem when you 

852
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,730
come to the university.
So you stick with it though because it's

853
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,980
got two faces.
One face is sank or swam there guys.

854
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:05,770
And the other face is man,
if you're careful and you and establish 

855
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,740
a relationship with this kind of 
institution,

856
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,700
you can learn so much that you won't 
even be the same person when you come 

857
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,631
out.
Maybe you'll be able to think that'd be 

858
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:16,631
good.
You know,

859
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:21,270
if you learn to think,
then you don't run into sharp things 

860
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,531
when you wander through life because 
you're smart enough to see where they 

861
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:23,531
are and avoid them,
you know,

862
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:27,310
and maybe you can think your way to a 
target or maybe you could even think 

863
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:31,091
about a target that's worthwhile and you
can figure out how to attain it and 

864
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:34,180
maybe you learn to write and then you 
can articulate your ideas and you can 

865
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,530
express them with some power and you 
could make,

866
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,450
you know,
you can be a positive force in the world

867
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:38,490
and you can be successful in all sorts 
of ways.

868
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:43,490
And if you have to put up with being 
tyrannized by a half dad monster,

869
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:46,020
with,
with Alzheimer's disease,

870
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,080
that's blind.
Well that's life and it could be a lot 

871
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,071
worse because at least you're contending
with something that has a positive 

872
00:44:55,071 --> 00:44:55,560
element.
You know,

873
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:57,920
in lots of societies if you're up 
against the,

874
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,380
the blind giant of society,
the best that you can hope for is that 

875
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,740
it isn't running around trying to stomp 
on you all the time.

876
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,880
And I would say that's more the standard
human experience.

877
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,360
So yeah,
there's a patriarchy and yet it's 

878
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:14,360
negative.
Obviously it's always been like that,

879
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,591
but by the same token,
you know there's a good guy embedded in 

880
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:21,711
that too,
and that's the thing you want to have a 

881
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:21,711
relationship with and that's the same 
old story.

882
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:25,941
It's always been like that.
There's always a wise king and tyrant 

883
00:45:25,941 --> 00:45:27,230
and they're always fighting and 
sometimes the wise king,

884
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,180
king winds,
sometimes the tyrant winds and then when

885
00:45:30,181 --> 00:45:35,181
the tire,
when it's up to the hero to defeat the 

886
00:45:35,181 --> 00:45:36,960
tyrant and reestablish the rightful 
king,

887
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:42,110
and that's actually what you're trying 
to do when you're in university because 

888
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:45,831
the rightful king in some senses,
a corpse that's embedded inside the 

889
00:45:45,831 --> 00:45:47,280
university and your job is to revivify 
it.

890
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,760
You know,
you're the living element of the 

891
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:52,760
university and all the knowledge is 
dead.

892
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,300
It's just lying around and some of it's 
out of date.

893
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,500
You know,
you come in here and you,

894
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:00,710
you revise it so that society can 
continue and so that you can benefit 

895
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,040
from the relationship.
Well,

896
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:04,260
that's the positive and negative.
Great father,

897
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:08,100
the king and the tyrant.
And then another,

898
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:12,360
another level is the feminine.
The Feminine is not women.

899
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,240
Women partake of the feminine and the 
masculine,

900
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:18,120
just like men partake of the feminine 
and the masculine,

901
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,870
but the maternal element,
the feminine elements is nature.

902
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,960
Positive nature.
Well,

903
00:46:24,961 --> 00:46:26,820
that's the thing that the 
environmentalists love,

904
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:29,790
right?
That's flowers and French landscapes and

905
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,260
you know,
pleasant days,

906
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:35,910
picnic in the park and and beautiful 
sunshine and fresh air and clean water.

907
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:39,690
But then there's another side.
Another side is,

908
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,550
do you know what the Guinea worm is?

909
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,370
Does anybody know what a Guinea word is?
Well,

910
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:49,371
I'm going to tell you,
although you're not going to be happy 

911
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:51,711
about it,
so a Guinea worm is this horrible 

912
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:52,680
parasite that burrows under the skin,
mostly of children,

913
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,500
mostly in Africa,
and it's about two feet long,

914
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:58,920
so it makes these coils around their 
legs and then it'll poke its little head

915
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:03,921
out and then you can pull it out,
but it tends to break and if that 

916
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:03,921
happens,
then it gets infected.

917
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:08,751
It May,
maybe you die and so you can wrap it 

918
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:08,751
around a pencil very slowly and pull it 
out.

919
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:13,670
That's nature.
Now there's a doctor who's a Canadian 

920
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:17,211
doctor who wasn't really very happy 
about those Damn Guinea worms and he's 

921
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:18,390
just about eradicated them and like 
hooray for him,

922
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,840
but you know,
when we're talking about the 

923
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,281
environment,
especially when we're thinking about it 

924
00:47:25,281 --> 00:47:25,281
and mythological categories and we're 
talking about nature,

925
00:47:25,281 --> 00:47:25,990
it's like,
yeah,

926
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
yeah,
it's nature and all its beneficial 

927
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,321
glory,
but it's also all the things that would 

928
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:35,581
just assume,
eat you in the most awful possible way 

929
00:47:35,581 --> 00:47:38,550
and you need to know that too,
because if you think of nature has only 

930
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:41,710
been official in its positive archetypal
element that that's mother nature in all

931
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:46,711
her glory,
then you tend to denigrate the utility 

932
00:47:46,711 --> 00:47:46,711
of the positive element of culture.

933
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,380
You know it's culture that protects you 
from the horrible elements of nature.

934
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,750
You wouldn't even be able to think 
about.

935
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:56,890
Nature is beautiful if you weren't 
already so protected from it.

936
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:02,230
You know you're more protected from it 
than any human beings ever have been 

937
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:06,930
anywhere in the entire history of life.
And so in this unbelievably protected 

938
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:08,680
environment,
you can think,

939
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:11,680
oh well we should go easy on nature 
because isn't it so beautiful?

940
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:12,760
It's like,
yeah,

941
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:14,650
well,
yes and no.

942
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:20,130
And it's not all beauty.
It's certainly not because nature will 

943
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,870
eventually kill you.
So it even if it doesn't go well,

944
00:48:21,871 --> 00:48:24,070
it's going to kill you.
It will also make you sick.

945
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,880
It will also make everyone that you know
sick and it will kill all of them too.

946
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,930
So it's not so such a bad thing to have 
a little bit of empathy for human beings

947
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:33,670
given that we have to contend with that.

948
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,710
And you know,
if we're destroying everything,

949
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:38,830
which we're not,
it's also returning the favor.

950
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,170
So.
Alright,

951
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,780
so there's the sub stripe at the bottom 
of things.

952
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:46,510
There's this terrible monster,
but it hoards gold.

953
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,400
And so encountering it,
defeating it,

954
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:53,430
challenging it,
facing it can be unbelievably 

955
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:57,630
productive.
And that's a symbol of the absolute 

956
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,391
unknown.
That's where you go when things fall 

957
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:00,391
apart,
you don't know where you are.

958
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:02,110
So where are you?
You're aware,

959
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:04,900
you don't know what things are.
And that's a place.

960
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,580
And what's interesting about it is that 
there are rules to act in that place and

961
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:12,160
that's what's so helpful because you 
know,

962
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:16,600
if you're in a place that you don't know
what to do and that's that you're done.

963
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,990
But if there's a pattern to what you can
do in a circumstance like that,

964
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:25,000
then in July and on your feet and you're
ready to contend and maybe the trip down

965
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:27,910
into the underworld is something you can
undertake on your own accord.

966
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:33,030
And you can come back with the treasurer
and steadying instead of ending up as 

967
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,390
dragon food or worse.
And then when you're conceptualizing 

968
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,840
your relationship to other people,
well,

969
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,090
well let's say this society,
first of all,

970
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:40,660
it's like,
yeah,

971
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:43,180
obviously you face a tyrant.
Of course you do.

972
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,480
But that is all you face.
And you need to be grateful for what 

973
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,780
you've been given by your culture.
And you actually have to understand what

974
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:54,730
that culture is because it's you.
And if you don't rescue that part of you

975
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:59,731
and that part of the culture that 
everything gets dad and stale and 

976
00:49:59,731 --> 00:50:00,550
tyrannical and everything goes 
immediately to help.

977
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,660
And that's not a good thing.
And then with regards to nature,

978
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:09,661
well you obviously have to appreciate 
the positive element of nature and you 

979
00:50:09,661 --> 00:50:10,330
have to enter into a relationship with 
it,

980
00:50:10,331 --> 00:50:15,331
but you don't bloody well want to forget
that like things are out to get you and 

981
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:20,701
you know you have to be intelligent and,
and ready and awake so that you can 

982
00:50:20,701 --> 00:50:24,340
prevail against them and you have to be 
grateful for what you've been offered by

983
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:29,341
other people and by the tremendous 
efforts of all of culture across all of 

984
00:50:29,341 --> 00:50:33,671
the time,
that's put you in a position where 

985
00:50:33,671 --> 00:50:35,741
you're so unbelievably privileged and 
have so many opportunities at your,

986
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,140
at your disposal.

987
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:45,200
Well.
So that's kind of the archetypal story 

988
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,820
of human beings.
We always face nature and it's always on

989
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:49,130
our side.
We always face our culture.

990
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:53,060
It's always on our site and we always 
have ourselves and those things that are

991
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:55,610
arrayed against us internally,
externally.

992
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:01,210
And that's the.
You could say that's the existential 

993
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,271
world.
It's the world of drama and the things 

994
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:05,390
that are really compelling to you as 
means of communicating.

995
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,600
Use those categories to provide you with
information because what you're trying 

996
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,600
to figure out is if that's the landscape
that makes up your being.

997
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,700
So that's a phenomenological idea.
How is it that you weave your way 

998
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,111
through it?
While that's what we're going to figure 

999
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:23,111
out?
Well,

1000
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:23,111
we go through this class.
Okay,

1001
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,350
so that's the mythological background.
So there's the character,

1002
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:29,030
illogical elements that I just 
described.

1003
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:32,390
And then there's the punctuated movement
forward.

1004
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:37,510
Now you know,
the problem with that is that when 

1005
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:39,701
things fall apart,
it's not like you just fall apart 

1006
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:41,360
psychologically.
It's not just a psychological condition.

1007
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,480
You know,
if someone's be trade you deeply,

1008
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,680
that might be because you're naive and 
unready and maybe that's a psychological

1009
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:50,500
element.
Maybe you're just young and you know you

1010
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:55,510
don't know battery and you couldn't,
but there's also the real fact of the 

1011
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:59,681
problem that you have in fact been 
betrayed and now you don't know what to 

1012
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:00,560
do.
So there's reality in it as well as just

1013
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:01,520
what psychological.

1014
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,930
And so

1015
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,120
one of the things that you might.
One of the ways that you might construe 

1016
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,310
personality theories that have to deal 
with a description of the way people are

1017
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:18,311
and a description of how they might move
towards mental health is that there are 

1018
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:22,661
maps that tell you how to their maps of 
that landscape that tell you how to 

1019
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:26,570
Orient Yourself so that you can succeed 
and even better,

1020
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:31,040
and this is a Piagetian idea.
It's not only so that you can succeed,

1021
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,940
it's so that you can succeed in a way 
that your family succeed so that they 

1022
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,620
can succeed in a way that society 
succeeds so that everything works better

1023
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:42,530
at the same time.
And that's really success,

1024
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:48,010
you know,
and that's like you're winning a game 

1025
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,080
that everyone wants to play well,
what a deal.

1026
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,650
You get to move forward and everyone 
else gets to enjoy it.

1027
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:54,020
Well,
that's a good definition of success.

1028
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,570
It's an architectural definition of 
success actually,

1029
00:52:56,571 --> 00:53:00,680
because if you succeed properly,
then your success benefits everyone else

1030
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:05,420
so hard to imagine that there could be 
anything particularly wrong with that.

1031
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,940
Alright,
so

1032
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:14,710
that's the mythological element.
Now I want to tell you a little bit 

1033
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,710
about the shamonic element.

1034
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,710
Now

1035
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,360
the reason I want to talk to you about 
shamanism is because shamanism is a 

1036
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,270
very,
very old phenomena and Sharmin isn't.

1037
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:28,271
Looks like a phenomenon that involves 
the dramatization of transformation 

1038
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:33,441
processes,
so so one transformation process might 

1039
00:53:33,441 --> 00:53:38,301
be the initiation of young men.
Now it's more typical for young men to 

1040
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:42,990
be initiated.
Then young women and no one really knows

1041
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:47,991
why that is,
except men seem to be able to go more 

1042
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,601
spectacularly wrong than women so well,
so if you look at what we'll talk about 

1043
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,850
that later,
but there's also competing theories that

1044
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:58,851
say you don't have to initiate women 
because nature does that all by itself 

1045
00:53:58,851 --> 00:54:02,460
and I think that that's not a 
particularly bad way of looking at it.

1046
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,410
So women are going to be confronted with
the brute force of nature,

1047
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,970
but men can either do that or not do it,
and so there's in some sense an element 

1048
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:13,970
of choice.

1049
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,710
And so the initiation rituals take away 
the element of choice.

1050
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:21,711
And so on a typical initiation ritual,
what happens is that young men usually 

1051
00:54:21,711 --> 00:54:24,810
at the onset of puberty or taken away 
from their familial dependents,

1052
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:28,200
which really means their mothers and 
then they're put into some situation and

1053
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:31,650
terrified three quarters to death.
Now more or less,

1054
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:34,860
they do that voluntarily.
So perhaps here's an example,

1055
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:36,630
maybe you're 13.
So remember,

1056
00:54:36,631 --> 00:54:39,450
think about your 30.
Think about that.

1057
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:44,960
Okay?
And so you're still afraid of the dark 

1058
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:44,960
when you're 13,
even though they'll tell people that you

1059
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:44,960
aren't,
but you are.

1060
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:50,110
And so like if you were dropped naked in
the middle of a forest when you're 13 

1061
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:53,421
and it's midnight,
you're going to be plenty frozen with 

1062
00:54:53,421 --> 00:54:56,421
terror and a good thing too,
because you know it's dangerous out 

1063
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:56,421
there.
Okay?

1064
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:57,750
So then you think,
well maybe it's just a park,

1065
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,920
but you're still out there and it's dark
and you're afraid.

1066
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,560
You might say,
well,

1067
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:06,561
what are you afraid of?
And one of the things you might come up 

1068
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:08,010
with as well,
you're afraid of what you're imagining.

1069
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,320
And then you might say,
well,

1070
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:15,380
does that mean that you're afraid of 
your imagination or are you afraid of 

1071
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,870
the things your imagination represents?
Well,

1072
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,030
you kind of have to think if there's no 
actual objective danger there,

1073
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:23,040
then what you're afraid of is your 
imagination.

1074
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,520
Now,
did you guys ever see the Blair witch 

1075
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,100
project?
How many of you have seen that?

1076
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,480
How many of you haven't now?
So it's a pretty lousy example.

1077
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:38,750
Anyways,
it's a horror movie now there's kind of 

1078
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,360
two kinds of horror movies.
There's the splatter type horror movie 

1079
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,870
and I think actually those expose you to
discuss and then there's the fear kind 

1080
00:55:45,751 --> 00:55:48,750
of horror movie and that doesn't need to
have any Gore at all.

1081
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,130
It just makes you afraid.

1082
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:55,130
And the Blair witch project is very good
example of that because all that 

1083
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:55,130
happens,
nothing happens,

1084
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:00,020
nothing happens,
but you think something terrible is 

1085
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,871
going to happen every second and the 
sense that something terrible is going 

1086
00:56:02,871 --> 00:56:03,270
to happen keeps climbing through the 
whole movie.

1087
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:08,510
And so what they do is put you in a 
state of radical uncertainty and never 

1088
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:09,420
let you off.
Okay,

1089
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:14,690
well so basically they're playing with 
your imagination and that can work very 

1090
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:16,400
effectively,
like it's often horror movies,

1091
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:21,410
often more effective if they don't show 
you what's making those horrible noises 

1092
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:22,080
off screen,
you know,

1093
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:27,081
because no matter what show you,
the probability that he can be as 

1094
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:30,151
personally horrible as what are their 
monsters you're dredging up out of your 

1095
00:56:30,151 --> 00:56:31,930
imagination is very low.
So,

1096
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,080
and you know,
it's reasonable to be afraid of the dark

1097
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:37,180
because throughout our biological 
history,

1098
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:42,181
lots of unfortunate people were devoured
by things in the dark or hurt very badly

1099
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:43,610
by them,
etc.

1100
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,580
Etc.
And wE're also daytime creatures,

1101
00:56:45,581 --> 00:56:48,250
right?
So we don't like the dark very much.

1102
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,940
So what do you do to someone if you're 
going to initiate them is maybe you take

1103
00:56:54,701 --> 00:56:58,000
them when they're 13 and you put them in
a really dark cave and caves.

1104
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,390
There Are so dark man,
like if you're in a cave,

1105
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,280
you just can't believe how dark it is.
It's,

1106
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,920
it's,
you can't see anything in a cave.

1107
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:11,610
So you don't know how big the space 
you're in is and you don't know how 

1108
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,881
small it is and you don't know whether 
or not it's going to collapse or when 

1109
00:57:14,881 --> 00:57:17,880
it's going to stay up and you don't know
how far you are underground,

1110
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,280
especially if the people who took you 
there didn't,

1111
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:25,480
you know,
walk you around in circles and didn't 

1112
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,241
let you know where you were going and 
then maybe they leave and maybe they 

1113
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:27,241
leave for three days.

1114
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,900
And so you're sitting down there 
thinking,

1115
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,820
well,
what are you thinking?

1116
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:32,950
Exactly?
Well,

1117
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,610
you're thinking the most horrible 
thoughts you could possibly imagine,

1118
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:38,710
right?
I'm never going to get out of here.

1119
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,980
They're never going to find me again.
some horrible snake thing that lives in 

1120
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,761
the darkness is going to come and eat it
slowly because fast would be merciful 

1121
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,050
and I'm.
And then I'm also going to go completely

1122
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:55,180
out of my mind so that even if something
doesn't eat me,

1123
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:57,730
I'm going to come over here and it will 
be worse than being dead anyways.

1124
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,430
And so partly what you're doing in that 
circumstances,

1125
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,860
you're facing that demons of your own 
imagination.

1126
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:09,930
And if you can stand that,
then you grow up and that's what an 

1127
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:13,321
initiation ceremony tests.
Now a lot of what you'll find if you 

1128
00:58:13,321 --> 00:58:17,521
look at clinical theories of psychology,
the same motif applies if you want to 

1129
00:58:18,551 --> 00:58:23,551
get better,
you have to find out what you're 

1130
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:25,621
avoiding and what you're afraid of and 
maybe what you're disgusted by evil and 

1131
00:58:25,621 --> 00:58:30,001
you have to expose yourself to that 
voluntarily and you have to let that 

1132
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:32,950
change you.
And so it's not a pleasant prospect.

1133
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:38,130
I mean,
it's not dancing through a field of 

1134
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:38,130
daisies,
right?

1135
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:41,350
With muzak play and it'S not follow your
bliss.

1136
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:46,860
You know,
it's not the natural unfolding of a 

1137
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:46,860
positive process.
It's not that at all.

1138
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:50,140
It's the voluntary confrontation with 
the things that make up life's horrors.

1139
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,370
But what's interesting about it is that 
there's,

1140
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,590
there's an idea there that lurks under 
the surface architecturally,

1141
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,010
and that is there's a lot more to you 
than meets the eye,

1142
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,910
but it won't be released unless it has 
to.

1143
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,700
And so you don't have to even figure out
what it is until you put yourself in 

1144
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:08,700
peril.
Now,

1145
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,110
part of that you might think like 
imagine that you're.

1146
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,270
You're an introvert.
You're socially awkward.

1147
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:18,271
You're highly neurotic,
so you feel a lot of anxiety and 

1148
00:59:18,271 --> 00:59:20,581
depression.
You don't like going to partieS and 

1149
00:59:20,581 --> 00:59:21,110
that's because the horrible tyrant lives
at parties and always glaring at you and

1150
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,410
judging you and telling you how useless 
and insufficient you are.

1151
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:29,740
And so you go there and you don't even 
look at people because you know that if 

1152
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:34,001
you did look at them,
you just see the face of the judgmental 

1153
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:34,001
tyrant,
which by the way,

1154
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:34,760
you wouldn't if you actually looked at 
them,

1155
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:39,761
but you won't because you avoid and so 
you're going to go there and you're 

1156
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:40,100
going to put yourself in this terrible 
situation.

1157
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:41,930
And if you're lucky and you're a bit of 
weight,

1158
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,960
then you're going to incorporate all 
sorts of information from the external 

1159
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,561
world that will help you develop your 
social skills and make you more 

1160
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:50,561
sophisticated.

1161
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,490
And even if that doesn't happen,
you're going to learn that.

1162
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:55,220
You can tolerate your own fear.
And you might say,

1163
00:59:55,221 --> 01:00:00,221
well,
what's better to not be afraid or to 

1164
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:03,380
know that you can handle being afraid 
and obviously to not be afraid,

1165
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,980
but give that up because that ain't 
happening so that the next best thing 

1166
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,020
and the realistic thing is to know that 
you're the master of your own fear.

1167
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:18,100
And so a lot of what we're going to talk
about in relationship to classical 

1168
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,450
theories of personality is exactly that.
It's not that the world isn't terrible,

1169
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,280
is that the world is terrible,
but you're a lot stronger than you think

1170
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,510
and the way you.
Okay?

1171
01:00:26,511 --> 01:00:31,511
And so part of that is the strength that
you gather is partly the information 

1172
01:00:31,511 --> 01:00:33,020
that you gather when you go somewhere 
that you're not good at.

1173
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:38,050
You know,
so you're establishing new skills like 

1174
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:38,050
you haven't university.

1175
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,410
But there's another part that's 
interesting that's related to the little

1176
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:41,060
video that I showed you at the 
beginning.

1177
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,670
Dna turns out to be a very complex 
structure.

1178
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:49,040
And so if I put you in situation a,
then dna codes,

1179
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:54,041
certain kinds of proteins that help make
up the way that your mind is in the way 

1180
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:54,950
it works.
But if I take you and put you in another

1181
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,770
situation,
completely different genes turn on,

1182
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:03,700
and so what that means is that you have 
a biological repository of potential use

1183
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:09,850
lying dormant at the highest resolution 
level of your molecular structure.

1184
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:15,760
And then if you push yourself and all 
sorts of different directions and you 

1185
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,910
find different things to pursue and test
yourself against,

1186
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:22,060
then you're going to turn on parts of 
yourself that aren't currently on and 

1187
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,720
god only knows what you'd be like if you
turned yourself completely on.

1188
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,420
Maybe I could use a better metaphor.

1189
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:52,580
I'll tell you a little bit more about 
the shavano routines because they're 

1190
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:52,580
more,
you know,

1191
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,710
if there is a initiation archetype which
are kind of just described to you,

1192
01:01:55,711 --> 01:01:58,330
which is you can do this to yourself.
I'll Tell you,

1193
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,420
oh yeah,
and this is a good way to live.

1194
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,530
It beats the alternative.
anyone?

1195
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:07,531
So which is like the definition of a 
good way to live so mad and you're 

1196
01:02:07,531 --> 01:02:08,430
trying to pursue something so you've got
a goal.

1197
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:13,460
That's a good thing.
You got to have a goal and you don't 

1198
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:13,460
want to hold onto that too tightly 
because he might be wrong.

1199
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,170
You've got to be willing to let that go 
and have a different goal,

1200
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:19,290
but you need to go and then you know 
while you're pursuing the goal,

1201
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:24,291
you're gonna.
Find out that there's some obstacles in 

1202
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:25,050
your path obviously,
and maybe some of those obstacles are of

1203
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:30,051
a frightening time,
or maybe they're even have a disgusting 

1204
01:02:30,051 --> 01:02:30,051
type.

1205
01:02:30,051 --> 01:02:32,750
You might say,
I don't want to turn into that kind of 

1206
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,851
person,
so those of you who are sort of 

1207
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,161
socialist utopia,
left wingers might think that way about 

1208
01:02:37,161 --> 01:02:37,161
business people.
It's like,

1209
01:02:37,161 --> 01:02:41,271
I would,
I would recommend that you get over it 

1210
01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:41,271
as rapidly as possible.
So anyways,

1211
01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:43,320
you might think there's no way I'm going
to act that way.

1212
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:48,321
So you sort of put it off limits saying,
or maybe you're afraid to do what you 

1213
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:50,340
need to do next.
Well,

1214
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:55,520
here's the rule.
Don't avoid doing things because they 

1215
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,381
make you feel negative emotion.
If you have to do those things in order 

1216
01:03:00,381 --> 01:03:00,540
to pursue your goals,
in fact,

1217
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:05,541
you should do exactly the opposite.
So let's say you're pursuing a goal and 

1218
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:06,630
you find that you're afraid about 
something and so you're avoiding it.

1219
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:10,140
The first thing you should think is a 
hot look.

1220
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,120
I'm afraid of something and I'm avoiding
it.

1221
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,860
Dragon treasure.
Exactly there.

1222
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:19,560
And that's exactly right.
It's precisely right.

1223
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,080
If you're.
If you're afraid of the thing,

1224
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:27,081
then what that means is that you're not 
developed enough to handle it and you 

1225
01:03:27,081 --> 01:03:30,231
need to be.
So you should think about that as a 

1226
01:03:30,231 --> 01:03:30,231
discovery,
like a positive discovery.

1227
01:03:30,231 --> 01:03:33,690
You found out where you have a weakness 
and you're now able to address it.

1228
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,450
So you know if you're an introvert and 
you think it's friday night,

1229
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:38,670
I could go to this party,
but you know I really don't want to.

1230
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,140
Then you think,
oh,

1231
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,400
that means I should go.
And that's exactly right because

1232
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:55,070
because you already know how to do the 
things that you know how to do and it's 

1233
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:57,540
the things that you don't know how to do
that bother you and oppress you.

1234
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,790
And of course those things are going to 
be difficult to learn about,

1235
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:04,791
but you need to learn about them because
you need to get yourself all switched 

1236
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:04,860
on.
How's that switched on?

1237
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:11,360
Because then you'll be able to tolerate 
the fact that life is fundamentally 

1238
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,130
suffering and so you don't know.
The world doesn't get safer us.

1239
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:16,020
You developed,
in fact quite the contrary.

1240
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:21,170
You just get more competent and that's 
better anyways because it's conceivable 

1241
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:23,670
that you don't want safety anyways.
You probably want adventure.

1242
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,840
You probably want to be compelled.
You probably want to be engaged.

1243
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,190
You know,
if you want security,

1244
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:34,191
you might as well be dead well because 
nothing's happening then and that 

1245
01:04:34,191 --> 01:04:37,950
there's no danger to be alive is to be 
contending with the world and you want 

1246
01:04:39,241 --> 01:04:44,241
to be the best you can possibly be.
And that's partly what we're going to 

1247
01:04:44,241 --> 01:04:46,200
learn about as we go through the entire 
course.

1248
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:51,201
But certainly the elements that have to 
do with clinical psychology because all 

1249
01:04:51,201 --> 01:04:52,860
of them circulate around this 
fundamental fee.

1250
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,920
They have to.
Because it's the fundamental story of 

1251
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,841
mankind and we want to know what that 
fundamental story is because we're all 

1252
01:04:59,841 --> 01:05:02,430
human and you need to know the story and
then you know,

1253
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:04,290
you can decide how you're going to act 
it out,

1254
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,050
but at least you need to know the damn 
story first.

1255
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:10,110
So we'll see you.
