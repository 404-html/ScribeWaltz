1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:06,170
Okay,
so there was a couple of things that I 

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,931
wanted to tell you that were left open 
in the last lecture.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,800
The first one was that I told you that 
there were two types of games and then I

4
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:18,801
only told you about one type of games,
so I know you've all been dying of 

5
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:22,221
curiosity about that ever since.
So the first type of game that we talked

6
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:26,610
about was the one where everyone has a 
particularly shared goal.

7
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:28,290
You might think of that as a structured 
game,

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,120
but the second type of game that Piaget 
was interested in was a dramatic or 

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,121
pretend play games.
And generally how a pretend play episode

10
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:43,731
works is that um,
while our child can all always do this 

11
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:44,970
by him or herself,
but if it's a group game,

12
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:49,971
usually what happens is the kids get 
together a little group and they 

13
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:51,960
basically script out a little plane and 
it's like,

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,270
it's like um,
what you call it,

15
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:56,970
spontaneous improvisation,
you know.

16
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,490
And so maybe they'll play house and then
they assign,

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,410
you know,
a,

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,690
a player to each role.
And I guess that would normally be 

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,271
mother and father and baby often and 
maybe pet dog or cat,

20
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:13,971
so you know you can be the cat and you 
can be the mom and you can be the day I 

21
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:17,720
didn't.
Then they'll set up a little dramatic 

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,920
arena and maybe it's you know,
like a cable covered with blankets which

23
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:24,921
kids seem to particularly like.
And then they'll run through the game 

24
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:29,300
now and in some sense what they're doing
is imitating their parents or maybe 

25
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:33,810
their pat or maybe the baby,
but it's not exactly imitation.

26
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:38,811
And,
and this is an important thing to note 

27
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:40,500
because imitation would imply if you're 
imitating someone,

28
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,410
what your incense doing is duplicating 
what they just did.

29
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,430
Now there are robots for example.
Now if you want to teach the robot how 

30
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,290
to do something.
So maybe the robots got an arm.

31
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,860
In fact it does.
You can grab it's arm and you can go 

32
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:54,860
like this.

33
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,470
And then as long as you put a cam there,
the robot will do exactly that precisely

34
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:05,450
that.
So your teaching,

35
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:09,710
if it has the capability of imitating 
movements that it's already done once.

36
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,220
But you know,
when you're a kid and you're playing 

37
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,860
house and maybe you're being the mother,
you don't precisely duplicate with your 

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,350
body exactly the movements that you saw 
your mother make,

39
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,600
maybe the last time you saw her or the 
last time you were watching her.

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,200
What did you seem to be able to do 
instead is to watch your mother over 

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,680
long periods of time and extract out 
something that you might describe as her

42
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:38,681
spirit.
And I know that that's not really a 

43
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:40,490
psychological or a scientific word,
but it's a useful word because.

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,250
Or You could perhaps say her 
personality,

45
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:48,251
but it's not her personality.
Exactly because it's her personality as 

46
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,640
mother,
which isn't really her personality.

47
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,970
It's the mother personality and that 
mother personality is something that has

48
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:59,981
been practiced by mothers for who knows 
how long and what the child seems to do 

49
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,590
when she will say for this example is 
watching her mother,

50
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:10,540
is extract out what the spirit of 
motherhood is and then embody that.

51
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,220
Right?
And so you might think of this spirit of

52
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:17,221
motherhood as those elements of behavior
and perception and emotion and cognition

53
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,200
for that matter.
But it's an,

54
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,260
it's an embodied,
all of those embodied simultaneously 

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,900
what's in common across all the 
instances of acting like a mother,

56
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,670
you know,
so you could say,

57
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:34,870
well that's mother like behavior and who
knows what that might be.

58
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:39,871
I mean,
what you want to do is conjure up the 

59
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:40,870
stereotype,
roughly speaking of a mother,

60
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,570
you know,
people don't really like stereotypes,

61
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:48,571
especially in psychology,
but almost all your thinking is in 

62
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:48,571
stereotypes.

63
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:51,840
So there's not much difference between 
the stereotype and a category or 

64
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,850
categories are oversimplifications and 
so our stereotypes.

65
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,460
But anyways,
so you take management the stereotype of

66
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:02,461
a mother and then the child is acting 
that out and what they're trying to do 

67
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,090
is to become the mother roughly 
speaking.

68
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,760
So,
and why?

69
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,140
Well,
for obvious reasons,

70
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:10,330
there's obvious reasons why someone 
would do that.

71
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:12,700
It's because without mothers,
there wouldn't be any human beings.

72
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:17,701
And so if we didn't have successful 
mothers then that would be the end of 

73
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:17,890
us.
And so we wouldn't be here to talk about

74
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:22,891
it so that now one of the things that 
piaget observed was this kind of 

75
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,840
dramatic play was extraordinarily 
important to children because it,

76
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,170
it helped them learn how to act like 
they would act maybe when they're older 

77
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,940
children or maybe when they're teenagers
or maybe when they're young adults.

78
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,180
It's a trial run in a relatively safe 
environment.

79
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,320
One of the things I'd be thinking about,
it's not that easy to precisely specify 

80
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,431
the role of a father,
but I really believe that one of the 

81
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:50,431
things that fathers do,
if they do a good job being fathers,

82
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:55,101
is that they circumscribe a safe space 
within the house or within the familial 

83
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:59,890
environment where the children can play 
free of interference.

84
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,370
And so then because play is also a very 
sensitive behavior,

85
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,680
but by which I mean that it's easy to 
disrupt play in children.

86
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,390
If there's anything wrong with the 
child,

87
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,420
they won't play.
So one of the ways that you can tell if 

88
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:18,420
your child is doing well is that they're
playing.

89
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,371
I mean,
I suppose you could say the same thing 

90
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:23,371
about your dog or maybe even your 
partner,

91
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:27,210
you know,
if they're in a playful mood than 

92
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,730
perhaps there isn't anything 
particularly wrong with the relationship

93
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:32,731
at the moment on all their,
all the needs that might be regarded as 

94
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:36,480
in some sense more fundamental have been
met and so to get children to play well 

95
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,891
you have to circumscribe a safe area and
they have to be taken care of and then 

96
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:43,780
they can experiment with different modes
of Ba and they do that by themselves,

97
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:48,781
but they also do that in the company of 
other children and obviously what 

98
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,020
they're doing is practicing for later 
roles and you know,

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,540
you see this sort of thing and children 
at multiple levels because not only will

100
00:05:55,541 --> 00:06:00,541
they play out being a parent,
that's a very common element of child's 

101
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:04,961
play,
but they'll also often develop sort of 

102
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:06,710
fixations on slightly older children,
maybe a year older or two,

103
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,050
two years older and sort of hero worship
that worship them and follow them around

104
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:13,430
and,
and imitate them even more directly than

105
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:14,560
they might imitate a parrot.

106
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,570
Now,
obviously the child has his or her 

107
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,660
reasons for that and the reasons are,
is they're trying to advance to the next

108
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:25,661
stage so they scan the environment,
look for someone who seems to have done 

109
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:26,720
that well,
whatever that means,

110
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,090
um,
who looks competent and has maybe 

111
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,150
friendly and who could tolerate having a
kid trailed along behind them and then 

112
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,141
they,
they act them out and so play all the 

113
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:43,091
forms of play that we described.
The two basic forms are extremely 

114
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:46,691
important to children and when you see 
them pretending it as a parent,

115
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:51,821
one of the things that you should 
realize is that it's an extraordinarily 

116
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:53,630
important form of activity.
It's how they socialize themselves.

117
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,170
Now,
the other thing that I didn't mention,

118
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,530
this is going,
this is concentrating on piaget as well.

119
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:05,531
As you know,
we talked a little bit in the 

120
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:07,901
mythological and shamanic initiation 
lectures about the idea that human 

121
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,400
personality evolution is a punctuated 
upward development.

122
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,380
So he moved ahead and then you encounter
something that gets in your way,

123
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:23,381
some sort of severe obstacle and it 
either blocks you behaviorally so that 

124
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:28,001
you can't get to your goal using your 
current behavioral plans or it's even 

125
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:32,150
more complex than that and it disrupts 
the whole structure that you're using to

126
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,900
integrate your behavior across time.
You know?

127
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:40,901
So the difference between that would 
roughly be the difference between say 

128
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:43,460
going home to your partner or going on a
date with your partner suit me.

129
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,470
People still do such things are going 
out with your partner and them being in 

130
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,441
an irritable mood.
And so what that would mean is that 

131
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:56,381
maybe you smile at them or you tell them
a joke and you know it falls flat or 

132
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:57,920
they responded in an angry manner and so
you're going to orient to that.

133
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,720
It's going to make things fall apart a 
little bit.

134
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,320
You might say,
oh,

135
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:05,321
the whole night's ruined.
You probably don't say the whole 

136
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:05,870
relationship has had it,
but if that happens enough times,

137
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:06,770
you might.
But you might say,

138
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:08,120
oh,
the whole night's ruined.

139
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,420
Or maybe you'll.
Which is probably a bit of an 

140
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,091
overreaction right off the bat.
Like my impression as a clinician is 

141
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:18,110
that when people are being difficult to 
get along with,

142
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:23,111
you should let them do it three times 
while you track it because then the 

143
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,560
third time they do it,
you can say,

144
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:25,880
look,
you've done this,

145
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,410
here's what you're doing.
And I said,

146
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:28,640
no,
I'm not doing that.

147
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,960
And you say hi.
Yes you are because I saw you do it then

148
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:36,320
and then and then,
and then they're basically screwed.

149
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,510
You win right away if you do that.
So,

150
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,060
but more,
more seriously.

151
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,010
If it's just one little episode,
it's best to let it go.

152
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,620
You don't really have any proof and 
maybe there's just some,

153
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,200
you know,
local thing wrong three times.

154
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:56,201
That's a whole different issue because 
then you've got some credibility and 

155
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,900
it's a nice balance between being too 
impulsively reactive,

156
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,950
you know,
because you should stand up for 

157
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:02,950
yourself.
Right?

158
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,270
Well,
does that mean that you should respond 

159
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:05,270
to every little slight while you're 
going to be reacting all the time if you

160
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,981
do that,
but you don't want to be a pushover and 

161
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:12,141
let people walk all over you so you have
to find some balance between being 

162
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:16,290
tolerant so you don't have unnecessary 
fights and being tough so that you don't

163
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,650
have unnecessary fights and three is a 
nice number anyways,

164
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,100
so you're with your partner and they're 
being annoying and you know you can 

165
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,010
reconstruct your behavior.
Maybe instead of telling jokes,

166
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:32,220
you look at your phone and let them calm
down or something like that.

167
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,280
You haven't disrupted much of the frame 
that you're using to interact with them 

168
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,050
right?
The night the evening is still 

169
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,070
continuing in its planned manner.
You can still use the perceptual 

170
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,490
structures and the expectations that 
were guiding you.

171
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,640
They're modified at a very high 
resolution minor level and then so 

172
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,950
that's going to upset you a little bit 
because you're going to think,

173
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,050
you know what's going on here.
Maybe you'll think,

174
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:56,680
is there something wrong with me or are 
you going to.

175
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,760
If you're self conscious will do that or
maybe you'll think that there's 

176
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:01,760
something wrong with them,
whatever,

177
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,900
but it's not that serious,
but then you know,

178
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,560
maybe you go on a,
you,

179
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,640
you're out with your partner and uh,
you know,

180
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,560
some person wanders over your 
restaurants,

181
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,440
a person wanders over to the table and 
says hello to your partner.

182
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,930
I didn't know that you had a girlfriend 
or boyfriend,

183
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,830
you know,
you didn't tell me that when we went out

184
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,650
last week.

185
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,740
Well,
that's going to be a whole different 

186
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:27,740
scenario,
right?

187
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:27,900
Yeah.
And you all laugh about that because you

188
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:30,150
know perfectly well that it's a 
different scenario.

189
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,050
Right?
And you might say,

190
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:36,051
well,
why is the one scenario more disrupting 

191
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:40,130
than the other?
An answer to that is something like if 

192
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,190
your presuppositions about the world are
arranged in a hierarchy in a sense,

193
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,110
so that the little actions that you take
to do something or at the very bottom of

194
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:54,111
the hierarchy,
they're the micro details and then you 

195
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,290
continue to abstract art all the way to 
the top,

196
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,550
which might be,
I'm in a committed relationship now.

197
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,430
There's levels of hierarchy going from 
being in a committed relationship to the

198
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:04,530
little options that you undertake with 
one another.

199
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,890
The higher up you you have to go in the 
hierarchy,

200
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,930
the higher up the disruption occurs in 
the hierarchical level,

201
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:14,490
the more upset you're going to beat.

202
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,630
So irritable partner,
well,

203
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:21,690
you can sort of walk around that 
unfaithful partner.

204
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,500
Well,
you know,

205
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:27,501
that's pretty much up at the top of the 
hierarchy where you have to start 

206
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:30,351
rethinking your past and your present 
and your future and maybe who you are 

207
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:31,500
and who they are and who men are and who
women are.

208
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:32,400
And it's like,
it's,

209
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,150
uh,
it's really,

210
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,290
it's a disaster,
right?

211
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,380
Everything falls apart.
Well then that's the little trip to the 

212
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,351
underworld that we talked about.
Now Piaget had an idea like that also 

213
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:45,450
with regards to children because his 
stage theory is a punctuated theory.

214
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:50,451
One of the things he noted about 
children with that was that they would 

215
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:52,830
construct a structure and a structure 
would be.

216
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,780
I think,
again,

217
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,060
the best way to think about it as,
as a personality,

218
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,260
because the personality has thoughts and
emotions and motivations and action.

219
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,270
So all of those at the same time,
it's this little alive sub element of 

220
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,311
view and the children's children are 
conjuring up these little sub elements 

221
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:15,691
of themselves that have functional 
utility as they build themselves from 

222
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:15,691
the,
from the,

223
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:18,010
from their motor systems upwards and 
now,

224
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:21,190
and then they run into a situation where

225
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,200
the

226
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,850
tools that they've built,
the subpersonalities that they built 

227
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,780
aren't fulfilling the desired function.
So maybe that'll happen when,

228
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:32,870
um,

229
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,710
you know,
a three year old goes to kindergarten 

230
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,351
and isn't making friends easily.
While that's going to be a child would 

231
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:45,080
come home after that cry,
fall apart,

232
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:46,940
and maybe be angry and tell their 
parents,

233
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,670
no one would play with me.
And you know,

234
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,780
they'll break down,
they'll have tears.

235
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,350
And it's almost as if they switch from a
domain where they're competent.

236
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:59,351
Like emotions signifies,
especially negative emotions signifies 

237
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:03,221
that you've moved from the domain in 
which you're competent to the domain in 

238
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:04,700
which you're not competent.
And if you're crying,

239
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,820
for example,
then that's often a distress signal,

240
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,880
sometimes it's anger,
but it's often a distress signal and it 

241
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,911
means I've,
I've ended up in a situation where what 

242
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:19,220
I know is no longer sufficient to 
produce the outcomes that I desire.

243
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,710
So you cry and then you get help people 
come and say,

244
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:23,010
well,
what's the matter?

245
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,040
And they give you a little pat and you 
know,

246
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,570
and they console you and then maybe they
help you strategize about what you could

247
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:34,571
do to make the situation better or how 
you could act or if you're a smart 

248
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:38,291
parent,
maybe you play with your child and 

249
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,580
offered them upgrade their ability to 
interact socially.

250
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:43,790
Or you can take them out on additional 
play dates or whatever and monitor their

251
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,090
behavior and help them reconstruct their

252
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,550
little subpersonalities.
So,

253
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,610
and bring in more information so that 
it's more sophisticated.

254
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:58,611
And so that would be the phd.
So this is a combination of the PSW and 

255
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:03,201
ideas of this stage theory,
which is movement upward with a 

256
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:06,591
punctuation.
That's the confusion because the 

257
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,740
previous structure is no longer well 
adapted to the world.

258
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,500
And then the idea of assimilation and 
accommodation,

259
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,930
psj kind of made assimilation and 
accommodation in a sense opposites and 

260
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,570
it's not exact,
it's hard to figure out,

261
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,960
but assimilation for piaget is when you 
pull information in and the structure,

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
the internal structure that you're 
pulling it into doesn't really have to 

263
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,061
change that much.
And accommodation is when you pull in a 

264
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:35,961
fairly mighty piece of information,
often negative and it's so disruptive 

265
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:40,101
that the structure that you're using to 
understand the information has to be 

266
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:43,671
reconstructed.
Now psj thinks of assimilation or 

267
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:47,841
accommodation,
but I think it's much easier to think 

268
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:50,481
about it on a continuum with the 
assimilation occurring at the level of 

269
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:51,310
micro behaviors.

270
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,310
You know,
like if you,

271
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,800
if you're trying to pick up a fork,
you know,

272
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:59,801
maybe your hands when you try to pick up
a fork and it doesn't work a couple of 

273
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:02,861
times,
then you just change your grip and pick 

274
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:02,861
it up.
Like it's a little annoying.

275
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:06,020
You're going to look at the fork and 
you're going to try a couple of routines

276
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,820
to pick it up.
But you know,

277
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:09,980
it's not going to bring your whole damn 
world to a halt,

278
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,520
you know,
so whereas if you find a dead mouse in 

279
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,681
your soup,
well that's going to be a whole 

280
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:17,681
different story.
And again,

281
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:20,261
it's a hierarchical issue.
And so at the bottom near the motor 

282
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:21,860
structures,
I would say it's easy to assimilate.

283
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,980
You just have to make minor changes to 
the.

284
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,760
I like to think about them as maps 
really,

285
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,460
but their maps or personalities that no,
those don't sound the same,

286
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:32,450
but they're very similar.

287
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,150
Depends on whether the thing needs a 
little adjustment or whether you have to

288
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,550
toss the whole thing away and build a 
new one.

289
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:45,551
You know,
it's the difference between tightening 

290
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:45,551
the lug nuts on your car,
buying a new car.

291
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,830
You can see levels of.
You can understand it as levels of 

292
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,670
difficulty.
Another way of thinking about it,

293
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,080
you need to know this because you need 
to understand how it is that you figure 

294
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,930
out how upset you should get when 
something goes wrong.

295
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,600
It's a very,
very complicated question.

296
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:05,240
If you wake up with is an ache in your 
side,

297
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,240
how upset should you be?
Well,

298
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,800
you don't know.
It's like maybe it's nothing.

299
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,780
Maybe you're going to die of cancer in 
six months.

300
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:16,781
You don't know,
and so it's not self evident how people 

301
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:20,711
calibrate their emotions when something 
goes wrong because of the extent of the 

302
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,510
thing that went wrong is not clearly 
evident.

303
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,500
Your partner's crabby when you out for 
dinner,

304
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,110
does that mean that you're going to 
break up in two weeks?

305
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:32,230
While it might mean that,
so why don't you just flip out right 

306
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,230
away because the whole world's coming to
an end.

307
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,710
Well,
some people do,

308
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,190
right?
And those would be people who were 

309
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,391
higher in negative emotion.
They're hire and neuroticism because 

310
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:42,200
they're more likely to react as if a 
small,

311
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,380
potentially small anomaly or uncertainty
or threat or discontinuity or unexpected

312
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,620
occurrence is catastrophic.
We're an emotionally stable person.

313
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,250
You know,
you might really have,

314
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,370
you might have to say,
I'm breaking up with you before.

315
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:57,590
They're going to know,
look upset,

316
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:59,930
and maybe even then it's not going to 
bother them that much.

317
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,190
So.
So.

318
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,850
So you think of the motor hierarchy,
you know,

319
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,730
ranging from micro behaviors at the 
bottom to abstractions at the top,

320
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:12,731
and then you can understand how you 
might compute how upset you get when 

321
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:12,731
something goes wrong.

322
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,580
Assume that it's small to begin with.
Check at that level.

323
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:19,250
If you can't fix it at that level,
advanced one level up.

324
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,230
If your car doesn't work,
you don't buy a new one.

325
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,790
The first thing you do is maybe see if 
the battery is dead right?

326
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:30,791
Because that that's the path that you 
could take that would cause you the 

327
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,421
least amount of trouble and to really 
good schema for mental hygiene.

328
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,190
It's like Ockham's,
razor,

329
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:37,880
you know,
Ockham's,

330
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,020
razor and science,
right?

331
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:44,021
Does that make.
Does everybody know what Ockham's razor 

332
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,021
is?
How many people know how,

333
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,480
what Ockham's razor is?
Okay.

334
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,700
How many people don't know?
Oh,

335
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,420
that's amazing.
It's amazing.

336
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,980
That's okay.
Well,

337
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:52,020
you should know.
It's really too bad that you don't know.

338
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,290
It's undoubtedly no reflection on you.
Anyways.

339
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,430
Arcoms razor is the,
is the phrase referring to a what?

340
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,720
A principal that was established by an 
ancient thinker,

341
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Arcam and he said,
do not multiply your explanatory 

342
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,690
principles beyond necessity.
Okay,

343
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:20,691
and so what he meant was if you have six
reasons why something might have gone 

344
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:23,190
wrong and you can rank,
order them in terms of complexity,

345
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:28,530
pick the simplest one and then until you
disproved that,

346
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:31,200
stick with it and then go to the next 
simplest one and so on,

347
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:36,201
so and it's often used as a guiding 
principle in science where the where the

348
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:37,890
idea is

349
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,480
if you have a simple explanation,
don't complicate it up with a bunch of 

350
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,631
unnecessary assumptions and you also 
might be reflective of a deeper 

351
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:50,740
underlying truth,
which is that

352
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,730
it's unlikely for any set of entities to
be in any particular configuration,

353
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,100
but it's particularly unlikely for them 
to be an a not unlikely and complex 

354
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,910
configuration.
So anyways,

355
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:10,990
and so hopefully that's understandable.
You can tangle all those ideas together 

356
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,160
at the bottom of your personality 
hierarchy.

357
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:16,590
There are actions at the top.
There are abstractions.

358
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:18,780
Moral abstractions like be a good 
person.

359
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,020
When you run into something that's 
unexpected,

360
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,320
the amount you get upset is 
proportionate to the level in the 

361
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:27,750
hierarchy where the damage appears to be
taking place.

362
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:30,970
Now you kind of have to guess it,
that partner,

363
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,750
you do that with your temperament,
so if you're high in neuroticism,

364
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:36,060
you guessed catastrophe and if it's low 
in neuroticism,

365
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:41,061
you guess irrelevant and you do that 
partly because of the way that you 

366
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:42,390
perceive your own competence.
You know,

367
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:46,830
because if you've encountered minor to 
major problems in the past,

368
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,280
say even if you're a nervous person and 
you've solved them,

369
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,600
you might've learned while,
yeah,

370
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:56,601
it's a problem,
but I can fix problems so it's not 

371
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:56,601
really a problem.

372
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:56,670
Which is a really good way to think of 
yourself.

373
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,350
You know,
that's a better way,

374
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,340
a much better way to think of yourself 
that I'm a person with no problems.

375
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,690
It's like,
good luck with that,

376
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,870
but I'm a person who could successfully 
address problems if I concentrated on 

377
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,870
that.
That's very,

378
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,260
very useful.
And then the other way that your nervous

379
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:18,261
system sort of decides how upset you 
should get when something happens is by 

380
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:22,101
looking at how other people treat you.
And if they treat you like you're 

381
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:25,581
competent,
then your nervous system gets less 

382
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:25,581
neurotic.
That that's a good way of thinking about

383
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,890
you produce more Serotonin,
you react less globally to indications 

384
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:32,880
of error.
Okay.

385
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,890
So anyway,
so piaget,

386
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,130
he talks about assimilation.
Assimilation is when you have to make a 

387
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,891
little change in accommodation is when 
the whole damn structure has to be 

388
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:42,900
reconfigured.

389
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,200
And he thought about those in some sense
as separate types of learning,

390
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,700
but they're not.
They're on a,

391
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,570
they're on a continuum from very simple 
to very complex.

392
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,900
Have any of you ever heard of the idea 
of a paradigm shift?

393
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,230
How many people have heard of that?
Okay.

394
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:01,870
How many people haven't.
Alright,

395
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,230
do you know the name Thomas Kuhn?
Anybody?

396
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,270
No.
Okay.

397
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:12,271
Well Thomas Kuhn was a philosopher of 
science and he wrote a book in 1962 

398
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:12,320
called,
um,

399
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,770
scientific.
Is that what it's called?

400
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,530
The nature of scientific revolutions?
Yeah.

401
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,680
And coon basically said the same thing 
about the way knowledge structures 

402
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,180
proceeded,
as Piaget said,

403
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:28,570
about that progression of knowledge 
structures within the individual.

404
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:33,571
So going with concerned about large 
scale transformations in scientific 

405
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,280
viewpoint.
So let me give you an example.

406
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,880
So in the late eighties and nineties,
physicists were convinced that they're 

407
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,080
just going to have to shut the whole 
endeavor down.

408
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,000
Why?
Well,

409
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:51,001
because the physicists knew everything 
there was to know there wasn't a single 

410
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:54,541
phenomena at that point that physicists 
could not account for it except one.

411
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,020
And here's the one that they couldn't 
account for it.

412
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,340
So imagine you're on a train and it's 
going that way at half the speed of 

413
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:10,591
light and you shine a flashlight,
you're standing on the top of the trade,

414
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,890
obviously protecting yourself against 
the wind.

415
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,940
And you shine a light going ahead and 
you measure the speed of light out of 

416
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,410
your flashlight.
The speed of light is 186,000

417
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:26,290
miles per second out of your flashlight.
Okay?

418
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,900
So now you're on,
you're on the ground and you're watching

419
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:33,901
this train zip by and the guys on top of
it shining a flashlight and light comes 

420
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:36,880
out of the front of his flashlight and 
you measured the speed of it.

421
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,410
What's the speed?

422
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:45,810
While you might think,
well obviously it's the speed of light 

423
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,211
plus half the speed of light because the
train is going half the speed of light 

424
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:48,211
and the light is going the speed of 
light,

425
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:52,981
and so the light coming from the 
combination of the train and the light 

426
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:54,940
is this is the speed of light plus half 
the speed of light.

427
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
That's what would happen if someone was 
throwing the ball right,

428
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,620
but that isn't right.
What happens is it's the speed of light 

429
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,120
and no matter how fast you're going,
when you shine your flashlight out,

430
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,920
the light coming out of your flashlight,
he's going to be going exactly 186,000

431
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,870
miles an hour,
minute second,

432
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,980
sorry,
hundred 80,

433
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:13,150
6,000
miles a second.

434
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,600
It's not additive and so if you're.
If you're on the train and you're 

435
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,230
backwards and you're shining your light 
and the person meshes,

436
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:23,260
it's not the speed of light minus half 
the speed of light,

437
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,420
which is what it would be if you were 
throwing the ball.

438
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,870
It's speed of light.
Well,

439
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:31,060
nobody knew how the hell to account for 
that.

440
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:33,250
It's like that just made no sense at 
all,

441
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:35,140
but everyone was ignoring it.
Well,

442
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:40,141
it turns out you can ignore that and 
that wasn't the only thing that wasn't 

443
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:45,241
quite well laid out at the end of the 
19th century from the perspective of 

444
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:45,740
physics,
but it was a big one,

445
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,980
and to solve that Newtonian physics had 
to be completely overthrown and quantum 

446
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,220
physics put in its place and quantum 
physics is quantum physics.

447
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,520
You might think of it as a box like this
and inside that there's a box that says 

448
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,301
Newtonian physics and quantum physics 
can explain everything that Newtonian 

449
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:07,580
physics can explain,
but it explains some more things besides

450
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,830
and so you would say because of that,
it's a better theory.

451
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,210
Now I might say,
well,

452
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,270
you just made a personality 
transformation.

453
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,240
Are you better person than you were 
before?

454
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,900
And you might say,
well,

455
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,670
how in the world can you make a judgment
like that?

456
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:20,450
And I would say,
well,

457
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:23,900
if you're a better personality,
you could do all the things you could do

458
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:26,630
before just as well or maybe even a 
little better.

459
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,770
Plus there's a bunch of new things that 
you can do that's a better personality.

460
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,400
So another interesting example of how 
the idea of better,

461
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,440
which really is a moral idea in some 
sense,

462
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,230
better versus worse,
you can conceptualize it,

463
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,030
but this is one of the things that 
piaget is really,

464
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:46,031
really useful because it gives you a,
a language that's grounded in 

465
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:49,670
observation and in science to start to 
handle questions that start to border on

466
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:52,160
the moral.
So a better personality can do more than

467
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,460
the previous personality could and you 
can certainly see how that would be 

468
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:57,460
applicable to your life.

469
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,460
And one of the things I would suggest as
a consequence of that is,

470
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,880
you know,
people always compare themselves to 

471
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,250
other people and generally what you do 
is you compare yourself.

472
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:12,251
You make a little dominance hierarchy 
out of the people that are right around 

473
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:14,060
you and this is a very annoying 
propensity because what it means is that

474
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:16,160
no matter how successful you get in your
life,

475
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,500
you're still going to be in the middle 
of the dominance hierarchy.

476
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,140
So you'll end up,
I dunno,

477
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,460
maybe you end up,
God,

478
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:25,040
I don't know.
Maybe you're CEO of a $100,000,000

479
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,150
company.
Let's say,

480
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,600
well,
I'll get to go hang out with a bunch of 

481
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,720
ceos and like there's 10 of them.
Three of them are ceos of a $2,000,000

482
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:37,721
company.
It's like you're a pretty little CEO 

483
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:39,740
among those people,
but who are you going to be comparing 

484
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:39,740
yourself to?
The guys who pick up your trash?

485
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,700
It's like,
no,

486
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,960
you could,
but you won't.

487
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,230
You'll have your little group around you
and you'll be somewhere in the middle,

488
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:50,231
and so that's useful to know because 
that means that what you have to learn 

489
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:55,211
to cope with is the fact that you're 
going to be somewhere in the middle and 

490
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:55,211
then you might say,
well,

491
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:59,381
how do you cope with that?
Because you should be improving and you 

492
00:25:59,381 --> 00:25:59,381
also want to be very good at something.
Well,

493
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:04,300
I think the best way to do that,
and this is especially true when you're 

494
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,931
older,
is that you don't compare yourself to 

495
00:26:07,931 --> 00:26:09,581
other people.
You compare yourself to the previous 

496
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:09,800
version of you.
It's a good control,

497
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,420
right?
Because you'll see,

498
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:14,660
especially by the time you were about 30
when you're young,

499
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:19,661
you have to compare yourself to other 
people because because when you're 

500
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,650
young,
you're a lot like all other young people

501
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:26,651
in some sense,
but by the time you're 30 year old or 

502
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:26,651
you're not very much like other people 
at all,

503
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,790
and so you know because the conditions 
of your life start to become so unique 

504
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,421
and specific to you.
Well then comparing yourself to other 

505
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:37,811
people isn't very helpful,
but comparing yourself to who you were 

506
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:40,481
before,
that's really helpful and you can keep 

507
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:40,481
doing that your whole life and it's a 
fair game.

508
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:45,191
Right?
Because the previous you had all the 

509
00:26:45,191 --> 00:26:45,191
problems and all the

510
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,060
like opportunities and and positive 
attributes that you have.

511
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,330
It's fair.
It's a fair game and it'll.

512
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,770
It'll save you an awful lot of misery,
so alright,

513
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,370
so

514
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,900
the outline,
different forms of games and he talked 

515
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,691
about different ways that those aided in
socialization and you can understand 

516
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:16,931
that I used this Meta idea which was the
hierarchy of personality to sort of 

517
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:20,300
explain that from a Piagetian 
perspective.

518
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:25,301
You put yourself together from your body
upward towards increased abstractions 

519
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:28,310
and as you do that you can do more 
things with your body,

520
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,460
but you can also do more complex things.
Integrating those things that you do 

521
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,350
with your body across time and with 
increasing numbers of other people.

522
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Now he actually has this really cool 
idea about what constitutes morality as 

523
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,480
a consequence of that.
So he would say,

524
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,920
all right,
so let's say

525
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,880
you can choose gay or you can choose 
game be and you might say,

526
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:54,881
well I want to figure out whether they 
may or gave me is a better game because 

527
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:55,910
if I'm going to play a game,
it might as well be a better game.

528
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,470
And so he would say,
okay,

529
00:27:57,471 --> 00:28:01,340
so here's how you can figure out if the 
game you're playing is a good one.

530
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,870
Okay.
It's good for you now,

531
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,540
it's good for you now,
next week,

532
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,130
next month,
next year,

533
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:13,580
and 10 years from now.
So don't always a good for you now,

534
00:28:13,581 --> 00:28:16,520
but if you play it repeatedly,
things get better for you.

535
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,840
Okay?
So that's,

536
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,180
that's a game where you're taking the 
future into account.

537
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,340
It's not an impulsive game,
you know,

538
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:27,200
like if you wanna if cocaine is really,
really good for people for about a day,

539
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,230
but over a week or six months or five 
years,

540
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,550
it's a degenerating game.

541
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,880
So,
and you can't use your emotion to 

542
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,401
determine that because cocaine generally
suffuses the person who's using it with 

543
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:43,961
a sense of power and possibility.
So you can't just rely on your emotion 

544
00:28:43,961 --> 00:28:48,050
no more than you can when you're tempted
to do something impulsive and fun,

545
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:49,880
but that might have negative 
consequences.

546
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:54,881
Okay?
So the game should be good now and 

547
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:57,491
across the future and then it should be 
good for you and it should be good for 

548
00:28:57,491 --> 00:29:02,171
your family and it should be good for 
your social community and so forth as 

549
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:06,251
you spiral out word.
And it should be good for all of those 

550
00:29:06,251 --> 00:29:08,621
things across multiple expanses of time 
and PSJ would call that an e rated game.

551
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:15,790
Now there's another additional idea 
behind the idea of inequality rated 

552
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:20,381
game,
which is that if I'm playing a game 

553
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:24,251
that's good for me and it's good for you
and it's good for you and it's good for 

554
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:27,251
you,
then we probably will all be willing to 

555
00:29:27,251 --> 00:29:30,011
play it voluntarily.
And so that's also why piaget believed 

556
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:32,450
that in some sense a game like 
structure,

557
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,480
let's say a social structure that 
everybody plays because they want to is 

558
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,531
much better than a game like structure 
where everyone plays because they have 

559
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:41,531
to.
And so he would say,

560
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:45,791
well that's in part the technical 
difference between a tyranny and a 

561
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,710
democracy.
It's a bloody smart thinking.

562
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,220
No,
I think Piaget got further with that 

563
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,141
idea than anyone else had ever in 
history because you can understand 

564
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:55,930
there's this old idea.

565
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,850
Bob was hume,
another philosopher.

566
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,980
What's his first name?
What's that?

567
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,880
David?
Yes,

568
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:08,050
he took.
I can remember that.

569
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,230
David Hume.
He has this idea that you can derive 

570
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:13,570
from.
It is.

571
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,870
So it's another one of those principles 
like Arkansas Razor,

572
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,850
and what it means is something like 
this,

573
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,890
no matter how much you know about 
something,

574
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:24,100
that doesn't mean that you can figure 
out what you should do about it.

575
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:29,260
So here's an example.
Let's say we know AIDS is a problem.

576
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,470
We know cancer is a problem.
We know heart disease is a problem,

577
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,310
we know poverty's a problem,
etc.

578
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,520
There's all these problems.
How do you deTermine how you would 

579
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,490
allocate resources to those different 
problems?

580
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,930
Well,
it's a very,

581
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:46,780
very difficult problem to get out from a
scientific perspective.

582
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,940
And the reason for that is that,
well,

583
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:51,100
there's all these variables that you 
would have to equate.

584
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,920
Imagine you built a spreadsheet and so 
you were thinking,

585
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,740
okay,
which is the most trouble,

586
00:30:55,741 --> 00:30:57,520
some of these things,
and then you know,

587
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,710
which could we solve with the least 
amount of money?

588
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,130
While the problem is,
is that to to determine whether 

589
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,570
something is troublesome,
you still have to make a value judgment.

590
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:12,571
Like tHere's no way you can get to the 
bottom of the problem without 

591
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:12,970
introducing the problem of value 
judgment.

592
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,630
And that's partly why it's very 
difficult to derive an ot.

593
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,570
What you should do from an is what you 
know,

594
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,020
and that's why there's a distinction 
between science and morality are science

595
00:31:23,021 --> 00:31:28,021
and religion.
That's another way of thinking about it 

596
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:28,021
is that they're there.
They're different domains.

597
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,200
Now,
piaget in some sense has described a way

598
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:35,050
out of that because he does say,
well,

599
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:37,090
look,
a theory that's better than the previous

600
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:42,091
theory is the theory that explains the 
same amount plus more and you can apply 

601
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:45,751
that to your personality and then a game
that's better than a different game is 

602
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:48,220
one that benefits you and more people.

603
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,530
But it also does that over different 
spans of time.

604
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,290
Now,
game like that's very hard to compute.

605
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:58,291
You know,
when people talk about environmental 

606
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,211
sustainability,
what they're really talking about is a 

607
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:03,331
pig,
eddie and equivalent of calibrated game 

608
00:32:03,331 --> 00:32:05,850
where you can live in your family and 
your family can live in society and 

609
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,961
society can operate within an economy 
and the economy can exist within the 

610
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:14,070
oncology without having it is the 
economy tilt the ecology so that you 

611
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,210
can't live and your family can't live in
your society,

612
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:20,080
can function on the act and the economic
system can't function.

613
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,560
So there is this idea of multilevel 
ballots,

614
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,080
but those things are very,
very difficult to compute.

615
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,520
You know,
so,

616
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,620
but it's still a nice principle,
you know,

617
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:30,730
so if you're thinking,
well,

618
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:36,420
if you need a justification for what 
you're doing and you want to put 

619
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,451
yourself on from moral ground,
which is really useful because then 

620
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:42,721
people can't push you around verbally or
intellectually or any other way because 

621
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:42,721
you're,
you know,

622
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:44,990
you're grounded,
you're standing on something solid.

623
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,990
It's like you need to know why is this 
good for you as if you were someone you 

624
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,561
were taken care of.
Why is it good for you across a long 

625
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:53,690
period of time?
HoW does it benefit your family,

626
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,330
how does it benefit society,
and then you know,

627
00:32:56,331 --> 00:33:01,331
you can keep stepping upward from there.
So I could give you one example of 

628
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:03,530
someone who's doing that.
I think you know about that.

629
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:07,070
That's kin who figured out how to get 
plastic out of the oceans.

630
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,160
He's not just whining about it and you'd
like parading around with a sign that 

631
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,160
says,
you know,

632
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,111
I don't like pollution.
It's like as if you need to tell people 

633
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:17,111
that,
you know,

634
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:21,320
because everyone really doesn't like,
I don't like pollution and I'm against 

635
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,320
poverty.
It's like,

636
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,361
yeah,
well find someone who's for pollution 

637
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:25,610
and poverty.
Anyways,

638
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,780
this kid was about 17,
something like that,

639
00:33:28,781 --> 00:33:29,900
and he was diving around.

640
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,080
He's a diver,
I think it was spear fishing and he 

641
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,411
noticed there was more plastic than fish
and this wasn't a very happy discovery 

642
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:42,671
for him.
And then so I started thinking about 

643
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:45,581
that.
How can we get the plastic out of the 

644
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:47,081
oceans?
And then he was looking at manta rays 

645
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:49,601
and manta rays have these big wings that
help them sort of glide through the 

646
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:49,610
ocean.
And he thought about that for awhile and

647
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:54,611
then he thought,
well maybe I could build this sort of 

648
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:55,490
ray thing that lies on the surface of 
the ocean in a triangle,

649
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,730
and then it could be towed through the 
ocean and all the plastic would go to 

650
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,770
the apex of the triangle and then you 
can just scoop it up.

651
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,400
But then he did his calculations and I 
haven't got this story quite right,

652
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:10,400
but this is basically,
this is basically the story.

653
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:16,690
He did some calculations and found out,
well that's not cost effective because 

654
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,081
it takes a lot of energy to drag this 
thing through the water and there's a 

655
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:21,650
lot of water and you know,
and plus you're polluting like mad while

656
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:23,000
you're dragging this thing through the 
water.

657
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,980
And so probably it's just not that 
helpful.

658
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,050
But then he realized that if you go out 
in the ocean,

659
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,890
there are these massive things called 
gyres which are like,

660
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,670
they're like huge water hurricanes,
except they're very,

661
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:35,900
very,
very slow moving.

662
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,090
But they're huge.
They're continent size.

663
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,700
And so the oceans are already moving,
always moving.

664
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:43,460
So he thought hot,
since the ocean is moving,

665
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,400
there's no real reason to have to drag 
the,

666
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,710
the,
you know,

667
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,420
the plastic or the plastic gatherer 
through the water.

668
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:54,450
You could just nail it to the ocean bed 
with cables and then just have it sit 

669
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:57,140
there and then the ocean would go 
through it all by itself.

670
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,530
So he built A prototype which wasn't 
very big and he gathered up a fair bit 

671
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,010
of plastic,
all the plastics and the boat,

672
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:08,020
the foot of the ocean by the way.
And it really increases in density as 

673
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,281
you move up towards the top bitch.
So then he built a bigger one and then 

674
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:16,180
he got a bunch of.
He went on kickstarter and then he 

675
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,880
raised a bunch of money and then he got 
a bunch of engineers to look at his idea

676
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:17,450
and they said,
well,

677
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:19,070
you know,
this probably work.

678
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,130
So then they built a big one a couple of
kilometers long,

679
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:25,220
which is now in place off the shore of 
Japan.

680
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:30,370
They also sent a whole flotilla of 
people from California to who I do a 

681
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,690
garbage estimate,
see how much garbage,

682
00:35:32,691 --> 00:35:34,580
the risk of the water,
because there's a big spot in the middle

683
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:37,070
of the pacific called the great garbage 
spot,

684
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,470
which is full of great plastic spot.

685
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,270
It doesn't matter.
It's full of plastic.

686
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,560
So they went to estimate how much there 
was it in anyways.

687
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,580
He thinks he can guide this thing to the
bottom of the ocean and these big jars 

688
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,280
make it,
you know,

689
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,940
100 kilometers long in a v shape,
put a kind of a collector at the end of 

690
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:02,121
it,
load all the plastic he collects up on 

691
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:04,611
barges,
go refine that into oil or plastic and 

692
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:06,600
pay for it while he's doing it.
And so you can look them up.

693
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,270
Um,
and I think he's like 19 or 20 now.

694
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,350
So,
you know,

695
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,450
that's a good equilibrated game,
right?

696
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,850
That works out really well.
He gets to make some money.

697
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,760
Good for him.
He gets to employ a bunch of people.

698
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,180
That's a good thing.
Everybody's happy about it because it's 

699
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,180
good.
You know,

700
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,900
we're getting rid of the garbage and 
like there's no downside,

701
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:30,020
so it's hard to say.
It's hard to come up with an argument 

702
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,490
for why that isn't a good thing and it's
good.

703
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,760
It's good because everyone benefits all 
the way up.

704
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,240
So that's an equilibrated integrated 
state.

705
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,500
It's a very,
very,

706
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:41,610
very smart idea.

707
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Okay.
Now,

708
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,700
young

709
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,900
experimental psychologists don't like 
you.

710
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:59,990
Well,
they don't like freud either and they 

711
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,240
don't have much time for clinicians in 
general,

712
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,590
but that's okay.
They're not trying to solve the same 

713
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,161
problems.
Now usually if you take a personality 

714
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:15,321
course,
you'll cover freud before you cover 

715
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:18,261
young and the reason for that is that 
freud in some ways preceded young 

716
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:23,990
historically and lots of people,
especially the freudians like to think 

717
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:27,810
of young as freud's student and there's 
some truth to that because freud was the

718
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:32,811
first person who really collected up 
ideas about the unconscious and 

719
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,520
formalize them,
publicize them,

720
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:39,720
and applied them to the problems of 
pathology and mental health.

721
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,770
So good for him.
And freud was unparalleled at describing

722
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:49,020
pathological families and there's plenty
of those,

723
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,340
but young was interested in something 
that was underneath that.

724
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:57,050
I mean freud got underneath things a 
lot,

725
00:37:57,051 --> 00:38:02,051
you know,
he was also one of the first people to 

726
00:38:02,051 --> 00:38:04,001
point out just exactly how potent sexual
and aggressive motives were in shaping 

727
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:05,960
the way that we thought,

728
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,530
but young

729
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,540
[inaudible] was more interested in some 
sense,

730
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,790
young was more like a darwinian 
biologist.

731
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:22,090
He was much more interested in the 
biological and psychological,

732
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:28,810
philosophical history of fundamental 
human behavioral patterns and so young 

733
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:35,030
wasn't like a behaviorist can.
Behaviorist would think when you're 

734
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:39,431
born,
there's nothing there except the 

735
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:41,020
possibility to learn things.
You're a blank slate and then everything

736
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:46,021
you learned as a consequence of sensory 
information that you're picking up and 

737
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,820
what you learn as a consequence of that.
But young,

738
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,740
he didn't think that at all.
He thought that there's a specific human

739
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:58,741
nature and he set out to understand what
that human nature is.

740
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,020
Now,
a couple of lectures ago,

741
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:07,021
I talked to you about the characters 
that you might imagine making up the 

742
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:09,790
world that you inhabit.
So I said,

743
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:14,791
well,
you can think about the absolute 

744
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:14,791
unknown,
which is the unknown,

745
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:16,360
that so unknown that you don't even know
it's there.

746
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,200
That's something that is really,
really shocking if you ever encounter 

747
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,441
it,
and it's the sort of thing that you're 

748
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:27,151
exposed to.
hypothetically whenever you go to a 

749
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:27,550
horror movie that depends on fear,
right?

750
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:29,950
Because horror movies that depending on 
fear,

751
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,120
confront you with things that do not 
behave the way they're supposed to 

752
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,700
behave.
Like inanimate objects that move.

753
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
you know,
if all of a sudden you discover an 

754
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,621
inanimate object that moves,
there's a lot that's wrong with your 

755
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:45,940
particular model of the world and you 
can kind of experienced that in a horror

756
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:48,130
movie because things will do things 
they're not supposed to do,

757
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:51,160
like walls will bleed.
That's just not supposed to happen.

758
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,590
And so it's very upsetting to see 
something like that.

759
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,710
But you're exposing yourself to that in 
horror movies and trying to.

760
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,750
well,
you're trying to develop some courage 

761
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,510
because god only knows which of your 
fundamental major assumptions.

762
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,460
Mit might just turn it off

763
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,150
to be wrong.

764
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,820
So we talked about representations of 
the absolute unknown and I suggested 

765
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,680
that those are often associated with 
serpentine predators.

766
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:24,370
And then we talked about representations
of culture because like every character 

767
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,990
has to contend with culture,
whether it's a fictional character or 

768
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:28,990
you,
you're stuck with it,

769
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,840
you've got your culture and some of 
that's positive because here you are,

770
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:34,220
you can talk,
you can read,

771
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,750
it's warm,
you know,

772
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:38,380
you've got a bright future ahead of you.
And then it's also,

773
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:43,381
uh,
it's also a destructive tyrant because 

774
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:44,030
it's ruining the world and all those 
things that you already knew about.

775
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,560
And then.
So that's culture.

776
00:40:45,561 --> 00:40:48,050
And then there's nature because you're 
stuck with that too.

777
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:53,051
And there's a benevolent element of 
nature that's usually portrayed with 

778
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:57,581
feminine symbols and that's the mother 
nature that environmentalist know and 

779
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:57,581
love.
And then there's,

780
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:02,310
you know,
mother nature that gives your mother 

781
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:02,310
pants or when she's 40.

782
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:06,280
And that's the downside of mother nature
and you're pretty much stuck with that 

783
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,691
too.
Then there's you and there's all the 

784
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:10,691
useful things about you,
the sort of heroic things.

785
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,940
Technically,
you know the parts of you that would be 

786
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,340
able to confront the unknown and to 
prevail or to confront the tyrannical 

787
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,620
part of the culture and prevail.
That's the positive part,

788
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:24,770
and then there's the negative part which
is the part of you that you know very,

789
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:29,771
very well,
that's always causing trouble for you 

790
00:41:29,771 --> 00:41:31,811
and other people and it doesn't do what 
it's supposed to and is resentful and 

791
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:32,720
angry and petty and mean and ignorant 
and blind,

792
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:37,770
and I'm impulsive and rationalizing and 
all of these lovely things that people 

793
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:40,310
are more than capable of doing.
Now.

794
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:45,311
Those are all archetypes and so there 
aren't good types because there are 

795
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:50,981
fundamental.
They're the fundamental personalities 

796
00:41:50,981 --> 00:41:51,290
that we use to orient ourselves in life.

797
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,360
I guess that's the best way of thinking 
about it.

798
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,850
Now what,
when you talked about an archetype,

799
00:41:55,851 --> 00:42:00,851
it's kind of complicated because 
sometimes he talks about them as the 

800
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,210
instincts and sometimes he talks about 
them and his images and sometimes he 

801
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,570
talks about them as stories,
but the best way to contend with that is

802
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:07,970
to understand that there are all of 
those at the same time.

803
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,460
So for example,
if you go to a romance,

804
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,910
which is a kind of architectural story,
you go to a romantic comedy,

805
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:18,650
say that means you know the protagonists
have a love affair,

806
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,390
and it turns out positively romantic 
comedy and architectural structure.

807
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:28,690
Well,
what other the characters do it while 

808
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:28,690
they're driven by instinct,
obviously,

809
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,440
so that's the instinctive level of the 
archetype,

810
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:35,650
and then it's a behavioral pattern 
because they're interacting with each 

811
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:39,191
other and it's a story because someone 
has selected out the major elements of 

812
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,800
the events in the way that would be most
engaging to an audience and portrayed 

813
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:44,870
them.

814
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,750
So the archetype can be all of those 
things at the same time,

815
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,960
there's no contradiction.
It just makes it a more complex 

816
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:52,960
phenomenon.
It's best,

817
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,671
again,
to think of it as a personality and 

818
00:42:57,671 --> 00:42:59,771
archetype is a personality and an 
architectural story is the manner in 

819
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:01,850
which an archetypal personality 
manifests itself across time.

820
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,540
And there's lots of archetypal stories,
and I can give you a couple of 

821
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,440
fundamental examples.
The fundamental archetype of male 

822
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,071
behavior is the dragon story is 
confronting the dragon and that's to go 

823
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:19,541
out confront the dragon,
which can be all sorts of things that 

824
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:23,021
can be the absolute unknown.
It can be the negative element of 

825
00:43:23,021 --> 00:43:26,231
femininity,
which is a dragon that stops man and 

826
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:26,231
cold all the time.
Um,

827
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:32,740
and usually what happens as a 
consequence is that the person gets a 

828
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,170
treasurer or gets a girl.
Okay.

829
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,650
The fundamental female archetype as far 
as I've been able to tell,

830
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:37,910
it's a little harder to track down.

831
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,160
It took me a long time is beauty and the
beast.

832
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,910
And the reason I figured that out,
there's a bunch of reasons,

833
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,250
but only figured it out about two years 
ago.

834
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:46,910
And I thought,
yeah,

835
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:47,810
of course,
that's it.

836
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,960
I read this book by the guys who guys 
who do data analysis at google and it's 

837
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:56,690
called a billion wicked thoughts.
It's quite an interesting book.

838
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,130
And basically what it is,
is a study of search engine behavior.

839
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,960
And you know,
I think about 18,

840
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:07,160
19 percent of search engine behavior is 
sexual in nature.

841
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,720
And so then you might think,
well,

842
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,310
what are men doing and what are women 
doing?

843
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,870
Well,
we know what men are doing.

844
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,670
They're looking at pictures of naked 
women,

845
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,870
broadly speaking,
what are women doing hot.

846
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,820
They're not looking at pictures of naked
men.

847
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,600
They're reading about sex.
So women's pornography use his literary.

848
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,910
And so I thought,
oh that's interesting.

849
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:33,911
That makes sense.
Because actually women read more 

850
00:44:33,911 --> 00:44:33,911
fiction.
Men by the way,

851
00:44:33,911 --> 00:44:33,911
women are more predisposed to read 
fiction.

852
00:44:33,911 --> 00:44:37,950
Women seem to be more interested in 
people than in things are very stable.

853
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:40,290
Cross cultural,
gender difference anyways,

854
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:44,610
so women are are reading about sex and 
you know that if you buy,

855
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,580
if you look at when I was a kid and I'm 
on holidays,

856
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,070
summer holidays,
my mom used to pack her a long,

857
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:53,610
like 30 harlequin romances.
do you know what a harlequin romances.

858
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,940
Does everybody know what a harlequin 
romances does?

859
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:59,130
Anybody not know?
Okay.

860
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,060
Most people know it's a cheap pulp.
Romance,

861
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:08,061
you know,
it's like deserving young women meets 

862
00:45:08,061 --> 00:45:11,750
dashing and somewhat distant guy.
And then he's already with someone but 

863
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,250
she doesn't deserve him.
And then she turns him.

864
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,400
And then,
you know,

865
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,630
he decides that she's actually the one 
and then he gets that she gets to have 

866
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:21,360
him and then everyone lives happily ever
after.

867
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:25,920
So that's a harlequin romance.
Now the original harlequin romances,

868
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:29,010
they published millions of these bloody 
things was just that.

869
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:31,920
And it was pretty plain,
you know,

870
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:36,921
g rated story.
But since the seventies harlequin has 

871
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:37,710
exploded and it's gone from,
you know,

872
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:42,711
g rated stories of disorder I told you 
to like triple x version and they're all

873
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:48,321
very popular and those sorts of stories 
also reflected in female use of the 

874
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:54,111
internet.
And so what you see is that they looked 

875
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:54,990
at beauty and the beast stories and 
there's five major protagonists and this

876
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:57,060
is something I think is so absolutely 
critical.

877
00:45:57,061 --> 00:46:02,061
It just killed me when I first read it.
Here's the five major guys in female x 

878
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,260
rated pornography.
Okay.

879
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,390
We're wolf.
Yeah,

880
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,130
vampire.
yeah.

881
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,130
Surgeon.
Yeah.

882
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:16,670
Billionaire pirate.
So isn't that funny man?

883
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:19,710
It just blew me over.
But you know,

884
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:24,711
it's not much different in some sense 
than the male archetypal story of 

885
00:46:24,711 --> 00:46:24,711
confronting the drag.

886
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,380
Right?
Because,

887
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:30,570
and I'll show you something from 
sleeping beauty that makes this very 

888
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,680
clear what I'll show you that today,
because you know,

889
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,710
if you think about it,
so these are kind of bad guys,

890
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,720
while the world will fund the vampire in
particular,

891
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:38,550
right?
But there's the pirate up there too,

892
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:39,240
and you might think,
well,

893
00:46:39,241 --> 00:46:43,890
why would men like that figure in 
women's archetipal sexual narratives?

894
00:46:43,891 --> 00:46:45,300
and the answer to that is,
well,

895
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,700
what the hell good is a man who can't be
dangerous,

896
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,310
right?
You think about that and you know,

897
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:53,100
this bloody theme is played out in 
romantic comedies all the time.

898
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,220
Think about there's,
there's the girl and she has a friend,

899
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,280
he's a guy,
he's kind of a guy that never grew up.

900
00:46:59,281 --> 00:47:01,680
He's usually say,
what's his name?

901
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,840
There's a comedian,
seth rogan.

902
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,990
He's usually seth rogen,
you know,

903
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,780
and he's kind of jovial,
nice,

904
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:12,790
kind of funny and he's your friend,
but he really wants to sleep with her 

905
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,790
and she knows that.

906
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,970
So she knows that he's not just her 
friend and he isn't just her friend.

907
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
He just likes to pretend that you know.
And then there's the guy that she's 

908
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,290
interested in who's not like seth rogen 
and he's got an edge to him,

909
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:24,390
you know,
and then the story is usually,

910
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,940
well it plays out.
There's an interpLay between those three

911
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:29,860
characters and you know,
the seth rogen always going,

912
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:32,080
well why doesn't she like me?
And the answer is,

913
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,960
well you just watch them for 10 minutes 
and you know why?

914
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,570
Partly because she doesn't want a 
friend.

915
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,560
she wants someone who's good for 
something and someone who's good for 

916
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,020
something is someone who's got a 
powerful edge.

917
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:49,021
And part of what happens in the,
in the female archetype is that the 

918
00:47:49,021 --> 00:47:52,390
female civilized is that at least in 
relationship to herself.

919
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,510
Okay.
So and then,

920
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,600
well,
and then as far as I'm concerned,

921
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:02,490
that's not much different,
as I said already in the male hero myth.

922
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:08,100
So I'm going to show you first,
I'm going to show you something from 

923
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:11,320
sleeping beauty.
So let me just find it here.

924
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,470
What's the universal video player?
Vlc.

925
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

926
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,910
That's the one thing.
So I got it downloaded because,

927
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:40,690
well these,
they stripped this machine every night 

928
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:40,910
and so you have to always download 
things over and over.

929
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,410
So.

930
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Okay,
so let's talk about the structure of 

931
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,891
sleeping beauty for a minute.
So there's a king and queen and uh,

932
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,380
you know,
they live in a kingdom last logically 

933
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,281
enough and they're trying to have a baby
and that doesn't work out very well.

934
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:19,210
And then all of a sudden,
you know,

935
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:22,900
after time passes they have this baby 
girl and her name is aurora.

936
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:26,890
So that sort of a reference to the sky 
obviously.

937
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,980
Right.
And you often see with archetypical 

938
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,550
characters that are affiliated in some 
sense with cosmic phenomena.

939
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,710
So for example,
you know,

940
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,620
kings and queens have plans,
right?

941
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:44,160
And then divine figures have halos.
Well there's not much difference between

942
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:47,950
a kate,
a crown and a halo,

943
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:51,820
and the crown is the sun.
There's a little points on it.

944
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:53,860
Those are the rays of the sun or the 
moon.

945
00:49:53,861 --> 00:49:58,861
It depends on whether the crown is made 
out of gold or silver because gold is a 

946
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:00,220
solar metal and silver is a lunar metal.

947
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,170
And so when something is associated with
the cosmos,

948
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:08,350
that means that it's gone from the 
spirit purely personal to the,

949
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,720
to the,
to the impersonal or the transpersonal 

950
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,640
or the architectural and archetipal 
wouldn't be not your father,

951
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:19,090
but the father as such,
like the spirit of the father,

952
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:21,430
not your mother,
but the spirit of the mother as such.

953
00:50:21,431 --> 00:50:23,350
And so when you have the king and the 
queen,

954
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:28,351
you have the sun and the moon.
You have the ruler of the night day 

955
00:50:28,351 --> 00:50:28,351
scar,
the ruler of the night sky.

956
00:50:28,351 --> 00:50:30,860
You are the ruler over everything that 
the light touches.

957
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:34,790
And you have the transpersonal fingers 
of mother and father.

958
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:39,791
Okay?
So now you see this in lots of movies 

959
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:45,340
and hero stories in comic books.
So the most commonly portrayed pattern 

960
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:48,830
is that the hero has two sets of 
parents,

961
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,870
right?
Harry potter,

962
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:55,610
he's got the dursleys and they make them
live under the staircase.

963
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,330
And then he has his brother,
cousin.

964
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:02,570
What's his name?
What's that?

965
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:04,190
Dudley?
Yeah,

966
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:05,180
yeah,
yeah,

967
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:09,550
yes.
The loan version of doug douglas.

968
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,140
And you know,
he's a bad brother.

969
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,720
So they're actually the argument.
Hostile brothers,

970
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,030
Harry Potter,
hero in adversary,

971
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,900
and then he's got his ordinary parents 
and those are the parents that,

972
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,520
well,
they're real ordinary.

973
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:25,090
They live in an english suburb and 
they're extraordinarily conservative,

974
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:30,140
narrow minded.
They don't want anything to do with 

975
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,410
anything magic whatsoever.
And then he has his heavenly parents who

976
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:32,390
are his magic parents,
right?

977
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:37,391
And they come back and spirit for them 
now and then throughout the movie when 

978
00:51:37,391 --> 00:51:40,600
he really needs them.
So superman go to his earthy parents in 

979
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,110
his heavenly parents,
right?

980
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,400
If you go into onto wikipedia and you 
look up orphan hero,

981
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,430
I think they have a hundred and 60 of 
them listed,

982
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:53,480
so same motif over and over.
And the reason for that is,

983
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,670
well first of all,
when you're a teenager,

984
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:57,130
one thing you think are,
is,

985
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,100
are these really my parents?
Right?

986
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:05,740
And so an answer to that is yes and no.
And it's yes in that.

987
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,960
Well obviously from a strict immediate 
biological perspective,

988
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:18,770
they're your parents,
but from an architectural perspective 

989
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:18,770
it's like,

990
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:19,900
well

991
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,530
you have parents going back three and a 
half billion years.

992
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,770
Your parents or just the latest in a 
very,

993
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:28,370
very,
very,

994
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:32,570
very long line of parents and so the 
reason you call your father,

995
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:37,571
dad or father,
whatever you happen to call them is 

996
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,320
because it's in recognition of the fact 
that the role you,

997
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:43,070
the relationship with you do you have 
with him to some degree isn't personal.

998
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:45,410
It's Archetipal.
He's the father.

999
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,670
He plays that role for you and you know,
you can even tell them when he's playing

1000
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:52,190
in property because you might tell your 
friends,

1001
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,960
you know,
my,

1002
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:55,700
I don't have a very good father.
It's like,

1003
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:57,020
well,
how the hell do you know that,

1004
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:02,380
you know,
it started like you've got this idea in 

1005
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,001
your mind about what a good father would
be like and if he's not doing that then 

1006
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:04,001
it's not him,
you know,

1007
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:06,530
subject to your teenage and childhood 
misinterpretations.

1008
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:11,530
And you know,
I have an awful mother all compared to 

1009
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:11,530
what?
Well,

1010
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:12,860
compared to the ideal mother,
while you might say,

1011
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:15,560
well just who is this ideal mother?
Well,

1012
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:18,140
you can see her in religious 
representations all the time.

1013
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:21,050
So in christianity for example,
you see you're represented as the virgin

1014
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:25,530
mary who is the perfect mother and 
that's why she's a holy figure and she's

1015
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:27,450
a holy figure apartment,
archetypical figure,

1016
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:30,210
let's say,
because any society that doesn't worship

1017
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:35,211
the mother and the infant dies,
it has to be sacred because everybody 

1018
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,480
starts,
everyone has that relationship and if 

1019
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,390
the society doesn't support it properly 
and value it properly,

1020
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:45,090
then well then there's something 
seriously wrong with this society.

1021
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:50,750
So now sleeping duty,
king and queen baby.

1022
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,130
okay.
So we've got the.

1023
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,370
We've got the familial trial going 
there.

1024
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,280
So then they decided they're going to 
chrisner they're going to name her,

1025
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:05,300
not sort of when she becomes an 
individual and they make a mistake when 

1026
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,490
they're going to christener.
What's the mistake you remember?

1027
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,080
How many of you have seen sleeping 
beauty?

1028
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,930
Yes.
And how many of you have it?

1029
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,540
Okay.
So

1030
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,720
of those who haven't,
have you seen other disney movies?

1031
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,560
Have you seen other disney movies?
Lion king.

1032
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:22,970
Okay.
Anything other than that?

1033
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:29,120
Okay.
Is there anybody here who's never seen 

1034
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,120
an animated disney disney movie?

1035
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:30,690
Okay.
Okay.

1036
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:36,470
Well,
so you see how densely there wasn't 

1037
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:38,301
anyone as far as I can tell.
You see how densely distributed 

1038
00:54:38,301 --> 00:54:39,000
throughout the culture those stories 
are,

1039
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:39,930
you know,
even though they,

1040
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:40,590
you know,
they're very,

1041
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:42,480
very old stories,
but even in a movie for them,

1042
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:44,530
they're quite old for movies.
Okay.

1043
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:49,550
So the mistake they make is they don't 
invite the evil queen to the 

1044
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:50,810
christening.
That's a multifacet.

1045
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
But obviously there's the dot tannic 
undertone to that and you know that 

1046
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,700
she's got these black horns that she 
wears,

1047
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,880
like she's got this kate that's 
basically on fire.

1048
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:04,881
I mean,
you can tell that she's an evil person 

1049
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:04,881
and so she's an archetype.
She's the,

1050
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,260
she's the archetype of the negative 
feminine actually.

1051
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,390
And it's a very,
very smart story.

1052
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:11,370
You think,
well,

1053
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:14,220
why would you invite something like that
to your daughter's christening?

1054
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:15,990
Especially if you'd been waiting for her
forever.

1055
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:18,060
And she's a real princess and 
everything's perfect.

1056
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,200
It's like,
okay,

1057
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,060
here's another story.
So as another archetypal story.

1058
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:28,080
So there's these kids and their mother 
gets their father,

1059
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:31,530
I think it's divorced,
separates or his wife dies or whatever.

1060
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:36,770
And so he picks up with this new woman 
and she decides she doesn't really like 

1061
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:38,130
these kids very much.
And that happens a lot by the way.

1062
00:55:38,131 --> 00:55:43,131
So if you have a step parent,
you are 100 times more likely to be 

1063
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:48,051
physically abused.
So it's the biggest single risk factors 

1064
00:55:48,051 --> 00:55:50,520
up there with having a drunk parent.
So anyways,

1065
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:53,730
nasty little statistic.
no,

1066
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,880
it's hard enough to tolerate kids,
but when there's someone else's kids 

1067
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,970
that it makes it even more difficult and
that's a friday and observation and it's

1068
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:04,860
no joke and people are not that friendly
and there's terrible jealousy.

1069
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:05,640
Like you know,
if a,

1070
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:11,120
if a man and a woman started going out 
and the woman has children and the man 

1071
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:11,670
is jealous and the children get in the 
way,

1072
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,880
especially if they also bother him 
because maybe they're not that happy 

1073
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:16,880
that he's not actually their father.

1074
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,610
Maybe he's just a creep for,
you know,

1075
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:19,020
you never know.
Well,

1076
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:24,021
the tension that can build up in a 
situation like that can rapidly become 

1077
00:56:24,021 --> 00:56:25,120
absolutely unbearable.
it can last forever.

1078
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:30,510
So anyways,
so she tells her new husband,

1079
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:36,641
take those damn kids out in the bush and
see if you could lose them and so he's 

1080
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:40,741
not very happy with this,
but I guess he's wrapped around the 

1081
00:56:40,741 --> 00:56:41,500
finger of his new wife and not very 
bright and kind of evil on his own.

1082
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,400
So he takes the children out into the 
forest and leaves them there and so this

1083
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,860
is kind of hard on the children's.
They're out in the wilderness,

1084
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,920
which is maybe how you feel when your 
mother dies and you know your father 

1085
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,911
goes and marries a woman,
you're out in the bloody wilderness and 

1086
00:56:56,911 --> 00:57:00,030
they get lost and then they're lost and 
they're all freaked out because they're 

1087
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:03,031
lost and they're going to starve and 
wolves are going to eat them because 

1088
00:57:03,031 --> 00:57:05,461
this is like medieval europe forest and 
it's full of wolves and the people and 

1089
00:57:05,461 --> 00:57:09,100
so and they're wandering around out 
there and they come across a gingerbread

1090
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:09,640
house.

1091
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:13,300
Now if you're a skepTical person and 
you're not naive,

1092
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,110
the first thing you think is this is too
good to be true.

1093
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:17,890
It's like,
yeah,

1094
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:18,820
house.
Okay,

1095
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:20,320
fine.
A shack maybe,

1096
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:23,260
or even a lean to.
Sure that could happen,

1097
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,020
but a house that's also made out of 
candy,

1098
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:27,430
it's like,
nah,

1099
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:30,520
there's something going on there that's 
not so good.

1100
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,650
You know the kind of person that's 
really nice to you,

1101
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,900
but really isn't your member.
Again,

1102
00:57:34,901 --> 00:57:37,420
the Harry Potter series,
remember that woman?

1103
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,090
She was a bureaucrat.
Channel those plates of kittens.

1104
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,480
Rich delores.
Delores means sad,

1105
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:45,060
right?
Umbrage means to take offense.

1106
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:50,130
So she's the sad woman who takes a fence
and she got all these pictures of 

1107
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:53,800
kittens on her,
on plates right there on ceramic plates.

1108
00:57:53,801 --> 00:57:58,750
And so those are like hyper sentimental.
It's like a pewter plates and everything

1109
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:00,670
and we'll put them on our wall and you 
know,

1110
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:05,671
it's like really low and taste and the 
sentimentality is a facade.

1111
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:11,110
You would call that a persona of 
benevolence,

1112
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,560
but remember old dolores umbridge.
She's not exactly your benevolent type.

1113
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:15,130
in fact,
you know,

1114
00:58:15,131 --> 00:58:18,040
you let her loose on the world and 
horrible things happening.

1115
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,540
Um,
what's her name?

1116
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:22,300
The woman who wrote Harry Potter.
She got that exactly right.

1117
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:24,040
It's one of her best characters,
I think.

1118
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:29,430
So she's got that fake voice that you 
often hear people who actually don't 

1119
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:34,621
like children use when they're talking 
to children are the cutest little thing 

1120
00:58:34,621 --> 00:58:39,210
like you know,
you can actually talk to children and 

1121
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:40,000
they actually liked that and then they 
don't think that,

1122
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:45,170
you know,
you're possessed by something that they 

1123
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,390
should run away from as fast as 
possible.

1124
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:50,050
Anyways,
so a hansel and greTel,

1125
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,630
the woman comes out and she's all nice 
and she said,

1126
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:54,160
oh children,
you're lost in the forest.

1127
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,780
Why don't you come in and have some 
ginger bread?

1128
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,320
And so then she puts little pencil in a 
cage,

1129
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:04,740
like a bird cage I think.
And she gets gradle to do all the 

1130
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:04,740
slavery stuff,
you know,

1131
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,220
so she's not so nice.
And then everyday she goes,

1132
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:10,540
she's stuffing on well with gingerbread 
and then she goes and feels little hats.

1133
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:15,541
Have legs,
see if he's nice and pumps so that she 

1134
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:15,541
can throw them in the stove.
ANita.

1135
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:19,050
And what that means is that beware of 
people who are too nice to you because 

1136
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:23,311
what they're trying to do is devour you.
And it's the prime dictum of freudian 

1137
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:27,140
psychopathology.
If you have a parent now,

1138
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:32,141
freud concentrated mostly on mothers 
because mothers are more likely to do 

1139
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:35,651
this because for a variety of reasons 
that we're not going to talk about 

1140
00:59:35,651 --> 00:59:36,680
probably because they are oriented 
towards babies,

1141
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:41,030
but whatever.
If you're too nice to your child and you

1142
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:43,580
do everything for them,
what happens to them?

1143
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,810
Well then they can't do anything for 
themselves.

1144
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:53,020
And so then what happens?
Well then they live in your basement 

1145
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:53,020
till they're 50,
you know,

1146
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:55,880
and then they get irritated one day and 
they shoot up dawson college.

1147
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:01,750
So there's a deep metaphor in the story 
and the story is if it's too damn good 

1148
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:06,881
to be true,
it's probably aiming at your 

1149
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:06,881
destruction.
Okay.

1150
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:08,660
Now back to sleeping beauty.
So sleeping beauty,

1151
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,780
aurora is going to be christened and 
they decided not to invite the evil 

1152
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,010
queen to the christening.
Now that's not a very good idea.

1153
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:20,630
One time I had,
this is a composite client,

1154
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:24,680
so this person,
all she wanted to do with sleep,

1155
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,760
so she'd sleep like 16,
17 hours a day and she was doing that 

1156
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,040
partly sleeping pills because it's hard 
to sleep that much.

1157
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:33,410
But left her own devices,
she would just sleep.

1158
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,700
Now you might say,
well why would someone want to do that?

1159
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:39,500
And then you could say,
well,

1160
01:00:39,501 --> 01:00:44,501
for the same reason that people drink 
themselves into unconsciousness and 

1161
01:00:44,501 --> 01:00:44,501
oblivion,
which is like,

1162
01:00:44,501 --> 01:00:49,181
it's painful to be conscious,
especially when your life isn't going 

1163
01:00:49,181 --> 01:00:49,181
that well,
maybe you're afraid of things.

1164
01:00:49,181 --> 01:00:53,710
And so why be awakened suffered,
wouldn't even be unconscious and not 

1165
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:58,061
suffer.
And so that was basically her idea and 

1166
01:00:58,061 --> 01:00:58,061
she was,
she was a vegetarian,

1167
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,320
um,
and she was terrified of butcher shops 

1168
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,530
and she was terrified of raw meat and 
that was logical because she was sort of

1169
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:11,531
terrified of life.
And if you're going to be terrified of 

1170
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:11,531
life,
you really think about,

1171
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:14,711
it's the whole bloody raw meat part of 
life that you're more or less terrified 

1172
01:01:14,711 --> 01:01:18,221
by it.
So that was very concretized in her 

1173
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:20,830
situation.
And so I used to take her to 

1174
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:22,541
supermarkets through the raw meat 
section because that's what you do in 

1175
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:23,330
psychotherapy in case any of you want 
psychotherapy,

1176
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,670
you have to do the thing you least want 
to do.

1177
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,360
And so that's not particularly fun.
that's the gateway to enlightenment.

1178
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:32,380
You walked through the gate where you 
least wanted,

1179
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:37,860
well,
so now you know why people aren't 

1180
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:37,860
enlightened because it's not all fun and
games and follow your bliss and all that

1181
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,731
nonsense.
It's like figure out what you're afraid 

1182
01:01:42,731 --> 01:01:42,860
of and avoiding and confronted 
voluntarily.

1183
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:48,340
So anyways,
I got a little background from her and 

1184
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,110
her mother who I met,
who is definitely the evil queen.

1185
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:55,010
I mean she yelled at me for like 45 
minutes in my office.

1186
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,230
It was really quite remarkable.
I hadn't had anyone.

1187
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:02,530
I've only had one other person yelled at
me in my office ever and she was also 

1188
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:04,340
definitely an evil queen,
but this woman,

1189
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:08,540
she was just something else like it was 
just jaw dropping to watch her perform.

1190
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:11,390
And she used to phone up my client all 
the time,

1191
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:14,300
three or four times a day and tell her 
how stupid and useless she was.

1192
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:19,300
And so if you,
if you have parents that phone you up 

1193
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:19,980
every day and tell you how stupid and 
useless you are,

1194
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:24,981
then it's perfectly within your rights 
to not talk to them because that's what 

1195
01:02:24,981 --> 01:02:26,040
they should be telling you.
So then you can say,

1196
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,250
well how about if I call you instead of 
you calling me?

1197
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:32,190
And how about if it's once every two 
weeks instead of three times a day?

1198
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:37,340
And how about if you say anything nasty,
I just hang up and then I don't talk to 

1199
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:37,340
you for a month.
And then you might say,

1200
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,690
well I couldn't do that to my mother.
And then I would say,

1201
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:43,380
well that's because she already won.
So anyways,

1202
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,280
this girl,
her mother loved her to death when she 

1203
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:49,560
was little,
she was perfect.

1204
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:52,260
She was a princess when she was little.
But then of course you hit puberty,

1205
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:57,510
you know,
and then that's the end of the whole 

1206
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:59,091
princess thing because then of course 
you want to go out and have a life and 

1207
01:02:59,091 --> 01:02:59,850
maybe you know,
associate with boys and do all that sort

1208
01:02:59,851 --> 01:03:00,150
of thing.

1209
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:03,000
That's not the least bit child princess 
light.

1210
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:08,001
And that's when everything broke down 
and started to go in a very,

1211
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:13,311
very bad direction and that was partly 
because her mom didn't want to invite 

1212
01:03:13,311 --> 01:03:17,691
the evil queen to her little daughter's 
life because the evil queen is the 

1213
01:03:17,691 --> 01:03:19,190
negative part of nature.
And like if you,

1214
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:22,170
if you have a little girl,
well the probability that she's going to

1215
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:27,171
grow up and be a teenager and then a 
woman is pretty high unless you do 

1216
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:27,810
something to seriously interfere with 
that which you might.

1217
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:33,190
And so you bloody well better be 
prepared for that when she's three and 

1218
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:36,150
not treat her like she's someone whose 
feet are never going to touch the earth.

1219
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,470
You have to have the whole element of 
life in there.

1220
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:41,630
Right.
I had another client,

1221
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:46,880
her parents taught her that adults were 
angels and I don't mean metaphorically.

1222
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:51,690
They actually taught her that and in 
doing so,

1223
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,750
they set her up for serious 
posttraumatic stress disorder,

1224
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:59,751
which she had for about five years 
because she ran into someone who wasn't 

1225
01:03:59,751 --> 01:03:59,751
an angel.
Surprise,

1226
01:03:59,751 --> 01:04:03,030
surprise.
And all he did do her roughly speaking,

1227
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,490
was looking at her like he wanted to 
kill her.

1228
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:06,900
And you think,
well,

1229
01:04:06,901 --> 01:04:08,790
nobody could be traumatized like that.
It's like,

1230
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:09,210
well,
hey,

1231
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:11,670
probably no one's ever looked at you 
like that,

1232
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:13,680
so don't be so sure.
But b,

1233
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:18,000
if they did look at you like that and 
you thought that adults were angels,

1234
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:21,480
then you were pretty much nicely set up 
to have posttraumatic stress disorder.

1235
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:26,930
So anyways,
you might think that you're doing your 

1236
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:27,960
children a big favor by keeping the evil
queen out if their nursery,

1237
01:04:27,961 --> 01:04:32,961
but you know,
you might let them see a glimpse of her 

1238
01:04:32,961 --> 01:04:33,840
now and then so they can get used to the
fact that she exists.

1239
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:39,260
You know?
And I guess that's why children have 

1240
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:39,260
pets and part,
right?

1241
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:39,630
Because like mike's,
they don't last very long.

1242
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:44,660
So you have a live mouse for awhile and 
then you have a dead mouse and that's 

1243
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:48,021
not very good.
But then there's some things that you 

1244
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:48,021
get accustomed to while you're doing 
that.

1245
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:52,731
And maybe it's not so good to protect 
your children from that because they're 

1246
01:04:52,731 --> 01:04:53,730
going to have to grow up and survive in 
the awful world.

1247
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:58,410
And your job isn't to make them happy.
Your job is to make them able to survive

1248
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:01,410
in the nasty real world anyways.
okay,

1249
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:03,750
so that's what happens with sleeping 
beauty at the beginning.

1250
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:08,730
It's like hansel and gretel and then 
evil queen shows up anyways because good

1251
01:05:08,731 --> 01:05:12,000
luck keeping her out of your house.
and she basically says,

1252
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:13,350
yeah,
well that's all well and good.

1253
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,270
I'm,
you know,

1254
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,190
there's nothing I can do about it,
but come puberty roughly,

1255
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,110
and the sleeping beauty,
she,

1256
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:23,470
she's going to prick your finger on a 
needle on a spinning wheel.

1257
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:28,470
So there's blood involved there so we 
don't have to use our imagination too 

1258
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:28,700
much to imagine what that means.
It's like I'm gonna,

1259
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,310
come back and then,
oh,

1260
01:05:30,311 --> 01:05:35,311
hell's gonna break loose.
And of course then the parents really 

1261
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:39,301
protect her,
which is exactly the wrong thing to do 

1262
01:05:39,301 --> 01:05:40,300
and well,
that's the sleeping beauty story.

1263
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:43,210
Of course,
the prince comes along and he eventually

1264
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,070
figures out how to solve this problem,
right?

1265
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,380
She needs him.
He's a pretty good guy.

1266
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:52,860
Then evil queen puts him in a dungeon.
It's like her basement and then she's 

1267
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,550
going to keep them.
They're telling you so old that he can't

1268
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:59,551
even ride and he's,
she's going to laugh at him as he tries 

1269
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:02,290
to leave and then he tries to leave and 
she turns into a dragon.

1270
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,070
It's like,
what the hell?

1271
01:06:03,071 --> 01:06:04,450
Why?
Why is she turning into a drag?

1272
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:06,760
But you accept that no problem.

1273
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,700
Steve mcqueen turns into a dragon.
What else would you do?

1274
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:13,260
And then she spoke fire him and he 
fights are off.

1275
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:18,261
And then he has to hack his way through 
all the forums and thistles that have 

1276
01:06:18,261 --> 01:06:22,531
gathered around the castle.
And then he wakes the girl up and the 

1277
01:06:22,531 --> 01:06:26,130
fountains come back on and everyone's 
happy and you all think that's an 

1278
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:26,130
excellent story.
So,

1279
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:30,920
and it is an excellent story,
but it's a weird story because it's an 

1280
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,110
archetypal story and you understand it 
at an architectural level.

1281
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:36,370
I mean,
let me show you some of it.

1282
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,700
and then,
and then,

1283
01:06:37,701 --> 01:06:40,270
uh,
I'll talk a little bit more about it.

1284
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:44,220
So let's look at the beginning to begin 
with.

1285
01:06:44,221 --> 01:06:44,310
So.

1286
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:46,400
Oh yeah,

1287
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:39,960
sorry.
This is,

1288
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:45,170
this is a class.
So I don't want you to actually enjoy 

1289
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:45,170
the movie.
So I'm going to play around with.

1290
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,890
Okay.
So tell me about the book.

1291
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:56,070
Is it a valuable book or not?
How do you know?

1292
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,880
Hey,
it's covered with gold and jewels for 

1293
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:01,890
what you're getting right there.
There's something valuable about this.

1294
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,880
So your property.

1295
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:12,960
Yeah,
I guess.

1296
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,000
Yeah,
it's a valuable book.

1297
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,480
Got gold and jewels.
Why or why is gold valuable?

1298
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,410
It's rare.
Yeah.

1299
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:25,530
It's like the sun looks like the sun.
What else?

1300
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:28,280
If it's morally pure gold,
why?

1301
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:31,230
Because if it does,
well it is wealthy.

1302
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:36,250
Even it's morally pure because it won't 
mix with other metals that doesn't meet 

1303
01:08:36,501 --> 01:08:41,501
with other metals.
It's imperishable and it doesn't 

1304
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:44,330
tarnish.
So it's a symbol of purity and jewels.

1305
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,280
Why are,
why are they beautiful?

1306
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,120
Invaluable.
Forget about rare.

1307
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,910
Shining.
Yeah,

1308
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:52,280
they're shiny.
But even chros can appreciate that.

1309
01:08:52,281 --> 01:08:54,140
So like what is shiny have to do with 
it?

1310
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:56,320
Do you think john sign?
Yeah.

1311
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:57,800
Reflects light.
Right?

1312
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,620
So what do you want a good person to do?
Well,

1313
01:09:00,621 --> 01:09:01,700
maybe you might say that.
Yeah.

1314
01:09:01,701 --> 01:09:03,050
Yeah.
I think they reflect light.

1315
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:08,320
And the reason it's interesting because 
the reason that crystal's how are the 

1316
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,491
way they are translucent can reflect 
light is because their internal 

1317
01:09:12,491 --> 01:09:16,001
structure or crystal is a lattice of 
molecules and then that loudness is 

1318
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:18,500
precisely replicated everywhere in the 
crystal.

1319
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:21,650
So it's one thing all the way down to 
the molecular level.

1320
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,090
And so one of the things that you might 
think is that if,

1321
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:29,140
especially if you think about that 
hierarchical model that we were talking 

1322
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:29,900
about,
is that if you were as well put together

1323
01:09:29,901 --> 01:09:34,901
as you could be and had maybe been 
subject to the right amount of heat and 

1324
01:09:34,901 --> 01:09:38,621
pressure,
that you would be the same thing at 

1325
01:09:38,621 --> 01:09:40,871
every single level of being.
And then you'd Be solid and crystalline 

1326
01:09:40,871 --> 01:09:42,050
and you would reflect light.
and so.

1327
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:49,060
So anyways,
you get a hit right off the bat that 

1328
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:49,940
this is.
That this story is valuable

1329
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:09,430
in a far away land is hysterically many 
years have they own for child fun,

1330
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:19,330
which was granted.
A doctor was for they call her yes,

1331
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,550
named her,
asked her for.

1332
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:35,580
She filled their lives with sunshine.
Then a great holiday was proclaimed 

1333
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:41,670
throughout the kingdom.
So that all of high or low state might 

1334
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:46,440
pay homage to the infant princess.
Our story is one of the most joyful day,

1335
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:05,130
good stephens to her going to use 
future.

1336
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:14,190
So these are the elements of the 
feminine and they give her various gifts

1337
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:20,290
and ramble.
Quite distressed about receiving an 

1338
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:32,910
invitation.
All right,

1339
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,600
well we're out of time.
I'll show you a bunch more this next 

1340
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,200
next class and we'll see what it means.
