1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you today about what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think is a relatively new way of looking</v>

2
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>at your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe even more broadly than that in</v>

3
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:15.881
<v Speaker 1>a new way of looking at reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You all come to university,</v>

4
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:16.914
<v Speaker 1>I suppose to make your conceptions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality more sophisticated and you want </v>

5
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:24.654
<v Speaker 1>to do that because you have to live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and the more sophisticated </v>

6
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:28.944
<v Speaker 1>your conceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less likely you'll encounter tragic </v>

7
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>or harmful circumstances that you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be unable to deal with.</v>

8
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.653
<v Speaker 1>It really matters if you know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking and you know how to </v>

9
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:42.084
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

10
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Over the last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say there's been a revolution in</v>

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.063
<v Speaker 1>psychology and the revolution has </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved a transformation in the way </v>

12
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:57.690
<v Speaker 1>that we look at the world and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want to talk to you about today.</v>

13
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I've entitled this talk reality and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacred.</v>

14
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.923
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange title for a talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern people because we don't really </v>

15
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:05.244
<v Speaker 1>understand what the sacred means unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>we live within a worldview that says </v>

16
00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say archaic,</v>

17
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>but at least traditional for modern free</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

18
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.553
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally liberal people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the sacred is anachronistic </v>

19
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>or if not anachronistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least incomprehensible.</v>

20
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.713
<v Speaker 1>So I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to start with a story from the </v>

21
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:26.334
<v Speaker 1>Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a scene in the old testament </v>

22
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.123
<v Speaker 1>when the ancient Hebrews are moving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ark of the covenant and the Ark of the </v>

23
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:32.694
<v Speaker 1>covenant is a device that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufactured in order to contain the </v>

24
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:37.944
<v Speaker 1>word of God and there was a rule among </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancient Hebrews which was you were </v>

25
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>not to touch the Ark of the covenant no </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what,</v>

26
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.563
<v Speaker 1>and there's a story in the old testament</v>
<v Speaker 1>were the bearers of the Ark of the </v>

27
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>covenant.</v>

28
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.383
<v Speaker 1>They used to carry it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bearers of the Ark of the covenant </v>

29
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.283
<v Speaker 1>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a man reaches out to steady it and </v>

30
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>when he touches it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God strikes them dead and modern.</v>

31
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>People look at a story like that and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing they think is a that seems a</v>

32
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:07.494
<v Speaker 1>little bit harsh on the part of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that the man was attempting to do </v>

33
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:11.724
<v Speaker 1>something that he believed was good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what the story is designed to </v>

34
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>indicate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

35
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>is that there are certain things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you touch at your peril,</v>

36
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 1>regardless of your intentions and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you touch at your peril,</v>

37
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>regardless of your intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most cultures regard as sacred,</v>

38
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>as untouchable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make a case for you today that</v>

39
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.693
<v Speaker 1>those things exist and also why they </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist and why it's necessary for you to </v>

40
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>know that they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would also say that if you're properly</v>

41
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:43.374
<v Speaker 1>educated in the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to the </v>

42
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>humanities which are in some conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble at the moment,</v>

43
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.543
<v Speaker 1>what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what essentially happens to you is that </v>

44
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:53.154
<v Speaker 1>you're introduced in a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>secular way to the concept of the </v>

45
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>sacred.</v>

46
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>You're here in the university to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the eternal values of humankind,</v>

47
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.153
<v Speaker 1>and I think that people who tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that those values do not exist or that </v>

48
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>they're endlessly debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you an an unbelievable disservice?</v>

49
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to tell you first how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the world.</v>

50
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.083
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would be a Newtonian view of the </v>

51
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:19.924
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Newtonian and deterministic and </v>

52
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.983
<v Speaker 1>it's a worldview that dominated </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology and economics and </v>

53
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:30.331
<v Speaker 1>anthropology and political science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You name it for probably 400 years,</v>

54
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's coming to a crashing halt in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 50 years,</v>

55
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>and the consequence of that consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that have been manifested in a number</v>

56
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:39.904
<v Speaker 1>of domains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old world presuppositions or </v>

57
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is made out of objects.</v>

58
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the objects,</v>

59
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.193
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are in front of you as a </v>

60
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:57.391
<v Speaker 1>consequence of seeing the objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about what to do and after you</v>

61
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>think about what to do in presence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the objects you act.</v>

62
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Now that seems self evident because when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the world,</v>

63
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.863
<v Speaker 1>there are the objects are and it appears</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you that you see them and then you </v>

64
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>think about them and then you act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a real problem with that.</v>

65
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.013
<v Speaker 1>First problem is use half your brain to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see literally human visual Cortex is </v>

66
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:27.904
<v Speaker 1>very large part of your brain and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason that the visual cortex is so </v>

67
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:35.791
<v Speaker 1>large is that seeing is as far as we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell actually impossible now,</v>

68
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>the fact that seeing perception is </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible,</v>

69
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.063
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't discovered by psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't discovered by </v>

70
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:42.574
<v Speaker 1>philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was discovered by people who are </v>

71
00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:45.794
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were working on artificial </v>

72
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificially intelligent machines.</v>

73
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>The presupposition of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were making intelligent machines was the</v>

74
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:55.804
<v Speaker 1>hardest part of interacting with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is figuring out what to do once </v>

75
00:04:58.811 --> 00:04:59.644
<v Speaker 1>you see the objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it turned out that making machines </v>

76
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:02.884
<v Speaker 1>that could see objects was impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that </v>

77
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>boundaries between objects are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>

78
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 1>They're not obvious at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

79
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to understand how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we separate things up at all.</v>

80
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about yourself,</v>

81
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>when you look in the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see yourself as an object.</v>

82
00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>You see your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see your nose,</v>

83
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.930
<v Speaker 1>you see your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see your body,</v>

84
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty much what you see when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at other people,</v>

85
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't all there is to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

86
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>that's hardly any of what there is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

87
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>so you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

88
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 1>you exist at the level of the quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>particle.</v>

89
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.533
<v Speaker 1>You can't perceive that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people didn't know that until 75 years </v>

90
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Above that level,</v>

91
00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:45.604
<v Speaker 1>you exist at an atomic level and then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular level and then you exist at </v>

92
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.464
<v Speaker 1>the level of complex organs and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions between those organs and </v>

93
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:54.634
<v Speaker 1>then you and then your family and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the groups that your family belonged to </v>

94
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.943
<v Speaker 1>and then the ecosystem that the groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your are that that all your groups </v>

95
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 1>belong to and on and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on and so forth until what it is that</v>

96
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 1>you are can expand to encompass </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually anything.</v>

97
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at yourself,</v>

98
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.903
<v Speaker 1>you don't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see yourself at a certain level of </v>

99
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the world,</v>

100
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>you see yourself at a certain level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>

101
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.323
<v Speaker 1>but all those other levels are equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>real and equally relevant and Lee in </v>

102
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:28.454
<v Speaker 1>fact have very little idea how it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're only able to see what you </v>

103
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:31.454
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

104
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Almost nothing has obvious boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this has real world consequences.</v>

105
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.063
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that's merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract the technical term for this </v>

106
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:43.384
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem of how to bind your </v>

107
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:45.334
<v Speaker 1>perceptions to limit them is called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frame problem framing problem was </v>

108
00:06:48.551 --> 00:06:53.470
<v Speaker 1>discovered about 40 years ago and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher Daniel Dennett called it the</v>

109
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:57.520
<v Speaker 1>most important philosophical discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a discovery of the last 50 years.</v>

110
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.010
<v Speaker 1>The frame problem emerges to cause all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of trouble for people.</v>

111
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.380
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Henry Ford invented the automobile,</v>

112
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.620
<v Speaker 1>well at least invented the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedure of building the automobile.</v>

113
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.833
<v Speaker 1>What Ford presumed was that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>building an efficient means of </v>

114
00:07:14.621 --> 00:07:17.830
<v Speaker 1>transporting people from one place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

115
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 1>There were other unintended consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>affords discovery.</v>

116
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.153
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it happened to be a great supporter </v>

117
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:27.944
<v Speaker 1>of fascism and the reason that he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporter of fascism bit wasn't because </v>

118
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:32.144
<v Speaker 1>he regarded the Fascia fascist political</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure as a logical extension of the </v>

119
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 1>efficient methods that he'd used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assemble vehicles.</v>

120
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So his motive production was instantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifested in a political philosophy.</v>

121
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now 2009,</v>

122
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 1>100 years after the invention of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>automobile,</v>

123
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.693
<v Speaker 1>we've discovered some other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the car was other than a place to move </v>

124
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:58.310
<v Speaker 1>people from point a to point b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

125
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the automobile and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal combustion engine are among the</v>

126
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:03.524
<v Speaker 1>most effective technologies ever devised</v>
<v Speaker 1>to transform the nature of the </v>

127
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere to heat up the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

128
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 1>the car is completely transformed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of cities,</v>

129
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.453
<v Speaker 1>and these were all unintended </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the fact that the car </v>

130
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>was far more than what people thought it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

131
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>You can say that about any technological</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

132
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 1>No one knew what TV would do to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>

133
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:25.094
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one knew what the Internet would do </v>

134
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>to the music industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that you interact with is far</v>

135
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>more complicated than you see.</v>

136
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

137
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:38.650
<v Speaker 1>The most ancient ideas we have about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of reality make are predicated on</v>

138
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:42.040
<v Speaker 1>a certain presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the presupposition is this.</v>

139
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.710
<v Speaker 1>There's two fundamental modes of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>that characterize reality.</v>

140
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.750
<v Speaker 1>One is the absolute and absolute is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sum total of everything,</v>

141
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 1>so if you think about things in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>most possible form,</v>

142
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>if you think of the things in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of potential variations,</v>

143
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 1>you can think about that as one pool of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

144
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.163
<v Speaker 1>It appears classically that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded their encounters with the </v>

145
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:08.514
<v Speaker 1>absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has all those multiple levels of </v>

146
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:11.244
<v Speaker 1>being that are beyond your perceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity as equivalent to an encounter </v>

147
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:15.174
<v Speaker 1>with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know that in the Islamic </v>

148
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:18.264
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's against the rules to make a graven </v>

149
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>image of any sort of Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

150
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that you're not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make an image,</v>

151
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 1>and among the ancient Hebrews the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>was very similar.</v>

152
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:27.563
<v Speaker 1>The Dow is say that you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>confuse the moon with a finger pointing </v>

153
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:31.944
<v Speaker 1>to the moon and what all that means is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the absolute is always something </v>

154
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 1>that transcends the finite frame that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you place around your perceptions.</v>

155
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

156
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 1>representing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making statues of it or idolizing it,</v>

157
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:46.344
<v Speaker 1>you lose your connection with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute because you've turned it into </v>

158
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>something that's understandable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>concrete.</v>

159
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Part of the wisdom traditions that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world still maintains.</v>

160
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.573
<v Speaker 1>Make the constant moral presupposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should always be aware of what </v>

161
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:04.494
<v Speaker 1>it is that transcends both your </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding and your perceptions and </v>

162
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 1>you should keep firmly in mind that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>

163
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people talk about God in the modern</v>

164
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:13.194
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to think about something </v>

165
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:14.664
<v Speaker 1>that's more a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That more has more of the </v>

166
00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:17.094
<v Speaker 1>characteristics of a being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose that's where most of the </v>

167
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:21.210
<v Speaker 1>debate about religious reality comes in.</v>

168
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.493
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that there's an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's outside of your perceptual </v>

169
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 1>capacity seems to be to be merely a </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement of fact.</v>

170
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Especially given what we know now about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of perception.</v>

171
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>That the phenomena always transcends the</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner in which you frame it.</v>

172
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.733
<v Speaker 1>We've also come to understand that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only does reality have multiple levels </v>

173
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:43.680
<v Speaker 1>of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in order to perceive it,</v>

174
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.850
<v Speaker 1>you have to stand inside multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>frames.</v>

175
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 1>This is a picture of a French city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a walled city.</v>

176
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.503
<v Speaker 1>Now the walls are there to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in and the walls are there to </v>

177
00:10:58.501 --> 00:10:59.334
<v Speaker 1>keep what isn't in the walls out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you can think about that as a </v>

178
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.233
<v Speaker 1>protective structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to tell you how it is that </v>

179
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 1>you still inhabit a walled city and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what that means.</v>

180
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.053
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about this room and I'm going </v>

181
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:16.854
<v Speaker 1>to tell you how it is that this room </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows you to see what it is that you </v>

182
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:20.904
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

183
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're interacting with a computer,</v>

184
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't interact with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

185
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 1>You interact with the keyboard and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>

186
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.243
<v Speaker 1>If the computer crashes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you interact with the computer and </v>

187
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:32.514
<v Speaker 1>you find that as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very annoying because you don't really </v>

188
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:38.880
<v Speaker 1>understand the computer very well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't actually see how complex it is</v>

189
00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 1>until it stops working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time when you're interacting</v>

190
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:44.970
<v Speaker 1>with the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing things with the world.</v>

191
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:49.380
<v Speaker 1>You're interacting with it in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces some consequence that you want,</v>

192
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.513
<v Speaker 1>and that means in part that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions are always framed by what </v>

193
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:54.094
<v Speaker 1>you want and that's actually one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why the world isn't just made </v>

194
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:57.244
<v Speaker 1>out of objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is made out of things you use </v>

195
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.453
<v Speaker 1>and things that get in your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're always applying a frame like </v>

196
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:05.254
<v Speaker 1>that to the world in order to simplify </v>
<v Speaker 1>it enough so that you can understand it </v>

197
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.343
<v Speaker 1>and you're aided in this process by all </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of processes you really don't </v>

198
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 1>notice because when you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

199
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:13.841
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

200
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:14.674
<v Speaker 1>there are the objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a thousand things going on </v>

201
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 1>before you make that judgment.</v>

202
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>So we'll look at this room.</v>

203
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.520
<v Speaker 1>When you walked in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room tells you what to do.</v>

204
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 1>The reason it tells you what to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all the seats are pointed in the</v>

205
00:12:27.851 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 1>same direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all slanted in a particular way.</v>

206
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 1>When you walk in here and there's other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people sitting,</v>

207
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.970
<v Speaker 1>you can see all their faces point to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>

208
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>People's faces point towards what </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests the room is set up to make you</v>

209
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:41.344
<v Speaker 1>face the front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory behind the room is that the </v>

210
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 1>thing that's interesting in the room is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening at the front.</v>

211
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.953
<v Speaker 1>It's a theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening at the front is a </v>

212
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 1>drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

213
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Because theater is there to promote and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and undergird drama.</v>

214
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.293
<v Speaker 1>A lecture is a dramatic act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The room tells you what to do so you </v>

215
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 1>don't have to think about what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you come into a room like this,</v>

216
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.103
<v Speaker 1>you can just do it because the room </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells you what to do and then you can </v>

217
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:05.854
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

218
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.850
<v Speaker 1>You can sit in here in relative comfort </v>
<v Speaker 1>and listen to this lecture.</v>

219
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Why can you sit in here in relative </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort?</v>

220
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people around you have been </v>

221
00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:19.320
<v Speaker 1>relatively carefully selected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

222
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.500
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of analysis of their 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>years in school.</v>

223
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.513
<v Speaker 1>The university has made a determination </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they know how to sit down and </v>

224
00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:26.604
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hypothetically they're intelligent </v>

225
00:13:28.711 --> 00:13:29.544
<v Speaker 1>enough to understand the lecture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're very unlikely to disrupt </v>

226
00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:36.600
<v Speaker 1>the proceedings with any unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 1>outburst of emotion or motivation.</v>

227
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anybody broke one of those rules,</v>

228
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.013
<v Speaker 1>you can be sure that your eyes would </v>
<v Speaker 1>move very rapidly away from me and </v>

229
00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:43.104
<v Speaker 1>directly towards the person who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>causing the trouble because that would </v>

230
00:13:45.841 --> 00:13:46.920
<v Speaker 1>take center stage.</v>

231
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.403
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this room is actually supported by a </v>

232
00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:53.280
<v Speaker 1>million invisible processes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

233
00:13:53.281 --> 00:13:54.114
<v Speaker 1>while you're sitting in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about whether </v>

234
00:13:54.991 --> 00:13:55.824
<v Speaker 1>it's raining because there's a roof and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about whether </v>

235
00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:01.050
<v Speaker 1>the roof is going to fall in because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the presumption that the people who</v>

236
00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:01.884
<v Speaker 1>built the roof are competent and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity works because the </v>

237
00:14:04.261 --> 00:14:07.560
<v Speaker 1>electricity is the utility is run by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were competent,</v>

238
00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:10.710
<v Speaker 1>so it's almost always on buildings </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly ever burned down.</v>

239
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.693
<v Speaker 1>The electricity hardly ever fluctuates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's thousands of people out there </v>

240
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.320
<v Speaker 1>working as hard as they can diligently </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make this environment constant enough</v>

241
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.273
<v Speaker 1>so that you can ignore all the thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that you're ignoring so that </v>

242
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:24.064
<v Speaker 1>you can concentrate well enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attend to the few things that you are </v>

243
00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:29.790
<v Speaker 1>attending to while you're in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in a walled city.</v>

244
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.253
<v Speaker 1>There's multiple walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those walls protect you from what's </v>

245
00:14:33.931 --> 00:14:38.931
<v Speaker 1>outside the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it this way.</v>

246
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.943
<v Speaker 1>This is a taoist image of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people think about this as a </v>

247
00:14:46.121 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical symbol,</v>

248
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a metaphysical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievably practical symbol.</v>

249
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.663
<v Speaker 1>The Dallas believe that the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is made up essentially of </v>

250
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:01.274
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is all those things you don't </v>

251
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:05.054
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would say that chaos is all those </v>

252
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:09.890
<v Speaker 1>things that exist outside of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptual preconditions.</v>

253
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.193
<v Speaker 1>Order is all the things you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and all the places you go </v>

254
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.530
<v Speaker 1>where the things that you do produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the results that you intend,</v>

255
00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 1>and the Dallas would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you go,</v>

256
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:23.384
<v Speaker 1>it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you go has things that you </v>

257
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:26.084
<v Speaker 1>understand that or orderly and has </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you don't understand that </v>

258
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:29.504
<v Speaker 1>are chaotic and the chaotic things </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract your attention because you </v>

259
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:36.911
<v Speaker 1>already understand the orderly things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If something unexpected happened to your</v>

260
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:38.710
<v Speaker 1>nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically reacts to it,</v>

261
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 1>orients you towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes that can be catastrophic.</v>

262
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.800
<v Speaker 1>So this is an experience that some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you will have in the next four years.</v>

263
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:46.993
<v Speaker 1>Undoubtedly there's a number of you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go to medical school or to </v>

264
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:52.880
<v Speaker 1>graduate school or to law school or </v>
<v Speaker 1>business school,</v>

265
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.433
<v Speaker 1>and a certain percentage of you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the admission tests that will </v>

266
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:57.674
<v Speaker 1>determine whether or not you're able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take that path and a certain percentage </v>

267
00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:01.844
<v Speaker 1>of you will score below the 50th </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile on those tests and that will </v>

268
00:16:05.511 --> 00:16:07.880
<v Speaker 1>make and you will not be going to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

269
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.520
<v Speaker 1>And when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

270
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>you'll shake and tremble when you open </v>
<v Speaker 1>the envelope to find out your results.</v>

271
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.983
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't achieved the score that </v>

272
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:17.660
<v Speaker 1>you expected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will achieve,</v>

273
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 1>that you achieve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your world will fall apart.</v>

274
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:21.913
<v Speaker 1>And what that'll mean is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>descend from the domain of order into </v>

275
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 1>the domain of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happens to people all the time.</v>

276
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.040
<v Speaker 1>It happens to people when they develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>an illness that's serious,</v>

277
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:34.550
<v Speaker 1>that they can't control because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>their body stops becoming something they</v>

278
00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 1>can predict and starts to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they can't predict.</v>

279
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.103
<v Speaker 1>It happens to people when they're in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationship and there'll be </v>

280
00:16:41.481 --> 00:16:42.314
<v Speaker 1>trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they assumed fidelity and the person </v>

281
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:47.600
<v Speaker 1>tells them that they've had an affair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

282
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.000
<v Speaker 1>That means you didn't know who that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person was.</v>

283
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:55.810
<v Speaker 1>The future you imagine no longer exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your perceptions of people are erroneous</v>

284
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:58.310
<v Speaker 1>at some level of analysis that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

285
00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.533
<v Speaker 1>It's conceivable that you're naive </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond belief and that everything you </v>

286
00:17:02.391 --> 00:17:05.420
<v Speaker 1>believed about yourself and other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to that point is false,</v>

287
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.080
<v Speaker 1>and when the revelation occurs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>knocks out one of the walls that support</v>

288
00:17:09.081 --> 00:17:12.920
<v Speaker 1>to you and you descend accidentally into</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

289
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.860
<v Speaker 1>You'll regard that as one of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences of your life.</v>

290
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 1>When that happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain knows exactly what to do.</v>

291
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.163
<v Speaker 1>It stops thinking about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stops saving up resources for their </v>

292
00:17:23.951 --> 00:17:24.784
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It puts you in emergency preparation </v>

293
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:30.470
<v Speaker 1>mode so you're ready to do anything at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the drop of a hat because you don't know</v>

294
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:33.440
<v Speaker 1>what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your body prepares to do everything.</v>

295
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.543
<v Speaker 1>It shifts your cortisol levels up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It activates your left and right a </v>

296
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.820
<v Speaker 1>quarter sees your limbic system and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational systems are disinhibited,</v>

297
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:49.270
<v Speaker 1>turned on and you sweat and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep because the orderly structure that</v>

298
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:50.514
<v Speaker 1>you thought you inhabited that provided </v>
<v Speaker 1>you with security and direction has now </v>

299
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:54.444
<v Speaker 1>disappeared from the Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that the world is always an </v>

300
00:17:57.721 --> 00:18:01.560
<v Speaker 1>interplay between chaos and order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you live your life properly,</v>

301
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.580
<v Speaker 1>you stand with one foot in order and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot in chaos.</v>

302
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.133
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're only an order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing that's interesting ever happens </v>

303
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:10.374
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is anything but a repeat of all </v>

304
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.733
<v Speaker 1>of all the things that you already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the state that fascists desire </v>

305
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.143
<v Speaker 1>because fascist desire things to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the way they are forever and if </v>

306
00:18:21.751 --> 00:18:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you're in a that's only characterized by</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

307
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.073
<v Speaker 1>You're at sea or overwhelmed or things </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fallen apart for you and there's </v>

308
00:18:27.841 --> 00:18:30.000
<v Speaker 1>too much of everything for you to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

309
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dallas being very wise,</v>

310
00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:34.830
<v Speaker 1>people know other things as well and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know,</v>

311
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:36.780
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaos can turn into order.</v>

312
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.350
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's a white.in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the Black Paisley and they</v>

313
00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 1>know that order can turn into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why there's a black.in</v>

314
00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:49.671
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the White Paisley and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dallas believed that a meaningful life,</v>

315
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.233
<v Speaker 1>the optimally meaningful life is to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>found on the border between chaos and </v>

316
00:18:54.691 --> 00:18:57.150
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that your nervous system</v>

317
00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:57.984
<v Speaker 1>tells you exactly when you are there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a kind of place and you can tell </v>

318
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 1>when you're there because you're secure </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to be confident but not so secure</v>

319
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:09.420
<v Speaker 1>that you're bored and you're interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to be awake but not so interested</v>

320
00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:12.420
<v Speaker 1>that you're terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're in a state like that,</v>

321
00:19:12.421 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 1>when you find things interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>

322
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.383
<v Speaker 1>time slips by you and you're no longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self conscious is a medieval Christian </v>

323
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:23.990
<v Speaker 1>representation of the nature of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the outside.</v>

324
00:19:23.991 --> 00:19:28.160
<v Speaker 1>You have the Virgin Mary inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Virgin Mary.</v>

325
00:19:28.161 --> 00:19:28.994
<v Speaker 1>You have God the father and God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The father was supporting a crucifix </v>

326
00:19:32.661 --> 00:19:36.920
<v Speaker 1>with an individual on an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Christian thinking is Christ.</v>

327
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.430
<v Speaker 1>What does this image mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The walled city divides order from chaos</v>

328
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.513
<v Speaker 1>or order from nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think about nature as the thing </v>

329
00:19:52.341 --> 00:19:55.580
<v Speaker 1>that's outside of what we understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's mother nature.</v>

330
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature gives birth to all things.</v>

331
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea that's expressed in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>

332
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.040
<v Speaker 1>So the Virgin Mary is standing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother Nature.</v>

333
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.920
<v Speaker 1>Out of Mother Nature arises order and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

334
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.410
<v Speaker 1>How it's true for primates like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>

335
00:20:10.411 --> 00:20:11.244
<v Speaker 1>as much as it's true for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any social animals that are grouped </v>

336
00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:17.550
<v Speaker 1>together have to form an orderly </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure that they can inhabit together</v>

337
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.473
<v Speaker 1>that defines their boundaries and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals because otherwise they fight each </v>

338
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:24.690
<v Speaker 1>other to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the state of untrammeled nature,</v>

339
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.643
<v Speaker 1>as Hobbes pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's every man for himself and without </v>

340
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.633
<v Speaker 1>the order that tradition brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is nothing but chaos and chaos is </v>

341
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:35.670
<v Speaker 1>murderous and unproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When there's a problem with order.</v>

342
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.450
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the history of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

343
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.903
<v Speaker 1>it's a tossup whether mother nature has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been harder on us or whether our </v>

344
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>governmental traditions been harder on </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

345
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:49.983
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that the dictatorship of </v>

346
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:53.104
<v Speaker 1>Hitler killed 6 million Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>120 million people in the Second World </v>

347
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.780
<v Speaker 1>War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The you may not know that the stalinists</v>

348
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:02.614
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships in the Soviet Union killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>an estimated 60 million people in </v>

349
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:06.844
<v Speaker 1>internal repression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not counting those people who died in </v>

350
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:09.244
<v Speaker 1>the second world war and the internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>repression that characterized Mao's </v>

351
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.310
<v Speaker 1>communist China killed 100 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

352
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.313
<v Speaker 1>And so the problem with tradition is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes it's a wise king and </v>

353
00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:23.080
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's a king that eats its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>sons,</v>

354
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.393
<v Speaker 1>which means that although we need </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition to guide us and to structure </v>

355
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 1>even the manner in which we perceive the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

356
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:33.340
<v Speaker 1>our traditions can become archaic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>outdated and cruel and inhuman,</v>

357
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.100
<v Speaker 1>and as a consequence they can pose a </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat to us.</v>

358
00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:36.934
<v Speaker 1>Then chaos itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature or chaos is exactly the same </v>

359
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.343
<v Speaker 1>dichotomous structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The figure on the left is a medusa or a </v>

360
00:21:50.881 --> 00:21:51.714
<v Speaker 1>Gorgon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at them and do so as you </v>

361
00:21:54.621 --> 00:21:56.990
<v Speaker 1>probably already know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you turned to stone.</v>

362
00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.153
<v Speaker 1>The reason you turned to stone is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you look upon nature or </v>

363
00:22:02.041 --> 00:22:02.874
<v Speaker 1>chaos without your normal veils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it paralyzes you physiologically just </v>

364
00:22:08.701 --> 00:22:09.534
<v Speaker 1>like a prey animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rabbit is terrified if it sees a </v>

365
00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:16.050
<v Speaker 1>wolf for millions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings were prey animals.</v>

366
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.830
<v Speaker 1>We were probably prey animals for large </v>
<v Speaker 1>reptiles,</v>

367
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.810
<v Speaker 1>which accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

368
00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:25.290
<v Speaker 1>for the reason that it appears that </v>
<v Speaker 1>primates like us are naturally afraid of</v>

369
00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:26.550
<v Speaker 1>predatory reptiles.</v>

370
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.233
<v Speaker 1>If you're in the presence of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that violates your assumptions of </v>

371
00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:33.584
<v Speaker 1>safety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll freeze it freeze so that the </v>

372
00:22:36.081 --> 00:22:39.500
<v Speaker 1>thing that might eat you can't see you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what turns you to stone.</v>

373
00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.413
<v Speaker 1>That's nature and it's terrible aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the terrible aspect of nature can </v>

374
00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:45.614
<v Speaker 1>freeze everyone and you can be sure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be seldom taught that you will </v>

375
00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:51.290
<v Speaker 1>encounter that at some point in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

376
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.640
<v Speaker 1>The primary Buddhist dictum is that life</v>
<v Speaker 1>is suffering and what does that mean?</v>

377
00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.293
<v Speaker 1>It means that because you're finite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're surrounded by something that's </v>

378
00:23:06.501 --> 00:23:07.334
<v Speaker 1>absolute in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a battle that you can never </v>

379
00:23:09.951 --> 00:23:14.300
<v Speaker 1>win because there's always more of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that you're trying to contend with</v>

380
00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.720
<v Speaker 1>than there is with you and worse than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

381
00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.853
<v Speaker 1>and it's for this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tyrannies can't last is that the </v>

382
00:23:21.501 --> 00:23:24.290
<v Speaker 1>thing that you're contending with isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even static.</v>

383
00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:29.240
<v Speaker 1>It keeps changing so that what worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you yesterday won't necessarily work</v>

384
00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:30.074
<v Speaker 1>for you tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an l chemical version of the </v>

385
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:36.754
<v Speaker 1>Taoist Yin and Yang symbol and basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says something that's more </v>

386
00:23:39.071 --> 00:23:39.904
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says that the world is made up of </v>

387
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:43.594
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things that you can predict and </v>

388
00:23:45.231 --> 00:23:48.410
<v Speaker 1>understand and things that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict and can't understand,</v>

389
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.500
<v Speaker 1>and inside the order there's some chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inside that chaos there's some order</v>

390
00:23:52.501 --> 00:23:53.334
<v Speaker 1>and that order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some chaos and so on and so </v>

391
00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:58.190
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and equally the case for order.</v>

392
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.780
<v Speaker 1>You have mother nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of chaos,</v>

393
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.540
<v Speaker 1>sometimes positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes negative.</v>

394
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.733
<v Speaker 1>You have a representation of the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>father that's security and tyranny to </v>

395
00:24:14.191 --> 00:24:15.960
<v Speaker 1>things you'll always have to contend </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

396
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.420
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this representation,</v>

397
00:24:18.421 --> 00:24:21.150
<v Speaker 1>you have a representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

398
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.680
<v Speaker 1>at least a Christian representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual,</v>

399
00:24:23.681 --> 00:24:26.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a terrifying representation.</v>

400
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:27.623
<v Speaker 1>It's a remarkable representation because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a representation of </v>

401
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.110
<v Speaker 1>transcendence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a representation of suffering,</v>

402
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:39.030
<v Speaker 1>and it's a funny kind of representation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of suffering because the manner in which</v>

403
00:24:39.031 --> 00:24:42.270
<v Speaker 1>the story unfolds is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

404
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:43.343
<v Speaker 1>as the archetipal individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the model for individuals from a </v>

405
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.063
<v Speaker 1>psychological or mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective knows that he's limited and </v>

406
00:24:50.401 --> 00:24:54.590
<v Speaker 1>knows that he's due to both suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>and death in the garden of gifts.</v>

407
00:24:54.591 --> 00:24:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Seventy the night before his </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucifixion,</v>

408
00:24:56.371 --> 00:24:59.160
<v Speaker 1>he has an argument with God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the argument basically is a,</v>

409
00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 1>do I actually have to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is twofold.</v>

410
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.271
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

411
00:25:03.271 --> 00:25:05.400
<v Speaker 1>actually you don't have to accept your </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

412
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:06.983
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

413
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to voluntarily accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>your suffering,</v>

414
00:25:11.351 --> 00:25:13.960
<v Speaker 1>but there are consequences if you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

415
00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:17.410
<v Speaker 1>the Christian story is predicated on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that if you voluntarily accept your</v>

416
00:25:17.411 --> 00:25:19.630
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can cymbalta obviously transcended.</v>

417
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.483
<v Speaker 1>So remarkable philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also something that we have </v>

418
00:25:24.791 --> 00:25:28.510
<v Speaker 1>very good support for from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological perspective.</v>

419
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:29.763
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm treating someone who has an </v>

420
00:25:31.871 --> 00:25:32.704
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorder or panic disorder who </v>
<v Speaker 1>can go out of their house without their </v>

421
00:25:35.261 --> 00:25:36.094
<v Speaker 1>heart rate elevating and without </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsing into a panic stricken heap </v>

422
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:42.400
<v Speaker 1>without visiting the emergency ward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time their heart rate accelerates,</v>

423
00:25:42.401 --> 00:25:44.650
<v Speaker 1>every time they're in the subway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time they're in a mall,</v>

424
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:48.130
<v Speaker 1>so they're so terrified of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't even get out of their house.</v>

425
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.820
<v Speaker 1>The Way you cure that person is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them to voluntarily approach the</v>

426
00:25:51.821 --> 00:25:55.150
<v Speaker 1>things that they're afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that physiologically,</v>

427
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.450
<v Speaker 1>if I force you to accept a certain kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of challenge,</v>

428
00:25:58.451 --> 00:25:59.284
<v Speaker 1>your body will go into emergency </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation mode and you'll become </v>

429
00:26:01.451 --> 00:26:04.900
<v Speaker 1>stressed and that stress will cause you </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological damage,</v>

430
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.390
<v Speaker 1>including brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's sustained for long enough.</v>

431
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.140
<v Speaker 1>But if I present you with the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge and you accepted voluntarily,</v>

432
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.033
<v Speaker 1>your brain doesn't produce stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones and completely different </v>

433
00:26:13.631 --> 00:26:14.464
<v Speaker 1>physiological systems kick in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that people have </v>

434
00:26:17.321 --> 00:26:19.330
<v Speaker 1>evolved to modes for dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>

435
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:24.450
<v Speaker 1>One is voluntary approach and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>is panic stricken paralysis and flight.</v>

436
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.243
<v Speaker 1>In this representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that there are crowds of </v>

437
00:26:33.041 --> 00:26:33.874
<v Speaker 1>people standing in the wings of the Open</v>
<v Speaker 1>Statue Looking at the crucified </v>

438
00:26:38.681 --> 00:26:40.600
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange thing,</v>

439
00:26:40.601 --> 00:26:41.920
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still see this,</v>

440
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.180
<v Speaker 1>you still see people doing things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this that they don't notice.</v>

441
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I went to a museum in New York and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were a very large number of paintings.</v>

442
00:26:50.911 --> 00:26:51.744
<v Speaker 1>They're from the late renaissance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all religiously themed like </v>

443
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:55.890
<v Speaker 1>medieval paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except they,</v>

444
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.053
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they featured recognizable individuals </v>

445
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.810
<v Speaker 1>and people had come from all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to look at those paintings.</v>

446
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Speaker 1>They were extremely valuable paintings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

447
00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.460
<v Speaker 1>they were painted by Michelangelo or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Da Vinci.</v>

448
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:09.294
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of them was probably valued for </v>

449
00:27:10.981 --> 00:27:12.780
<v Speaker 1>reasons that are very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

450
00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.990
<v Speaker 1>something approximating hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars.</v>

451
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:17.783
<v Speaker 1>The late renaissance was the first time </v>
<v Speaker 1>in human history where human beings </v>

452
00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 1>dared to presume that sacred images </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be given an individual human face.</v>

453
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.823
<v Speaker 1>And that idea was actually what launched</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enlightenment and launched the </v>

454
00:27:29.521 --> 00:27:32.310
<v Speaker 1>development of modern culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The late renaissance thinkers.</v>

455
00:27:32.311 --> 00:27:33.144
<v Speaker 1>The artists in particular were the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to posit that there was some </v>

456
00:27:35.281 --> 00:27:40.281
<v Speaker 1>direct relationship between these sacred</v>
<v Speaker 1>images and actual people and people come</v>

457
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:41.214
<v Speaker 1>from all over the world to look at these</v>
<v Speaker 1>paintings even though they don't </v>

458
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:43.914
<v Speaker 1>understand what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you some images that </v>

459
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:48.354
<v Speaker 1>describe how the idea of the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual developed and what that </v>

460
00:27:53.641 --> 00:27:54.474
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I want to show you is </v>

461
00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:58.200
<v Speaker 1>this picture of St George and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragon.</v>

462
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Now you know the main street that runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the university is named after St</v>

463
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.333
<v Speaker 1>George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

464
00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.720
<v Speaker 1>This is a very old image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the oldest story we know,</v>

465
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.080
<v Speaker 1>which is a Mesopotamian creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Myth features a,</v>

466
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.023
<v Speaker 1>a God who confronts a reptilian monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>and makes the world as a consequence of </v>

467
00:28:20.731 --> 00:28:21.564
<v Speaker 1>the conflict.</v>

468
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.770
<v Speaker 1>He faces her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's terrifying.</v>

469
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.623
<v Speaker 1>He cuts her up into pieces and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pieces that makes the world now the </v>

470
00:28:27.151 --> 00:28:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamians 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

471
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of individuality was and what the</v>

472
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:34.464
<v Speaker 1>nature of consciousness was and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition which was dramatized </v>

473
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.530
<v Speaker 1>because these people told stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think the way we think,</v>

474
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:43.440
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an explicit philosophical,</v>

475
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 1>logical meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

476
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.903
<v Speaker 1>with philosophical processes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought in stories which is a </v>

477
00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:50.394
<v Speaker 1>natural way for people to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came to the conclusion that the </v>

478
00:28:53.281 --> 00:28:58.260
<v Speaker 1>object of their ultimate worship was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>God who confronted the dragon of chaos,</v>

479
00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.153
<v Speaker 1>cut it into pieces and made the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that idea has echo down through the </v>

480
00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:04.434
<v Speaker 1>ages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an idea that human beings have </v>

481
00:29:05.191 --> 00:29:07.320
<v Speaker 1>never lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this idea is very interesting,</v>

482
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:08.154
<v Speaker 1>so you see the castle in the background </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we already know what the castle </v>

483
00:29:10.381 --> 00:29:10.920
<v Speaker 1>stands for.</v>

484
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.753
<v Speaker 1>The castle stands for order and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>multi walled castle because everyone's </v>

485
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:19.050
<v Speaker 1>protected by multiple walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those walls are constantly breached.</v>

486
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young people,</v>

487
00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:21.174
<v Speaker 1>especially modern young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are often very cynical about the </v>

488
00:29:23.341 --> 00:29:24.174
<v Speaker 1>traditions that they inhabit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cynical about them because they </v>

489
00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:27.174
<v Speaker 1>see the fact that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically devolving into some kind </v>

490
00:29:29.461 --> 00:29:30.294
<v Speaker 1>of environmental catastrophe and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical because they're still worn </v>

491
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:35.670
<v Speaker 1>because there's still hunger there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical because often the people who are</v>

492
00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:38.490
<v Speaker 1>teaching them the traditions don't seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>to believe in them themselves.</v>

493
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.533
<v Speaker 1>And it's very easy for young people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the traditions that were and to </v>

494
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 1>notice the brakes with the truth of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter is,</v>

495
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:47.944
<v Speaker 1>is that throughout human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition has always been an acronystic </v>

496
00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:51.184
<v Speaker 1>and out of date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you see in images of St George </v>

497
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:55.810
<v Speaker 1>and the Dragon is the dragon's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>breached the walls,</v>

498
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.350
<v Speaker 1>which means that tradition is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>under attack from chaos.</v>

499
00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it is because the future is </v>

500
00:30:02.091 --> 00:30:02.924
<v Speaker 1>different than the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that the past </v>

501
00:30:04.911 --> 00:30:05.744
<v Speaker 1>should be abandoned because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned the past and you knocked on </v>

502
00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:08.944
<v Speaker 1>all your walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall into a pit of chaos and that </v>

503
00:30:11.901 --> 00:30:13.970
<v Speaker 1>classically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is indistinguishably.</v>

504
00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.073
<v Speaker 1>Indistinguishable from hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you that if you spend </v>

505
00:30:17.841 --> 00:30:18.674
<v Speaker 1>long enough in that state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll become bitter and cruel because </v>

506
00:30:21.771 --> 00:30:24.140
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens to people who suffer</v>
<v Speaker 1>endlessly.</v>

507
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.590
<v Speaker 1>St George is a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

508
00:30:27.591 --> 00:30:30.920
<v Speaker 1>When the walls come crumbling down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they always do,</v>

509
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.500
<v Speaker 1>he decides to go out and to confront the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragons.</v>

510
00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragons are very strange creatures,</v>

511
00:30:35.721 --> 00:30:37.580
<v Speaker 1>as you may have already noted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

512
00:30:37.581 --> 00:30:40.220
<v Speaker 1>they don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>

513
00:30:40.221 --> 00:30:42.860
<v Speaker 1>they have very weird propensities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

514
00:30:42.861 --> 00:30:46.880
<v Speaker 1>they hoard gold and they tend to trap </v>
<v Speaker 1>virgins in their layer,</v>

515
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.360
<v Speaker 1>which you will also admit is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange behavior for a reptile.</v>

516
00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind this is that it's very,</v>

517
00:30:54.411 --> 00:30:56.840
<v Speaker 1>very complicated idea and it's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented pictorially.</v>

518
00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.960
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that the thing that lurks </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath,</v>

519
00:30:59.961 --> 00:31:02.540
<v Speaker 1>if you look to the right of the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that there's a cave.</v>

520
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.433
<v Speaker 1>The cave goes way down into the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>and way down into the ground is the </v>

521
00:31:05.961 --> 00:31:08.540
<v Speaker 1>terrifying place that's underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

522
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.553
<v Speaker 1>The dragon crawls out from time to time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to threaten the structure of everything </v>

523
00:31:12.201 --> 00:31:13.034
<v Speaker 1>that's known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>St George comes out to confront the </v>

524
00:31:14.661 --> 00:31:17.300
<v Speaker 1>dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily overcomes it,</v>

525
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.230
<v Speaker 1>and in this image</v>

526
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.480
<v Speaker 1>rescues the virgin that the dragon has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been guardian.</v>

527
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:26.503
<v Speaker 1>It's a very complicated story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that the things that terrify </v>

528
00:31:30.261 --> 00:31:31.094
<v Speaker 1>you contain things of value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also what the image of the goal </v>

529
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:37.190
<v Speaker 1>that the dragon horns represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means something else as well.</v>

530
00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:43.030
<v Speaker 1>It means that the individual man who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to go out and confront chaos when</v>

531
00:31:44.211 --> 00:31:47.270
<v Speaker 1>tradition is crumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more likely to find a mate.</v>

532
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:54.470
<v Speaker 1>This is Jonah.</v>

533
00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Joe and I had a very weird experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was swallowed by a whale.</v>

534
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a very strange whale as you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might well note.</v>

535
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.613
<v Speaker 1>It's a medieval whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course medieval people didn't </v>

536
00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:10.360
<v Speaker 1>really know what whales were and so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were guessing what a way it was.</v>

537
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And so a whale for a mid evil person </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been a big fish,</v>

538
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:15.283
<v Speaker 1>would have been a squid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have been some monstrous </v>

539
00:32:17.081 --> 00:32:19.390
<v Speaker 1>thing like a shark that lurks in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep because they didn't have.</v>

540
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:20.493
<v Speaker 1>They weren't able to Segue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>segregate all those things out </v>

541
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:22.624
<v Speaker 1>biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their,</v>

542
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.480
<v Speaker 1>their powers of collective observation </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't that good.</v>

543
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:29.350
<v Speaker 1>So the way off of them was what lurks </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath in the darkness,</v>

544
00:32:29.351 --> 00:32:31.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea with Jonah was that now and</v>

545
00:32:31.951 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 1>then what lurks underneath in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkest rises up to swallow you,</v>

546
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:38.140
<v Speaker 1>but if your attitude is proper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can come back out.</v>

547
00:32:38.141 --> 00:32:41.600
<v Speaker 1>The other side changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a story of redemption.</v>

548
00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

549
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.963
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you are a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in a bad relationship and maybe </v>

550
00:32:49.911 --> 00:32:50.744
<v Speaker 1>you weren't that happy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know it was better than no </v>

551
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:52.994
<v Speaker 1>relationship at all and then the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are in a relationship betrayed </v>

552
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:56.983
<v Speaker 1>you and maybe they did that because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually weren't that happy with the </v>

553
00:32:58.791 --> 00:32:59.624
<v Speaker 1>relationship anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they did that because you're a </v>

554
00:33:01.071 --> 00:33:01.904
<v Speaker 1>little bit naive or maybe they did that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you were a little bit too easy </v>

555
00:33:04.041 --> 00:33:06.950
<v Speaker 1>to get along with and as a consequent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit on the boring side.</v>

556
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:08.863
<v Speaker 1>And so when they first leave you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a catastrophe because your world </v>

557
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 1>falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when your world falls apart,</v>

558
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:17.270
<v Speaker 1>you're somewhere new as possible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn something new in that place.</v>

559
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:18.470
<v Speaker 1>So you might learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

560
00:33:18.471 --> 00:33:19.304
<v Speaker 1>that you should be a little sharper the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next time that you go out with someone </v>

561
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.303
<v Speaker 1>or you should be a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful about picking up on clues that </v>

562
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:26.024
<v Speaker 1>your partner's board with you or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should stop associating with </v>

563
00:33:29.091 --> 00:33:29.924
<v Speaker 1>lying psychopaths and your life would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more positive and stop thinking </v>

564
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:38.990
<v Speaker 1>that you have the capacity to redeem </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody that is not after redemption in</v>

565
00:33:38.991 --> 00:33:41.990
<v Speaker 1>the least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what that means now and then is that</v>

566
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:42.824
<v Speaker 1>when you fall into the belly of a whale </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're swallowed up by something </v>

567
00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:46.724
<v Speaker 1>that lurks underneath that you can come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the other side transformed and </v>

568
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:52.460
<v Speaker 1>that's actually how people learn.</v>

569
00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:53.983
<v Speaker 1>Every time you learn something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn because something you did </v>

570
00:33:56.691 --> 00:33:57.524
<v Speaker 1>didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that exposes you to the part of the </v>

571
00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:02.390
<v Speaker 1>world that you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you're exposed to part of the</v>

572
00:34:02.391 --> 00:34:03.224
<v Speaker 1>world that you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the possibility of rebuilding </v>

573
00:34:06.351 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 1>the structures that you use to interpret</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

574
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.303
<v Speaker 1>That's often why it's more important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that you're wrong than it is to </v>

575
00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:13.664
<v Speaker 1>prove that you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that you're supposed </v>

576
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:16.064
<v Speaker 1>to learn in university is precisely that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be useful to listen to people </v>

577
00:34:20.031 --> 00:34:23.120
<v Speaker 1>that annoy you on the off chance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they know something,</v>

578
00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:26.780
<v Speaker 1>that if they tell you you can use </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of dying.</v>

579
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:29.983
<v Speaker 1>Talking to people who agree with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say is like walking around in a </v>

580
00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:33.734
<v Speaker 1>desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already know everything that they </v>

581
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:36.524
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason you're associating with them </v>

582
00:34:38.001 --> 00:34:41.120
<v Speaker 1>in that situation is so that they never </v>
<v Speaker 1>say anything that challenges you because</v>

583
00:34:41.121 --> 00:34:41.954
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid that if you go outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you understand that you won't be </v>

584
00:34:44.331 --> 00:34:48.140
<v Speaker 1>able to tolerate the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't the case.</v>

585
00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.213
<v Speaker 1>People have an unbelievable capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and overcome things they don't </v>

586
00:34:52.071 --> 00:34:52.904
<v Speaker 1>understand and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's essentially what gives life its </v>

587
00:34:55.851 --> 00:34:56.684
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Buddhists say life is suffering and </v>

588
00:34:59.481 --> 00:35:00.110
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

589
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.360
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why bother with it?</v>

590
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:03.853
<v Speaker 1>And people do ask that question and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask it in ways that result in their own </v>

591
00:35:07.161 --> 00:35:09.860
<v Speaker 1>destruction and worse in the destruction</v>
<v Speaker 1>of others.</v>

592
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.430
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who become particularly cruel,</v>

593
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:14.443
<v Speaker 1>particularly in a genocidal manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are more than willing to dispense with </v>

594
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:18.344
<v Speaker 1>as many human beings as they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly train their sights on because </v>

595
00:35:20.901 --> 00:35:21.734
<v Speaker 1>they're so disgusted by the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human limitation that they'd rather </v>

596
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.383
<v Speaker 1>eradicated and lots of people become </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicidal because they can't bear the </v>

597
00:35:29.091 --> 00:35:34.091
<v Speaker 1>conditions of their own existence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering is real and it's inescapable.</v>

598
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 1>So the question is what you do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You notice in your own life,</v>

599
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:42.090
<v Speaker 1>and you can do this by watching your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

600
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I often ask my clients to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

601
00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:45.414
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch your life for a week and pretend </v>

602
00:35:48.361 --> 00:35:51.900
<v Speaker 1>you don't know who you are because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know who you are at all,</v>

603
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:53.963
<v Speaker 1>what you understand most about yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the arbitrary presuppositions that </v>

604
00:35:57.001 --> 00:35:57.834
<v Speaker 1>you use to him yourself and and you act </v>
<v Speaker 1>as if those presuppositions are true so </v>

605
00:36:02.371 --> 00:36:07.371
<v Speaker 1>that the revelation of the full nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your character won't terrify you.</v>

606
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.520
<v Speaker 1>People hide in their own boxes and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not surprising,</v>

607
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:15.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a good idea because life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>too hard to hide in a box.</v>

608
00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.550
<v Speaker 1>You can't manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

609
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.270
<v Speaker 1>if you watch yourself for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see certain things.</v>

610
00:36:21.271 --> 00:36:24.120
<v Speaker 1>You'll see some of the time that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and annoyed,</v>

611
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.223
<v Speaker 1>and those are times when you're either </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking advantage of yourself or you're </v>

612
00:36:27.001 --> 00:36:28.020
<v Speaker 1>thinking improperly.</v>

613
00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:29.453
<v Speaker 1>Some of the time you'll be bored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case you're either </v>

614
00:36:31.621 --> 00:36:32.454
<v Speaker 1>undisciplined or you're probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing something you don't want to </v>

615
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:35.604
<v Speaker 1>pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of the time you'll actually be </v>

616
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:41.100
<v Speaker 1>engaged in life and the Times that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged in life,</v>

617
00:36:41.101 --> 00:36:43.950
<v Speaker 1>you will notice that your there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

618
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.060
<v Speaker 1>The distinction between subject and </v>
<v Speaker 1>object disappears when you're engaged in</v>

619
00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:52.920
<v Speaker 1>something that you find meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of life as far as I can tell</v>

620
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:56.040
<v Speaker 1>from studying mythology and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying psychology for decades,</v>

621
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.353
<v Speaker 1>is to find a mode of being that so </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful that the fact that life is </v>

622
00:36:59.761 --> 00:37:00.594
<v Speaker 1>suffering is no longer relevant or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's even acceptable and I would </v>

623
00:37:04.411 --> 00:37:06.720
<v Speaker 1>say as well that people know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing that.</v>

624
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.690
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're doing that in part </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're no longer resentful,</v>

625
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.441
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>

626
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I could do this forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

627
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a timelessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>timelessness that's associated with that</v>

628
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:16.374
<v Speaker 1>state of being from a mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that's equivalent to brief </v>

629
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.780
<v Speaker 1>habitation of the Kingdom of God.</v>

630
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.243
<v Speaker 1>That's the place where you are that's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful that it enables you to bear </v>

631
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.130
<v Speaker 1>the harsh conditions of life without </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming resentful,</v>

632
00:37:29.131 --> 00:37:30.300
<v Speaker 1>bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or cruel,</v>

633
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:34.620
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing that you can pursue </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life that will be half as useful</v>

634
00:37:34.621 --> 00:37:35.454
<v Speaker 1>as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your nervous system being an evolved </v>

635
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:39.654
<v Speaker 1>structure is evolved for a universe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is composed of the interaction between </v>

636
00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:46.110
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the most fundamental constants</v>

637
00:37:46.111 --> 00:37:46.944
<v Speaker 1>that we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They transcend the mirror perception of </v>

638
00:37:49.441 --> 00:37:52.410
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you go is chaos and order.</v>

639
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.353
<v Speaker 1>Traditional Chinese doctors go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's houses to diagnose why it is </v>

640
00:37:57.811 --> 00:37:58.644
<v Speaker 1>that someone in that house is suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they walk in and they think he was </v>

641
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:02.574
<v Speaker 1>too much order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>

642
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:04.163
<v Speaker 1>I've been in houses like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a house where all the furniture </v>

643
00:38:07.161 --> 00:38:07.994
<v Speaker 1>is covered with plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a house where if you put a glass </v>

644
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:13.650
<v Speaker 1>on a wooden table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mistress of the house runs over with</v>

645
00:38:13.651 --> 00:38:16.170
<v Speaker 1>the coaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slips it under immediately and gives you</v>

646
00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:17.004
<v Speaker 1>a dirty look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a place where the children never </v>

647
00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:19.914
<v Speaker 1>play in the living room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a place where the lines in the </v>

648
00:38:23.341 --> 00:38:27.810
<v Speaker 1>carpet or vacuumed so precisely that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually parallel.</v>

649
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.393
<v Speaker 1>That's a place where there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>order that no one can survive because </v>

650
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:32.844
<v Speaker 1>the person who runs the house is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrant and then anyone who's in that </v>

651
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 1>house is sick</v>

652
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:36.963
<v Speaker 1>because they're suffering from an excess</v>
<v Speaker 1>of order and then you can walk into a </v>

653
00:38:39.761 --> 00:38:40.594
<v Speaker 1>house that's completely different and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can even see this in your own room </v>

654
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:45.880
<v Speaker 1>if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's in complete disarray.</v>

655
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.073
<v Speaker 1>You can't even look at that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sick the moment you cross the </v>

656
00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:50.734
<v Speaker 1>threshold because everywhere you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's parts of untransformed chaos </v>

657
00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 1>yelling to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do something about this loser.</v>

658
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:05.563
<v Speaker 1>If you walk into your study and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stack of papers in the midst of which </v>

659
00:39:11.461 --> 00:39:15.350
<v Speaker 1>is buried your homework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice that you have a very tough</v>

660
00:39:15.351 --> 00:39:20.330
<v Speaker 1>time looking at that stack of papers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that is that the stack of</v>

661
00:39:20.331 --> 00:39:21.164
<v Speaker 1>papers that you were ignoring that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>aging and causing you more trouble with </v>

662
00:39:24.741 --> 00:39:25.574
<v Speaker 1>each passing day is a portal into order </v>
<v Speaker 1>through which chaos is flowing and if </v>

663
00:39:30.141 --> 00:39:30.974
<v Speaker 1>you ignore that long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaos will flow through that portal </v>

664
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:39.080
<v Speaker 1>and take over your room and then take </v>
<v Speaker 1>over your life and you might think,</v>

665
00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:39.943
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very strange way of looking at </v>

666
00:39:41.361 --> 00:39:46.080
<v Speaker 1>things and I suppose it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just as an experiment to see whether</v>

667
00:39:46.081 --> 00:39:46.914
<v Speaker 1>or not this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try Not paying your taxes for 10 years </v>

668
00:39:49.551 --> 00:39:50.720
<v Speaker 1>and see what happens.</v>

669
00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.740
<v Speaker 1>This is an old representation right </v>
<v Speaker 1>atlas with the world.</v>

670
00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:58.933
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a representation that says that </v>

671
00:40:00.051 --> 00:40:02.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the proper way to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

672
00:40:02.091 --> 00:40:02.924
<v Speaker 1>That the way that you live properly so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can withstand the nature of </v>

673
00:40:05.481 --> 00:40:10.250
<v Speaker 1>your own being is to pick up a load </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's heavy enough so that if you carry</v>

674
00:40:10.251 --> 00:40:12.170
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some self respect.</v>

675
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:13.973
<v Speaker 1>That's a very weird idea because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently the case that people do </v>

676
00:40:16.731 --> 00:40:18.620
<v Speaker 1>everything they can to lighten their </v>
<v Speaker 1>load,</v>

677
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:19.783
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with carrying a light </v>
<v Speaker 1>load is that then you have nothing </v>

678
00:40:21.681 --> 00:40:25.760
<v Speaker 1>that's useful to do and if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing useful to do all you have around</v>

679
00:40:25.761 --> 00:40:27.800
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're extremely fortunate.</v>

680
00:40:27.801 --> 00:40:28.634
<v Speaker 1>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll only be the case for very short </v>

681
00:40:29.601 --> 00:40:30.434
<v Speaker 1>periods of time is meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suffering and there's nothing worse for </v>

682
00:40:34.011 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 1>your sold and meaningless suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look around,</v>

683
00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:38.674
<v Speaker 1>you see the people that you respect and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean that you think about </v>

684
00:40:41.351 --> 00:40:44.470
<v Speaker 1>respecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the ones that you're got,</v>

685
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.313
<v Speaker 1>your whole being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your embodied being tells you to </v>

686
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:47.554
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see that it's always people who </v>

687
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:50.770
<v Speaker 1>picked up something heavy and her </v>
<v Speaker 1>caring.</v>

688
00:40:50.771 --> 00:40:53.620
<v Speaker 1>It's successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think now that's what it means to be</v>

689
00:40:53.621 --> 00:40:56.770
<v Speaker 1>a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you see that you can think,</v>

690
00:40:56.771 --> 00:40:57.604
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps life is worthwhile despite the </v>

691
00:40:59.171 --> 00:41:01.720
<v Speaker 1>fact that the essential nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is suffering.</v>

692
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:07.263
<v Speaker 1>There's an old Jewish idea and the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that man and God are in a sense </v>

693
00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:13.390
<v Speaker 1>twins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange idea,</v>

694
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:15.460
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to hinge on something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

695
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:21.120
<v Speaker 1>the classic attributes of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the attributes of the absolute</v>

696
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.150
<v Speaker 1>omniscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>omnipotence and omnipresence.</v>

697
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Do anything be anything kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>translate the other one momentarily.</v>

698
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:37.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a question goes along with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it being that's characterized by</v>

699
00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:39.500
<v Speaker 1>the absolute attributes of God lack</v>

700
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.273
<v Speaker 1>and the answer that is limitation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an unbelievably interesting idea </v>

701
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.283
<v Speaker 1>and the reason it's so interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that modern </v>

702
00:41:49.831 --> 00:41:50.664
<v Speaker 1>psychology is increasingly telling us is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that without the limitation that a </v>

703
00:41:54.061 --> 00:41:54.894
<v Speaker 1>creature like us with the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our consciousness brings to bear on the </v>

704
00:41:58.381 --> 00:41:59.880
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reality.</v>

705
00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.713
<v Speaker 1>The reality is is an emergent </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the interaction between </v>

706
00:42:04.381 --> 00:42:08.610
<v Speaker 1>something that's painfully limited like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the US and whatever the absolute is,</v>

707
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.040
<v Speaker 1>which is something that is completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>without borders,</v>

708
00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:15.030
<v Speaker 1>and what that implies in a sense is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>without limitation,</v>

709
00:42:15.031 --> 00:42:19.860
<v Speaker 1>there's no being with limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's suffering without suffering.</v>

710
00:42:19.861 --> 00:42:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Then there's no Ba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you might think,</v>

711
00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:25.710
<v Speaker 1>well perhaps there should be no beating </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lots of people act their whole lives</v>

712
00:42:25.711 --> 00:42:26.544
<v Speaker 1>in order to see if they can make that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility and that's really a luxury </v>

713
00:42:28.921 --> 00:42:29.754
<v Speaker 1>we don't have anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the alternative is to presume that </v>

714
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.353
<v Speaker 1>being is worth the suffering and to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mode of being that allows you to make </v>

715
00:42:37.351 --> 00:42:38.184
<v Speaker 1>that claim.</v>

716
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.053
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say in a sense that's your </v>

717
00:42:40.741 --> 00:42:41.574
<v Speaker 1>existential destiny and if you're here </v>
<v Speaker 1>at university rather than a trade </v>

718
00:42:45.001 --> 00:42:45.834
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job is to figure out how to be a </v>

719
00:42:47.881 --> 00:42:52.881
<v Speaker 1>human being and that's a much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important job than any specific time.</v>

720
00:42:54.211 --> 00:42:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Limited concrete permit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic plan,</v>

721
00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.820
<v Speaker 1>you have an unlimited possibility for </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

722
00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:00.773
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals are way more powerful than </v>

723
00:43:02.941 --> 00:43:04.860
<v Speaker 1>they think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more powerful for evil,</v>

724
00:43:04.861 --> 00:43:05.694
<v Speaker 1>but they're also more powerful for good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These archaic stories that I've been </v>

725
00:43:09.451 --> 00:43:12.090
<v Speaker 1>telling you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have something to say to you.</v>

726
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:13.223
<v Speaker 1>They say life is uncertain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll never know enough and normally </v>

727
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.620
<v Speaker 1>that you never can do enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>

728
00:43:19.621 --> 00:43:23.490
<v Speaker 1>everything that you stand on is shaky </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they say,</v>

729
00:43:23.491 --> 00:43:26.400
<v Speaker 1>but you still have to stand on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're standing on it,</v>

730
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.050
<v Speaker 1>you have to improve it</v>

731
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's how life goes on and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you live your life and if you forget</v>

732
00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:34.244
<v Speaker 1>those things or if you undermine them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the same situation that the </v>

733
00:43:37.881 --> 00:43:38.714
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate man was that I told you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in the Old Testament who reached </v>

734
00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:45.110
<v Speaker 1>out to touch something he should've left</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

735
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.023
<v Speaker 1>To the degree that you're human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to abide by a certain set of </v>

736
00:43:51.741 --> 00:43:52.574
<v Speaker 1>truths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truths that I told you about today </v>

737
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.030
<v Speaker 1>are as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's close to a minimal set.</v>

738
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.150
<v Speaker 1>There's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's order.</v>

739
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:03.493
<v Speaker 1>You're stuck with both of them and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>both have a cost and they both have </v>

740
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:10.370
<v Speaker 1>advantages and your job is to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to serve as the appropriate mediator</v>

741
00:44:10.371 --> 00:44:11.204
<v Speaker 1>between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell when you're doing that </v>

742
00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:14.294
<v Speaker 1>because when you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dismal circumstances of your life </v>

743
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.580
<v Speaker 1>manifest them selves to you as eminently</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable,</v>

744
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.073
<v Speaker 1>and it's in that situation that you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've placed yourself in a </v>

745
00:44:27.771 --> 00:44:28.604
<v Speaker 1>position in nature where everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>in harmony and that's the place to aim </v>

746
00:44:32.131 --> 00:44:34.680
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice talking to you.</v>

747
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.473
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I would say is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with someone who's </v>

748
00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:49.873
<v Speaker 1>depressed and they're really depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should try giving them </v>

749
00:44:51.471 --> 00:44:54.710
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants because if they die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't help them.</v>

750
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're suffering,</v>

751
00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:03.220
<v Speaker 1>you are obligated in a sense to hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto whatever roped someone throws you.</v>

752
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.530
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I do with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients all the time,</v>

753
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.390
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're really in trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to tell them,</v>

754
00:45:08.391 --> 00:45:09.224
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what's going to </v>

755
00:45:10.221 --> 00:45:11.180
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Help you,</v>

756
00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:14.930
<v Speaker 1>but don't arbitrarily throw out any </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities because you might not have</v>

757
00:45:14.931 --> 00:45:17.990
<v Speaker 1>that luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antidepressants help a lot of people and</v>

758
00:45:17.991 --> 00:45:20.060
<v Speaker 1>there are technical reasons why that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>

759
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:21.253
<v Speaker 1>So that's a simple answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not relevant to what I already </v>

760
00:45:24.591 --> 00:45:28.640
<v Speaker 1>described except that if you're offered </v>
<v Speaker 1>a gift by your society and it works,</v>

761
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:29.503
<v Speaker 1>try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what your presuppositions </v>

762
00:45:31.251 --> 00:45:34.190
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apart from that,</v>

763
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.093
<v Speaker 1>lots of lots of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of the time you see people who are </v>

764
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.110
<v Speaker 1>suffering with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

765
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:45.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a multitude of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll take one common reason.</v>

766
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:46.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think about it as associated </v>

767
00:45:48.001 --> 00:45:48.834
<v Speaker 1>with the story of Peter Pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Pan is someone who won't grow up </v>

768
00:45:51.811 --> 00:45:54.030
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with Peter Pan is he gets to</v>

769
00:45:54.031 --> 00:45:56.190
<v Speaker 1>be king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's King of Neverland.</v>

770
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.173
<v Speaker 1>Neverland doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So being king of nothing isn't that </v>

771
00:46:00.271 --> 00:46:01.880
<v Speaker 1>helpful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

772
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:02.723
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you often see </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who suffer from depression </v>

773
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:05.341
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

774
00:46:05.341 --> 00:46:06.174
<v Speaker 1>and not making a blanket statement about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cause of depression because there's </v>

775
00:46:08.671 --> 00:46:09.504
<v Speaker 1>lots of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people who don't have enough </v>

776
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 1>order in their life tend to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed.</v>

777
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:14.873
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone comes into me and see to see </v>

778
00:46:17.101 --> 00:46:17.934
<v Speaker 1>me and they say they're depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always asked him a very standard set </v>

779
00:46:20.461 --> 00:46:23.160
<v Speaker 1>of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a job?</v>

780
00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.020
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really in trouble in our society,</v>

781
00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:27.973
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

782
00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:28.813
<v Speaker 1>your biological rhythms tend to go off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rails right away because there's no </v>

783
00:46:30.741 --> 00:46:33.560
<v Speaker 1>reason to go to bed at any particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and there's no reason to get up and</v>

784
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:36.830
<v Speaker 1>for many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't get up at the same time,</v>

785
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.963
<v Speaker 1>they follow up the functioning of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>circadian rhythms and that's enough to </v>

786
00:46:40.371 --> 00:46:41.204
<v Speaker 1>make them depressed right off the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they start napping during </v>

787
00:46:43.071 --> 00:46:45.980
<v Speaker 1>the afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't also don't have a purpose.</v>

788
00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.470
<v Speaker 1>People aren't good without a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't.</v>

789
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:49.543
<v Speaker 1>This isn't hypothesizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We absolutely understand the circuitry </v>

790
00:46:53.091 --> 00:46:56.330
<v Speaker 1>that underlies positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how it works.</v>

791
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.313
<v Speaker 1>Almost all the positive emotion that any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you are likely to experience in your </v>

792
00:46:59.571 --> 00:47:02.300
<v Speaker 1>life will not be a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attaining things.</v>

793
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:03.523
<v Speaker 1>It will be a consequence of seeing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are working as you proceed </v>

794
00:47:06.771 --> 00:47:07.910
<v Speaker 1>towards a goal you value.</v>

795
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:09.223
<v Speaker 1>That's completely different and you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know this because people are often </v>

796
00:47:11.481 --> 00:47:12.560
<v Speaker 1>stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

797
00:47:12.561 --> 00:47:13.394
<v Speaker 1>they finished their phd thesis and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition is that they're going to </v>

798
00:47:16.221 --> 00:47:17.054
<v Speaker 1>be elated for a month and often instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually depressed and they </v>

799
00:47:19.971 --> 00:47:20.804
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

800
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:21.703
<v Speaker 1>hell I'd been working on this for seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and I handed it in and what do I </v>

801
00:47:24.921 --> 00:47:26.930
<v Speaker 1>do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what depresses them,</v>

802
00:47:26.931 --> 00:47:27.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

803
00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:28.640
<v Speaker 1>what do I do now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

804
00:47:28.641 --> 00:47:31.300
<v Speaker 1>they're fine if they enjoyed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing the thing,</v>

805
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:32.223
<v Speaker 1>as long as it was working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a lot of enthusiasm and </v>

806
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:36.190
<v Speaker 1>excitement out of that because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how our nervous systems work.</v>

807
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Most of your positive emotion is goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit,</v>

808
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:40.083
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take drugs like cocaine or </v>

809
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:42.544
<v Speaker 1>amphetamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason they're enjoyable is because </v>

810
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:46.420
<v Speaker 1>they turn on the systems that help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue goals.</v>

811
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:47.560
<v Speaker 1>That's why people like them.</v>

812
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.230
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got no structure,</v>

813
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.230
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you tend not to have a point.</v>

814
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:54.693
<v Speaker 1>So you're overwhelmed by chaotic lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and you don't have any </v>

815
00:47:57.101 --> 00:47:58.180
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

816
00:47:58.181 --> 00:47:59.014
<v Speaker 1>do you have any friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes you see people who are </v>

817
00:48:01.001 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no job,</v>

818
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.660
<v Speaker 1>they have no friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no intimate relationship,</v>

819
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:05.703
<v Speaker 1>they have an additional health problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a drug and alcohol </v>

820
00:48:07.961 --> 00:48:10.000
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My experience has been,</v>

821
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:14.470
<v Speaker 1>if you have three of those problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to help you.</v>

822
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:15.843
<v Speaker 1>You're so deeply mired in chaos that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't get out because you make progress </v>

823
00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Speaker 1>on one front and one of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems pulls you down.</v>

824
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.730
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I tell people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are depressed is like,</v>

825
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:28.990
<v Speaker 1>don't sacrifice your stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a job.</v>

826
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's not the job you exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

827
00:48:31.061 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 1>get a damn job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a job.</v>

828
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Find some friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out in the dating circuit,</v>

829
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.650
<v Speaker 1>see if you can establish an intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

830
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:39.663
<v Speaker 1>Put together some of the foundation </v>
<v Speaker 1>litems that that are like pillars that </v>

831
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:45.400
<v Speaker 1>you're life rests on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the practical thing to do.</v>

832
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:48.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's one example with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

833
00:48:54.090 --> 00:48:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing is you don't just launch </v>
<v Speaker 1>it on them.</v>

834
00:48:56.171 --> 00:48:58.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to negotiate with the person and</v>

835
00:48:58.961 --> 00:49:01.240
<v Speaker 1>you also got to teach them to negotiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with themselves.</v>

836
00:49:01.241 --> 00:49:03.220
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that's very useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know,</v>

837
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tear an eis yourself into doing </v>

838
00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:07.810
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't recommend it.</v>

839
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:08.673
<v Speaker 1>What I would recommend that instead is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you ask yourself what you're </v>

840
00:49:10.811 --> 00:49:13.030
<v Speaker 1>willing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really effective technique.</v>

841
00:49:13.031 --> 00:49:15.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like a meditative techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

842
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.870
<v Speaker 1>you can get up in the morning and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take,</v>

843
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:17.831
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

844
00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:20.530
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have a good day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like to go to bed tonight without</v>

845
00:49:20.531 --> 00:49:23.980
<v Speaker 1>feeling guilty because I didn't do some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things I said I was going to do and I,</v>

846
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:24.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have kind of an interesting </v>

847
00:49:25.541 --> 00:49:26.374
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to fulfill my </v>

848
00:49:26.951 --> 00:49:29.170
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities and I want to enjoy the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

849
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Then you can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

850
00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:31.933
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would I have to do in order for </v>

851
00:49:33.491 --> 00:49:35.200
<v Speaker 1>that to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I would do?</v>

852
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.620
<v Speaker 1>And the probability if you practice this</v>
<v Speaker 1>for three or four days,</v>

853
00:49:38.621 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 1>is your brain will just tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>

854
00:49:39.821 --> 00:49:40.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

855
00:49:40.241 --> 00:49:42.760
<v Speaker 1>there's that piece of homework that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't done for like three weeks.</v>

856
00:49:42.761 --> 00:49:43.594
<v Speaker 1>You should knock that sucker off because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will only take you 10 minutes and </v>

857
00:49:45.221 --> 00:49:49.540
<v Speaker 1>you've been avoiding it and torturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to death for 72 hours straight,</v>

858
00:49:49.541 --> 00:49:50.374
<v Speaker 1>and if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a little interesting thing you </v>

859
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:52.624
<v Speaker 1>can do and you know maybe this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little obligations you should clean up </v>

860
00:49:55.031 --> 00:49:55.864
<v Speaker 1>and so what you do in a situation like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as you teach the person to </v>

861
00:49:59.951 --> 00:50:01.630
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with themselves say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

862
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:04.030
<v Speaker 1>let's figure out what your aims are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta have some names,</v>

863
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:05.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they might say,</v>

864
00:50:05.831 --> 00:50:07.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so depressed I don't have any aims.</v>

865
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:08.261
<v Speaker 1>And then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

866
00:50:08.261 --> 00:50:09.094
<v Speaker 1>pick the least objectionable of the Ames</v>
<v Speaker 1>and act it out for awhile and see what </v>

867
00:50:12.221 --> 00:50:13.870
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes your emotional,</v>

868
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.303
<v Speaker 1>your emotional systems are so followed </v>
<v Speaker 1>up that you have to pretend you have to </v>

869
00:50:18.851 --> 00:50:21.100
<v Speaker 1>act the thing out before you can start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to believe it.</v>

870
00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.113
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always assume they have to </v>

871
00:50:22.691 --> 00:50:23.910
<v Speaker 1>believe in then act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

872
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.230
<v Speaker 1>But that's sometimes that's true in lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times.</v>

873
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the trick,</v>

874
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.873
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing therapeutic work with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and you're helping them </v>

875
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:32.690
<v Speaker 1>establish a structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to find out what they'll do.</v>

876
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they want to get better,</v>

877
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:40.310
<v Speaker 1>which is not a given because there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>often payoffs for not getting better.</v>

878
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:41.653
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the payoffs of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>martyr or maybe the payoffs of doing </v>

879
00:50:44.211 --> 00:50:45.044
<v Speaker 1>what you're entirely pathological family</v>
<v Speaker 1>members want you to do because they </v>

880
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:48.980
<v Speaker 1>actually want you to fail.</v>

881
00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Assuming you want to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's usually something you can figure</v>

882
00:50:53.031 --> 00:50:56.570
<v Speaker 1>out that would constitute a step towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of concrete goal.</v>

883
00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:57.853
<v Speaker 1>And my presumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a behavioral presumptions </v>

884
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:04.870
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally is that small accruing </v>
<v Speaker 1>gains that repeat unbelievably powerful.</v>

885
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So this is another thing to know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your own life.</v>

886
00:51:10.101 --> 00:51:10.934
<v Speaker 1>It's something I learned in part from </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading the writings of Alexander </v>

887
00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:13.943
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a great Russian philosopher and </v>

888
00:51:15.141 --> 00:51:16.760
<v Speaker 1>novelist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

889
00:51:16.761 --> 00:51:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you can look at your life and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what isn't right about it.</v>

890
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 1>We know you have to do is look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can start to fix that.</v>

891
00:51:24.231 --> 00:51:29.120
<v Speaker 1>And the way you fix it is by noticing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you could in fact fix.</v>

892
00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.513
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are often trying to fix things </v>

893
00:51:31.341 --> 00:51:32.174
<v Speaker 1>they can fix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would not recommend because if </v>

894
00:51:33.561 --> 00:51:35.870
<v Speaker 1>you try to fix something you can't text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll just ruin it.</v>

895
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Like you can find all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates who are perfectly willing</v>

896
00:51:38.961 --> 00:51:40.640
<v Speaker 1>to restructure the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

897
00:51:40.641 --> 00:51:41.474
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the international economic system who </v>

898
00:51:43.341 --> 00:51:46.940
<v Speaker 1>cannot keep the room clean and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a gap there,</v>

899
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.073
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's surprising that people don't </v>

900
00:51:48.951 --> 00:51:51.860
<v Speaker 1>actually notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say if you pay attention,</v>

901
00:51:51.861 --> 00:51:54.620
<v Speaker 1>you can see things that you could fix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They yell at you,</v>

902
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 1>they really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even know how that happens.</v>

903
00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an example because rooms</v>

904
00:52:00.111 --> 00:52:04.040
<v Speaker 1>are full of stories and the stories have</v>
<v Speaker 1>have effects on you.</v>

905
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:04.874
<v Speaker 1>So here's a classic experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take two groups of </v>

906
00:52:07.461 --> 00:52:08.294
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring them into your lab and you </v>

907
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:13.730
<v Speaker 1>give one group a multiple choice test </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a bunch of words in it that are</v>

908
00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:17.510
<v Speaker 1>associated with being old and you give </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other group the same multiple choice</v>

909
00:52:17.511 --> 00:52:19.640
<v Speaker 1>test except the words are associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with being young.</v>

910
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 1>This is independent of the content of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the test.</v>

911
00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just descriptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you time the undergraduate says</v>

912
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:28.610
<v Speaker 1>they walked back to the elevators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones who read,</v>

913
00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:29.653
<v Speaker 1>the ones who completed the multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice tests that had more words </v>

914
00:52:31.371 --> 00:52:32.204
<v Speaker 1>associated with aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk slower back to the elevators and </v>

915
00:52:34.491 --> 00:52:35.324
<v Speaker 1>they don't know that and they don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it and that that study's </v>

916
00:52:38.181 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 1>been replicated in various forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>

917
00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:41.024
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're unbelievably sensitive to the </v>

918
00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:45.590
<v Speaker 1>story that your environment is telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because your environment is not made</v>

919
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:47.570
<v Speaker 1>out of objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just wrong.</v>

920
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Your environment is basically made out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of something like tools,</v>

921
00:52:50.211 --> 00:52:52.340
<v Speaker 1>that obstacles you're a tool using </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature,</v>

922
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 1>you a tool perceiving creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you like.</v>

923
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:56.390
<v Speaker 1>If I take you out of this room and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

924
00:52:56.391 --> 00:52:57.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was in the room?</v>

925
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:58.650
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

926
00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>random patterns in the carpet because </v>

927
00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.640
<v Speaker 1>they're real or just as good an object </v>
<v Speaker 1>as anything else.</v>

928
00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.510
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say chairs because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can sit on them and you're gonna.</v>

929
00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:08.363
<v Speaker 1>Say handrails because you can hold them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say stairs because you can walk </v>

930
00:53:10.641 --> 00:53:12.470
<v Speaker 1>down them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you see.</v>

931
00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:13.453
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you pay attention to your </v>

932
00:53:14.721 --> 00:53:16.160
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you,</v>

933
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:18.800
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extended all of your experiences,</v>

934
00:53:18.801 --> 00:53:20.330
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will tell you all the time,</v>

935
00:53:20.331 --> 00:53:22.100
<v Speaker 1>what you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is do it.</v>

936
00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:24.260
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to decide if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

937
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've noticed about </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

938
00:53:26.701 --> 00:53:27.534
<v Speaker 1>because I've wondered once I started </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying these mythological stories and </v>

939
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:30.534
<v Speaker 1>I got this idea about the fact that life</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be meaningful enough to justify its </v>

940
00:53:36.081 --> 00:53:36.901
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

941
00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such a good idea because it's not</v>

942
00:53:39.181 --> 00:53:40.380
<v Speaker 1>optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

943
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:41.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people will tell you what,</v>

944
00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:42.420
<v Speaker 1>you can be happy.</v>

945
00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like those people are idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

946
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:45.774
<v Speaker 1>they're idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be things that come </v>

947
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:47.604
<v Speaker 1>along that flat new so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't believe it and you're not </v>

948
00:53:50.491 --> 00:53:51.324
<v Speaker 1>happy then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if life is to be happy while in </v>

949
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:54.480
<v Speaker 1>those situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

950
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Why are you even live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let isn't.</v>

951
00:53:56.971 --> 00:53:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Life isn't to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're happy,</v>

952
00:53:58.921 --> 00:54:00.870
<v Speaker 1>you're bloody fortunate and you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it.</v>

953
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.820
<v Speaker 1>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the grace of God,</v>

954
00:54:02.821 --> 00:54:06.090
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to meaning,</v>

955
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:07.793
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

956
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:09.960
<v Speaker 1>people know when they're doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>

957
00:54:09.961 --> 00:54:12.060
<v Speaker 1>they can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why the hell don't they do meaningful</v>

958
00:54:12.061 --> 00:54:15.030
<v Speaker 1>things all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems obvious you could do it.</v>

959
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

960
00:54:16.671 --> 00:54:19.290
<v Speaker 1>because other people want you to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things and it's a struggle,</v>

961
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:21.720
<v Speaker 1>but everything's a struggle and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

962
00:54:21.721 --> 00:54:22.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

963
00:54:22.741 --> 00:54:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

964
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I see why it took me about 10 years to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure this out.</v>

965
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.050
<v Speaker 1>People have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choice number one,</v>

966
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:30.660
<v Speaker 1>nothing you do means anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

967
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:31.890
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a drag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

968
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Meaninglessness of life and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential angst,</v>

969
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a pain,</v>

970
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:37.463
<v Speaker 1>but the upside of nothing that you do be</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean is meaningful is you don't have to </v>

971
00:54:41.731 --> 00:54:43.950
<v Speaker 1>do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got no responsibility.</v>

972
00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:44.813
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to suffer because things are </v>

973
00:54:45.481 --> 00:54:46.314
<v Speaker 1>meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a small price to pay for </v>

974
00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:51.450
<v Speaker 1>being able to be completely useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alternative,</v>

975
00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:54.450
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is everything you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

976
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you make a mistake,</v>

977
00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a real mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you be someone,</v>

978
00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:03.540
<v Speaker 1>you tilt the world a little more sharply</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards evil rather than good,</v>

979
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.420
<v Speaker 1>it matters what you do well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you buy that,</v>

980
00:55:06.421 --> 00:55:09.900
<v Speaker 1>then you can have a meaningful life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no mucking around.</v>

981
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.950
<v Speaker 1>It means responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that the decisions you make are</v>

982
00:55:13.951 --> 00:55:14.784
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that when you do something </v>

983
00:55:16.441 --> 00:55:18.210
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>

984
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want that?</v>

985
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.073
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very hard question because </v>

986
00:55:25.891 --> 00:55:28.980
<v Speaker 1>people don't always mean the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they say their own moral compass.</v>

987
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at here,</v>

988
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.983
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's.</v>

989
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I mean by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically part of the way,</v>

990
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.153
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you're able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguish between right and wrong is </v>

991
00:55:36.901 --> 00:55:37.734
<v Speaker 1>because you are a certain kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological organism and then another </v>

992
00:55:40.621 --> 00:55:43.530
<v Speaker 1>reason is that your head is full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

993
00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the people you've met,</v>

994
00:55:45.631 --> 00:55:46.464
<v Speaker 1>all the people that you've interacted </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their own telling you a way to </v>

995
00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:53.010
<v Speaker 1>behave that's good in a way that isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are circumstances under which your</v>

996
00:55:53.011 --> 00:55:55.830
<v Speaker 1>conscience should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the or the duty you have to.</v>

997
00:55:55.831 --> 00:55:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Your conscience should override the duty</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to social norms,</v>

998
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:00.383
<v Speaker 1>but before you break a rule because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're going to be doing a good </v>

999
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:06.174
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bloody well better make sure you </v>

1000
00:56:07.621 --> 00:56:08.454
<v Speaker 1>have your head screwed on straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>because every time you tell yourself a </v>

1001
00:56:10.921 --> 00:56:13.050
<v Speaker 1>lie and every time you act out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>falsehood,</v>

1002
00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:14.363
<v Speaker 1>you disturbed the pristine integrity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your nervous system and the reports </v>

1003
00:56:19.441 --> 00:56:22.380
<v Speaker 1>it'll give you about the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world will be distorted as a consequence</v>

1004
00:56:22.381 --> 00:56:23.214
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

1005
00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:24.203
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a moral obligation to follow </v>

1006
00:56:25.531 --> 00:56:26.364
<v Speaker 1>the dictates of your conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have a moral obligation to </v>

1007
00:56:29.161 --> 00:56:29.994
<v Speaker 1>make sure that your life is straightened</v>
<v Speaker 1>out so that you can rely on your own </v>

1008
00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:34.260
<v Speaker 1>judgment and you can't separate those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
