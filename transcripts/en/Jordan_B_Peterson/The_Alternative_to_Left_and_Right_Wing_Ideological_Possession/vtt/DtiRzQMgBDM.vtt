1
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.753
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.883
<v Speaker 2>so people are possessed by a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of our nature to be possessed </v>

3
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:15.504
<v Speaker 2>by this question and so you can think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this as an architectural question </v>

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.673
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the question is what are we doing </v>

5
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:25.284
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can ask yourself that in </v>

6
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:32.781
<v Speaker 2>relationship to this conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're here to search for meaning and to</v>

7
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 2>understand what that might mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also might ask yourself,</v>

8
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:37.434
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it that you have to be here for </v>

9
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:42.374
<v Speaker 2>your search for meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that something that drives human </v>

10
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 2>beings?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't characteristic.</v>

11
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:47.450
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of animals,</v>

12
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 2>they don't seem to question their </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence,</v>

13
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 2>so there's something about the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature of human being that makes us feel</v>

14
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 2>as if something needs to be set right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that's been discussed historically,</v>

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 2>it's been associated with the term </v>
<v Speaker 2>redemption.</v>

16
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 2>People are in need of redemption in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern age.</v>

17
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:15.400
<v Speaker 2>We talk about positive psychology and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about happiness,</v>

18
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:16.234
<v Speaker 2>which is a much weaker word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our forefathers had a more profound </v>

19
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.214
<v Speaker 2>sense of the problematic state of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence and they use more profound </v>

20
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:33.380
<v Speaker 2>words and the idea that we have a need </v>
<v Speaker 2>for redemption is a more profound idea.</v>

21
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to talk mostly about human</v>

22
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 2>beings in the West because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature that I'm most familiar with.</v>

23
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Human beings in the West have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditating on the nature of human beings</v>

24
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 2>for thousands of years perhaps ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>since we became self conscious,</v>

25
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.533
<v Speaker 2>which is another thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguishes us from animals and </v>

26
00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 2>another thing that drives our search for</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

27
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.693
<v Speaker 2>The consequence of this meditation or </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the consequences of this </v>

28
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:07.414
<v Speaker 2>meditation has been the production of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>series of books that people know is the </v>

29
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:15.931
<v Speaker 2>Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized years ago that people saw the</v>

30
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:18.644
<v Speaker 2>world through lenses of belief and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently it's been demonstrated that </v>

31
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 2>that's actually inevitable because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a limited cognitive processor.</v>

32
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.240
<v Speaker 2>You have to frame your perceptions with </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs.</v>

33
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.113
<v Speaker 2>What I learned is that the belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems that people use to frame their </v>

34
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 2>perceptions have a structure and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure is religious,</v>

35
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 2>so religious presupposition is one that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you you might even know not noticed that</v>

36
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.034
<v Speaker 2>you make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's it's a predicate or an axiom or an </v>

37
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:52.524
<v Speaker 2>assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the study of those axiomatic </v>

38
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:59.931
<v Speaker 2>assumptions is what religion is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of your axiomatic assumptions,</v>

39
00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:03.474
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that life involves a search for </v>

40
00:03:06.981 --> 00:03:11.720
<v Speaker 2>meaning and that's associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of redemption and you.</v>

41
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.900
<v Speaker 2>You'll notice that you asked that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question because of course you're here,</v>

42
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.693
<v Speaker 2>but you might not notice how strange it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that all of you asked that question </v>

43
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.293
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that all of you asked that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question that human beings have asked </v>

44
00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:26.570
<v Speaker 2>that question for as far back as we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

45
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.360
<v Speaker 2>is indicative of something profound </v>
<v Speaker 2>about human nature.</v>

46
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.520
<v Speaker 2>It's lack of completion.</v>

47
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.443
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to walk you through the series</v>
<v Speaker 2>of stories that make up this library of </v>

48
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>books known as the Bible because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>presents a theory of redemption.</v>

49
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.243
<v Speaker 2>That in a sense is emergent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a consequence of this insanely </v>

50
00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:53.234
<v Speaker 2>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cross-generational meditation on the </v>

51
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:02.581
<v Speaker 2>nature of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not designed by any one person.</v>

52
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.973
<v Speaker 2>It's designed by processes that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really understand because we don't know </v>

53
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.443
<v Speaker 2>anything about how books are written </v>
<v Speaker 2>over thousands of years or what forces </v>

54
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:14.344
<v Speaker 2>caused them to be compiled into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way or what narrative direction </v>

55
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 2>they tend to take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

56
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's strange about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible,</v>

57
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:21.424
<v Speaker 2>given that it's a collection of books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it actually has a narrative </v>

58
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:24.094
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a story and that story's been </v>

59
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.530
<v Speaker 2>cobbled together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

60
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's emerged out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>depths.</v>

61
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not a top down story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a bottom up story.</v>

62
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Then I suppose that's why many of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world's major religions regard the Bible</v>

63
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 2>as a book that was revealed rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>one that was written.</v>

64
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.043
<v Speaker 2>It's a perfectly reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>presupposition that it's revealed </v>

65
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 2>because it's not the consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>work of anyone author.</v>

66
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not written according to a plan or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a plan that we can understand,</v>

67
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.793
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless it has a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also has a strange structure in that </v>

68
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 2>it's full of stories that no one can </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgive,</v>

69
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:02.974
<v Speaker 2>but that also that no one can understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the combination of incomprehensible </v>

70
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:08.134
<v Speaker 2>and unforgettable is a very strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination and of course that </v>

71
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 2>combination is basically mythological,</v>

72
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.753
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to start out by telling you</v>
<v Speaker 2>what genesis has to say about why it is </v>

73
00:05:20.901 --> 00:05:22.430
<v Speaker 2>that you need to search for meaning.</v>

74
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.753
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are pretty familiar as a general </v>

75
00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:28.154
<v Speaker 2>rule with the basic stories in genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genesis starts out with the word of God </v>

76
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:37.991
<v Speaker 2>creating being from chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very complicated idea.</v>

77
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.160
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that whatever the word is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is logos from a,</v>

78
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.250
<v Speaker 2>from a Christian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a Western perspective,</v>

79
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:47.084
<v Speaker 2>that logos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something like consciousness </v>

80
00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:49.304
<v Speaker 2>and something like speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the power to pull order out of an </v>

81
00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:55.250
<v Speaker 2>underlying chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we do this all the time.</v>

82
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.690
<v Speaker 2>People do this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's I suppose in some sense,</v>

83
00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.420
<v Speaker 2>white were hypothetically made in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>image of God.</v>

84
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.063
<v Speaker 2>We use our consciousness to constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>construct being out of chaos and </v>

85
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.700
<v Speaker 2>according to the initial opening of </v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis.</v>

86
00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.700
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that that's akin</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the construction of the world,</v>

87
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.410
<v Speaker 2>and so that means that from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of this book,</v>

88
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.040
<v Speaker 2>consciousness itself plays a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>constructing role.</v>

89
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.730
<v Speaker 2>It's got a central place and human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings in some sense,</v>

90
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.510
<v Speaker 2>parties participate in that in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>minor sense I suppose,</v>

91
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.333
<v Speaker 2>but in a sense that not nonetheless </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them akin to what the library </v>

92
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 2>books called the Bible assumes his daddy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one squad</v>

93
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.573
<v Speaker 2>logos extracts order out of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He builds a little world and it </v>

94
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:48.184
<v Speaker 2>populates it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then in the little world he puts a </v>

95
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:51.850
<v Speaker 2>garden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a walled garden,</v>

96
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.053
<v Speaker 2>Paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's paradise means walled garden or </v>

97
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.383
<v Speaker 2>Eden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eden means well watered place and you </v>

98
00:06:57.731 --> 00:06:58.564
<v Speaker 2>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

99
00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.643
<v Speaker 2>why had garden?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is a garden is </v>

100
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:02.584
<v Speaker 2>the optimal combination of nature and </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture or chaos and order because the </v>

101
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 2>garden is where nature flourishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also where nature flourishes in</v>

102
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a safe and controlled environment.</v>

103
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:15.404
<v Speaker 2>And so that's like an optimal </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment for people and so there's a </v>

104
00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:18.844
<v Speaker 2>garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God puts the people in there and that's </v>

105
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:23.950
<v Speaker 2>optimal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he warns them,</v>

106
00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:25.600
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a strange thing.</v>

107
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:26.171
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

108
00:07:26.171 --> 00:07:30.540
<v Speaker 2>now you're in the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you should live and there's</v>

109
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.550
<v Speaker 2>something you shouldn't do and what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do is eat a particular fruit.</v>

110
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to tell you something </v>
<v Speaker 2>about vision.</v>

111
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Human beings have excellent vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

112
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:50.050
<v Speaker 2>we see color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardly any creature see color,</v>

113
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:55.051
<v Speaker 2>but we do and not only do we see color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our vision is tremendously acute.</v>

114
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.790
<v Speaker 2>The only other animals that can see as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well as us or birds of prey for mammals,</v>

115
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.050
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see like you wouldn't believe and</v>

116
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.133
<v Speaker 2>and for primates as well as we can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>much better than our closest primate </v>

117
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.220
<v Speaker 2>relatives and why that is is a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery,</v>

118
00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:13.054
<v Speaker 2>but there's a woman in California who </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems perhaps to absolve that her name </v>

119
00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:17.464
<v Speaker 2>is Lynne Isbell and she was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in how human beings develop </v>

120
00:08:20.321 --> 00:08:21.154
<v Speaker 2>vision and she's interested in patterns </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Predation Predator prey </v>

121
00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:27.064
<v Speaker 2>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she knew that our treed dwelling </v>

122
00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:35.680
<v Speaker 2>ancestors millions of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were frequently preyed upon by snakes.</v>

123
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.683
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some evidence that are tree </v>

124
00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:42.220
<v Speaker 2>dwelling ancestors and snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coal evolved,</v>

125
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.653
<v Speaker 2>and that our visual system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly good at picking up the </v>

126
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:50.920
<v Speaker 2>patterns of camouflage that snakes used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hide in trees or in the undergrowth,</v>

127
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 2>and what Isabelle showed was that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at primate populations around the</v>

128
00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:02.020
<v Speaker 2>world where there were more predatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes,</v>

129
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.890
<v Speaker 2>the primates could see better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very high correlation,</v>

130
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:07.803
<v Speaker 2>and so she concluded that the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>that human beings can see so well is </v>

131
00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:11.860
<v Speaker 2>because of snakes.</v>

132
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.843
<v Speaker 2>Now she thought the association between </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and the snake story in genesis was </v>

133
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 2>interestingly coincidental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's much more than that.</v>

134
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know how the Adam and Eve story</v>

135
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 2>came about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know it's very ancient,</v>

136
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sticks in our memory and in our culture,</v>

137
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:35.690
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that seems to be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some strange way,</v>

138
00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 2>it's an extraordinarily accurate </v>
<v Speaker 2>summation.</v>

139
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Snakes gave us vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about fruit?</v>

140
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.283
<v Speaker 2>Lot of the reason we can see colors is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because our visual system evolved to </v>

141
00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:53.500
<v Speaker 2>detect ripe fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about women?</v>

142
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be pretty waked out a woman,</v>

143
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.850
<v Speaker 2>so there's this weird interconnection in</v>
<v Speaker 2>genesis between women,</v>

144
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.853
<v Speaker 2>fruit and snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea is that the interplay </v>

145
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:11.174
<v Speaker 2>between the three you remember women are</v>
<v Speaker 2>gatherers to or were gatherers </v>

146
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.970
<v Speaker 2>historically speaking and they shared </v>
<v Speaker 2>food with men and that's a strange thing</v>

147
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.910
<v Speaker 2>because human beings share food and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardly any other animals do and so women</v>

148
00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:23.744
<v Speaker 2>didn't tempt men with fruit and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't make them self conscious along </v>

149
00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:31.880
<v Speaker 2>with the snake and the fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was a catastrophe.</v>

150
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.650
<v Speaker 2>What happens in genesis is that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>people become self conscious,</v>

151
00:10:36.651 --> 00:10:39.590
<v Speaker 2>when they eat the fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their vision improves.</v>

152
00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:40.424
<v Speaker 2>The scales fall from their eyes and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden they can see in a way that </v>

153
00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:43.274
<v Speaker 2>no other animal has ever seen and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things they can see is that they're </v>

154
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.050
<v Speaker 2>naked and that's a big problem.</v>

155
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.731
<v Speaker 2>And you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

156
00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:54.070
<v Speaker 2>what does being naked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning?</v>

157
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.760
<v Speaker 2>That's quite straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People often dream,</v>

158
00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:57.594
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being naked in front of a crowd and </v>

159
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.823
<v Speaker 2>to be naked in front of a crowd is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all your frailties and </v>

160
00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:07.631
<v Speaker 2>vulnerabilities revealed to judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a nightmare for people and so</v>

161
00:11:09.531 --> 00:11:14.531
<v Speaker 2>to become self aware is to wake up into </v>
<v Speaker 2>a nightmare and the nightmare involves a</v>

162
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.073
<v Speaker 2>profound realization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no individual vulnerability and the </v>

163
00:11:22.971 --> 00:11:23.804
<v Speaker 2>consequence of that in genesis is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are banished from paradise and </v>

164
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.923
<v Speaker 2>are from then on in need of redemption </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they have to work and that's </v>

165
00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:39.890
<v Speaker 2>how man comes to be in a fallen state </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't have a need for redemption</v>

166
00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:40.724
<v Speaker 2>or need for meaning or request after </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning unless you're in a fallen state </v>

167
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.483
<v Speaker 2>and everyone is strangely enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has this intuition that they're in a </v>

168
00:11:48.921 --> 00:11:49.754
<v Speaker 2>fallen state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that something is wrong with the world </v>

169
00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 2>that needs to be put right and and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>that or something is wrong with being.</v>

170
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be put right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And more than that,</v>

171
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.590
<v Speaker 2>that in some weird sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird way.</v>

172
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:00.424
<v Speaker 2>They have a moral obligation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>participate in that process and that </v>

173
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 2>drives us like it's beneath what drives </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

174
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.583
<v Speaker 2>It's an axiomatic presupposition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next thing that happens in genesis </v>

175
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:14.014
<v Speaker 2>is that Abel and Cain are born and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really the first two human </v>

176
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 2>beings because</v>

177
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Adam and eve are made by God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Cain and Abel are born there,</v>

178
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 2>they're the first people that are born </v>
<v Speaker 2>in history</v>

179
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.833
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

180
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.990
<v Speaker 2>interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens between Cain and Abel,</v>

181
00:12:32.991 --> 00:12:36.740
<v Speaker 2>which is jealous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment against God,</v>

182
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:37.603
<v Speaker 2>followed by murder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the first pattern of behavior that </v>

183
00:12:40.761 --> 00:12:43.400
<v Speaker 2>human beings manifest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once they become self conscious.</v>

184
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:44.743
<v Speaker 2>That's an awful story and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prototypical story in a sense because </v>

185
00:12:48.111 --> 00:12:48.944
<v Speaker 2>what it says is that there are two </v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns of reaction to tragic </v>

186
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.370
<v Speaker 2>selfconsciousness and one is associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a murderer,</v>

187
00:12:55.371 --> 00:12:58.490
<v Speaker 2>a state of resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment towards life.</v>

188
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.630
<v Speaker 2>The kind of murderous resentment that </v>
<v Speaker 2>drove the killer in Colorado,</v>

189
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:03.523
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murderous resentment against life and </v>

190
00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:07.334
<v Speaker 2>the other typified by Abel has something</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with the establishment of the </v>

191
00:13:14.421 --> 00:13:15.254
<v Speaker 2>antithesis of murderous resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can associate murderous </v>

192
00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:19.004
<v Speaker 2>resentment in a sense with hell and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can associate ables path his choices </v>

193
00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:24.164
<v Speaker 2>with heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens is that as soon as </v>

194
00:13:25.521 --> 00:13:26.354
<v Speaker 2>people become self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being divides into a domain that has </v>

195
00:13:29.991 --> 00:13:33.890
<v Speaker 2>held on one on one end and heaven on </v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

196
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.060
<v Speaker 2>and that's when we hinted that in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second story in genesis.</v>

197
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.150
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything dissolves into a flood.</v>

198
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.030
<v Speaker 2>That's Noah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Into a flood,</v>

199
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 2>nature comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tears,</v>

200
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:48.124
<v Speaker 2>everything down and the Tower of Babel </v>
<v Speaker 2>is erected and that's a meditation on </v>

201
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:52.504
<v Speaker 2>pride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People build a structure that's reaches </v>

202
00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:55.264
<v Speaker 2>up to where God is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a presumptuous act and there's </v>

203
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.233
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason for that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the consistent warnings that </v>

204
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:02.884
<v Speaker 2>emerges in the biblical writings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his warnings against the sin of pride </v>

205
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:06.814
<v Speaker 2>and the sin of pride is an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>sin and it's associated with the </v>

206
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:10.504
<v Speaker 2>presupposition that you know enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do without the transcendent and the </v>

207
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:18.904
<v Speaker 2>biblical story state very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clearly continually that that is </v>

208
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>

209
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.083
<v Speaker 2>that you always have to be aware that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something transcendent that </v>

210
00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:30.460
<v Speaker 2>supersedes the domain of your knowledge</v>

211
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.480
<v Speaker 1>and and</v>

212
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.100
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what might you think of people who,</v>

213
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 2>who don't believe that well are </v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarians because they believed that</v>

214
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:44.590
<v Speaker 2>their belief is total and we know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens when people become totalitarian.</v>

215
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 2>What happens is you get the instant </v>
<v Speaker 2>creation of something on earth that very</v>

216
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 2>closely resembles hell and that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammered home in the 20th century.</v>

217
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 2>If you want to derive one lesson from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century,</v>

218
00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:58.844
<v Speaker 2>it's the totalitarian states and </v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian ideologies are not a good </v>

219
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:08.891
<v Speaker 2>way to entrap or or search after </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

220
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:11.810
<v Speaker 2>That's a mistake</v>

221
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.560
<v Speaker 2>after the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The flood is before the flood.</v>

222
00:15:19.561 --> 00:15:21.390
<v Speaker 2>That's prehistory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so far back in time.</v>

223
00:15:21.391 --> 00:15:23.220
<v Speaker 2>We can't even imagine it after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flood.</v>

224
00:15:23.221 --> 00:15:25.170
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a new beginning in a sense,</v>

225
00:15:25.171 --> 00:15:26.004
<v Speaker 2>and that's when history really starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a biblical perspective and the way </v>

226
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.753
<v Speaker 2>the Old Testament lays itself out then </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's kind of a classic hero </v>

227
00:15:34.261 --> 00:15:36.240
<v Speaker 2>myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hero myth.</v>

228
00:15:36.241 --> 00:15:39.720
<v Speaker 2>It's associated with the establishment </v>
<v Speaker 2>of states and generally speaking,</v>

229
00:15:39.721 --> 00:15:43.230
<v Speaker 2>when when societies mythologize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of their state,</v>

230
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:44.963
<v Speaker 2>they imagine a set of heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of happening with people like </v>

231
00:15:48.151 --> 00:15:52.050
<v Speaker 2>George Washington in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens automatically if the founders</v>

232
00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:53.550
<v Speaker 2>of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our state,</v>

233
00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:56.310
<v Speaker 2>our mythologized as of the great heroes </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the past.</v>

234
00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.443
<v Speaker 2>It's the great heroes of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our forefathers who established the </v>

235
00:16:00.901 --> 00:16:03.510
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course that's true and there were</v>

236
00:16:03.511 --> 00:16:04.344
<v Speaker 2>millions of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can't tell a story about </v>

237
00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:06.704
<v Speaker 2>millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all the actions of those millions of </v>

238
00:16:09.151 --> 00:16:09.984
<v Speaker 2>people are collapsed and condensed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>compressed and turned it into a kind of </v>

239
00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:13.704
<v Speaker 2>fiction that's more real than truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that describes the patterns that </v>

240
00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:18.714
<v Speaker 2>characterize how the state was founded </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Old Testament runs us through </v>

241
00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:27.610
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The heroes like Abraham for example,</v>

242
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.403
<v Speaker 2>and Jacob who are crucially involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the establishment of the policy of the </v>

243
00:16:34.901 --> 00:16:35.890
<v Speaker 2>actual state,</v>

244
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:43.690
<v Speaker 2>but something always happens as this </v>
<v Speaker 2>state is established and what happens is</v>

245
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:47.973
<v Speaker 2>the states established and then people </v>
<v Speaker 2>get off course and the leadership gets </v>

246
00:16:52.931 --> 00:16:56.770
<v Speaker 2>off course and then the state collapses </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a state of chaos,</v>

247
00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.140
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a prophetic revelation </v>
<v Speaker 2>warning of that danger,</v>

248
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.970
<v Speaker 2>and then there's a terrible period of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaotic disruption,</v>

249
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.030
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the regeneration of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

250
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.720
<v Speaker 2>That story is foreshadowed in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament by Exodus Moses story.</v>

251
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.383
<v Speaker 2>Egypt's a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A leader rises to pull everyone out of </v>

252
00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:26.210
<v Speaker 2>tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a terrible chaotic interlude.</v>

253
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.343
<v Speaker 2>The wandering in the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the reestablishment of </v>

254
00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:31.394
<v Speaker 2>the state.</v>

255
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.480
<v Speaker 2>That's an archetypal pattern that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to all of you.</v>

256
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.500
<v Speaker 2>It happens to every country in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern is here in your system of belief</v>

257
00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:44.604
<v Speaker 2>which is yours in the collective belief </v>
<v Speaker 2>and something arises like a snake and </v>

258
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.573
<v Speaker 2>now it gets to a snake to disrupt it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the state is insufficiently </v>

259
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 2>adapted to the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have all the answers.</v>

260
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.870
<v Speaker 2>It ages and becomes corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's prone to collapse and that</v>

261
00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 2>collapses a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

262
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Audit catastrophe that happens to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>every time,</v>

263
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.413
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your dreams are shattered or that </v>

264
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:15.354
<v Speaker 2>you encounter a great tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens to people when their spouse </v>

265
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:20.160
<v Speaker 2>dies or when they're diagnosed with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

266
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.300
<v Speaker 2>very dangerous illness or when their </v>
<v Speaker 2>children are damaged.</v>

267
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.430
<v Speaker 2>That event analogous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said to a snake,</v>

268
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:30.264
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly because the circuits </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your brain that detects snakes that </v>

269
00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:34.104
<v Speaker 2>other animals use to detect snakes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same circuits that we use to detect </v>

270
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:37.704
<v Speaker 2>things that go wrong and things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>always going wrong for us and we're </v>

271
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:45.900
<v Speaker 2>always collapsing into a state where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're wandering through a desert and the</v>

272
00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:46.734
<v Speaker 2>desert is a state that's bereft of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning and bereft of ideas and in that </v>

273
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:50.934
<v Speaker 2>state then we're desperately seeking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>while for the establishment of another </v>

274
00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:57.000
<v Speaker 2>state and a state that we hope will be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better state.</v>

275
00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.163
<v Speaker 2>It'll be like the last date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except there'll be more to it and </v>

276
00:18:59.731 --> 00:19:03.450
<v Speaker 2>everyone will finally be happy and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of our Utopian dream</v>

277
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.970
<v Speaker 2>and it's impossible not to be in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

278
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.340
<v Speaker 2>You're either in a state of order or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a state of chaos.</v>

279
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.100
<v Speaker 2>That's where the Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

280
00:19:16.101 --> 00:19:19.130
<v Speaker 2>believed that the world is made out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>order and chaos is because you're always</v>

281
00:19:19.131 --> 00:19:19.964
<v Speaker 2>in one of those two places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens in the old testament is </v>

282
00:19:23.481 --> 00:19:28.481
<v Speaker 2>that the limitations of the state itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>start to become apparent and they become</v>

283
00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:33.530
<v Speaker 2>apparent in that the state has </v>
<v Speaker 2>established,</v>

284
00:19:33.531 --> 00:19:35.600
<v Speaker 2>but it always collapses and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>reestablished,</v>

285
00:19:35.601 --> 00:19:38.630
<v Speaker 2>but it always collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's never permanent,</v>

286
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.873
<v Speaker 2>and and there's repetitions of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>continual repetitions of this and not </v>

287
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.183
<v Speaker 2>out of the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least the way that it's been </v>

288
00:19:46.641 --> 00:19:51.641
<v Speaker 2>constructed in Christianity is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state itself is flawed.</v>

289
00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.300
<v Speaker 2>It cannot provide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The final answer to the question,</v>

290
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.820
<v Speaker 2>what constitutes genuine redemption?</v>

291
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an important issue.</v>

292
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:06.840
<v Speaker 2>It's an important issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychologically.</v>

293
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.860
<v Speaker 2>It's an important issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politically is the state.</v>

294
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:13.230
<v Speaker 2>The final answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

295
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.603
<v Speaker 2>it's a totalitarian claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that it was claimed by people </v>

296
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:17.424
<v Speaker 2>like Stella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was certainly claimed by the </v>

297
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:18.954
<v Speaker 2>communists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was claimed by people like Hitler </v>

298
00:20:20.281 --> 00:20:21.114
<v Speaker 2>that the state was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The final answer is still claimed in </v>

299
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:25.440
<v Speaker 2>many ways in places like China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today,</v>

300
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.910
<v Speaker 2>the is subsumed underneath the state </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization in this state,</v>

301
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under Schell in the state was already in</v>

302
00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:35.064
<v Speaker 2>a state of perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you complained about its </v>

303
00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:38.190
<v Speaker 2>imperfection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you were going to be killed.</v>

304
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.063
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that the state is perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's a tremendously flawed </v>

305
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:47.010
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be pursued so hard,</v>

306
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:52.120
<v Speaker 2>people who are gripping their narrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoints that the state itself becomes</v>

307
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:52.954
<v Speaker 2>murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Old Testament sorta sums itself up </v>

308
00:20:56.141 --> 00:20:56.974
<v Speaker 2>in the book of job and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problematic summing up because joe is </v>

309
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:01.294
<v Speaker 2>tormented in all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that could possibly be </v>

310
00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:05.164
<v Speaker 2>terrible that happens to any person </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to job and he can't understand </v>

311
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:14.011
<v Speaker 2>why so job is in like a final state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unredeemed being the states,</v>

312
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:18.424
<v Speaker 2>not the answer</v>

313
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then if being is order being is chaos</v>

314
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 2>and chaos is intolerable and the state </v>
<v Speaker 2>order is not the answer,</v>

315
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:30.783
<v Speaker 2>what do you have left?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the question the new testament </v>

316
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:38.590
<v Speaker 2>attempts to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the problems with with the Soviet</v>

317
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.423
<v Speaker 2>Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

318
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.260
<v Speaker 2>was their inability to correct errors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

319
00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.094
<v Speaker 2>when you start out with an a priori </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis about what constitutes the </v>

320
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:47.944
<v Speaker 2>truth and that structures your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to make the kind of </v>

321
00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:54.214
<v Speaker 2>micro corrections that estate has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make on a continual basis in order to </v>

322
00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:02.551
<v Speaker 2>remain dynamic and fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in order to stay adaptive to reality,</v>

323
00:22:02.861 --> 00:22:04.360
<v Speaker 2>not only do you have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint,</v>

324
00:22:04.361 --> 00:22:05.194
<v Speaker 2>but you have to engage in a process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>modifying that viewpoint and the way </v>

325
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:11.320
<v Speaker 2>that you engage in the process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>modifying that viewpoint.</v>

326
00:22:11.321 --> 00:22:12.154
<v Speaker 2>There's two ways really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is continual minor adjustments as a </v>

327
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 2>consequence of paying attention.</v>

328
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.153
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're having a conversation with </v>

329
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 2>your wife or a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe it's a difficult conversation,</v>

330
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:24.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of ways that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation can go.</v>

331
00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 2>One is you can take your viewpoint and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can impose it on that person,</v>

332
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.970
<v Speaker 2>and often when people are talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're trying to do.</v>

333
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.043
<v Speaker 2>They're not having a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're doing is attempting to </v>

334
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:35.464
<v Speaker 2>impose a viewpoint that they already </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold the ear on the person that's </v>

335
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:39.490
<v Speaker 2>listening and if they're a tyrant or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bully,</v>

336
00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:40.324
<v Speaker 2>they'll do that and pay no attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever to the person's response and </v>

337
00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:43.774
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll get irritated and even violent </v>

338
00:22:44.891 --> 00:22:46.830
<v Speaker 2>if the person doesn't accept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a priority.</v>

339
00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:47.664
<v Speaker 2>Framing</v>

340
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.850
<v Speaker 2>is there an alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mother is an alternative.</v>

341
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:54.523
<v Speaker 2>The alternative is to pay attention and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to listen on the off chance that the </v>

342
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:02.840
<v Speaker 2>person that you're talking to might tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>you something you don't know,</v>

343
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.513
<v Speaker 2>but in order to listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be already convinced that </v>

344
00:23:06.711 --> 00:23:07.544
<v Speaker 2>the little theory that you're using to </v>
<v Speaker 2>orient yourself in the world isn't good </v>

345
00:23:10.221 --> 00:23:13.640
<v Speaker 2>enough because if it was good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why would you bother listening?</v>

346
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.073
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be deeply aware of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own ignorance and that's what humility </v>

347
00:23:17.211 --> 00:23:18.044
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humility means to be deeply aware of </v>

348
00:23:19.311 --> 00:23:20.144
<v Speaker 2>your own ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean to slink around in and </v>

349
00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:25.850
<v Speaker 2>ashamed manner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means to make the presupposition that</v>

350
00:23:25.851 --> 00:23:26.684
<v Speaker 2>you may still have something left to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn and that this annoying person in </v>

351
00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:29.804
<v Speaker 2>front of you might have something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach you if you would just listen and </v>

352
00:23:33.951 --> 00:23:37.580
<v Speaker 2>so you're discussing a problem and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

353
00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Is this a time when the things you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't working?</v>

354
00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:41.743
<v Speaker 2>That's what constitutes a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have a little problem and you're </v>

355
00:23:44.211 --> 00:23:45.044
<v Speaker 2>discussing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's with your wife and she offers you </v>

356
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:49.124
<v Speaker 2>her opinion and you can brush it off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case your little state stays </v>

357
00:23:53.931 --> 00:23:55.040
<v Speaker 2>intact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't move,</v>

358
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:55.874
<v Speaker 2>it's still made out of stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pillars and you're still a tyrant </v>

359
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 2>or you can listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think,</v>

360
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see there,</v>

361
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:02.653
<v Speaker 2>there's a micro correction that I need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make in one of the peripheral </v>

362
00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:06.824
<v Speaker 2>elements of my belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a little painful because it </v>

363
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:11.230
<v Speaker 2>means you have to let something go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your your,</v>

364
00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.240
<v Speaker 2>your presumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to be a little chaotic</v>

365
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:18.200
<v Speaker 2>as you adjust to the new information and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to reconstitute yourself,</v>

366
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 2>and what that means interestingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

367
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:23.180
<v Speaker 2>is that you have to make a sacrifice.</v>

368
00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.800
<v Speaker 2>God likes sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're of the proper kind</v>

369
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.993
<v Speaker 2>and the proper kind of sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that you made of your micro </v>

370
00:24:31.251 --> 00:24:32.084
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're faced with evidence of </v>

371
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:33.764
<v Speaker 2>error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you make those sorts of micro </v>

372
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:36.254
<v Speaker 2>sacrifices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then God stays pleased with you and the </v>

373
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:42.290
<v Speaker 2>reason for that is that your models of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world stay up to date.</v>

374
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.323
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that happened in the </v>

375
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:45.734
<v Speaker 2>old testament all the time is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are making sacrifices to God and </v>

376
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:50.440
<v Speaker 2>modern people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just have no idea what I like.</v>

377
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Why does God want burnt lamb smoke?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not obvious to modern people,</v>

378
00:24:57.681 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 2>but you know you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ancestors were stupid.</v>

379
00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:00.973
<v Speaker 2>They were dramatizing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were dramatizing this tremendous </v>

380
00:25:04.221 --> 00:25:07.640
<v Speaker 2>realization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no other creature has ever managed,</v>

381
00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:08.474
<v Speaker 2>which is that there are things you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do to your being that change the nature </v>

382
00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:17.660
<v Speaker 2>of reality and if you do them properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make reality better.</v>

383
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.003
<v Speaker 2>It's mind boggling and they acted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>out because they didn't really </v>

384
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:22.214
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They noticed that if things weren't </v>

385
00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:26.354
<v Speaker 2>going right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to sacrifice something valuable </v>

386
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.700
<v Speaker 2>and that seemed to make God happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

387
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.720
<v Speaker 2>it might've been a firstborn calf or </v>
<v Speaker 2>firstborn son for that matter,</v>

388
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 2>for modern people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more like an idea.</v>

389
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.153
<v Speaker 2>You have to sacrifice an idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold dear in order to progress because </v>

390
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:47.060
<v Speaker 2>the ideas that you hold dear are exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are making you suffer.</v>

391
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 2>If you're suffering</v>

392
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.700
<v Speaker 2>so you have to sacrifice them and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to let them go,</v>

393
00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:53.534
<v Speaker 2>and the consequences of that is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>enter into this little period of chaos </v>

394
00:25:56.031 --> 00:25:58.040
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe you pop out of that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing,</v>

395
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.570
<v Speaker 2>and so here's an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>observation.</v>

396
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:09.070
<v Speaker 2>That process of being in the state and </v>
<v Speaker 2>identifying an error and correcting it,</v>

397
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.100
<v Speaker 2>that's a little death and rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the Phoenix.</v>

398
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.430
<v Speaker 2>The Phoenix dissolved itself into ashes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then pops back up as a.</v>

399
00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:18.680
<v Speaker 2>As a new bird</v>

400
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.060
<v Speaker 2>in the new testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this weird idea for that.</v>

401
00:26:24.061 --> 00:26:24.894
<v Speaker 2>You have to identify with a person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually dies in his reward or what </v>

402
00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:31.674
<v Speaker 2>does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that the idea that redemption </v>

403
00:26:36.751 --> 00:26:39.720
<v Speaker 2>itself is not the consequences of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a state.</v>

404
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.633
<v Speaker 2>It's the consequence of participating in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a process and the process is the </v>

405
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:49.860
<v Speaker 2>willingness to continually have yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificed,</v>

406
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.110
<v Speaker 2>chaotic and then reward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what keeps things alive.</v>

407
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

408
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:58.663
<v Speaker 2>in the passion story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other elements and the </v>

409
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:04.200
<v Speaker 2>elements are important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

410
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:10.790
<v Speaker 2>the story of Christ is predicated on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>assumption that the person who is making</v>

411
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.670
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate sacrifices performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

412
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:14.603
<v Speaker 2>a number of acts or undergoes a number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of processes and one is a disciplined </v>

413
00:27:17.971 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 2>apprenticeship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

414
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.980
<v Speaker 2>in order to have some ideas that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>let go and then reconstitute,</v>

415
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:27.930
<v Speaker 2>you have to have some ideas.</v>

416
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:33.410
<v Speaker 2>You can't just be all chaotic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uninformed and so in the New Testament,</v>

417
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Christ is a master of tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a master of the law and you have to</v>

418
00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:40.524
<v Speaker 2>be disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be a master of something </v>

419
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 2>before you're formed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be imbued with the spirit of</v>

420
00:27:46.321 --> 00:27:49.100
<v Speaker 2>your ancestors will say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to take on that.</v>

421
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:50.603
<v Speaker 2>That burden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see this reflected in popular </v>

422
00:27:52.561 --> 00:27:53.700
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

423
00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:54.534
<v Speaker 2>in the Movie Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the movie when Pinocchio </v>

424
00:27:57.871 --> 00:27:58.704
<v Speaker 2>is about to become a real boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his last challenge is to rescue his </v>

425
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:06.060
<v Speaker 2>father and he does that and to rescue </v>
<v Speaker 2>the father means to make peace with your</v>

426
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:06.894
<v Speaker 2>culture and to embody it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then not to assume that that's </v>

427
00:28:09.301 --> 00:28:13.260
<v Speaker 2>absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a necessary process of discipline.</v>

428
00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.413
<v Speaker 2>The next idea that underlies the passion</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas in the new testament is that the </v>

429
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:28.161
<v Speaker 2>ultimate sacrifice is the sacrifice of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself to God.</v>

430
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.223
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very strange idea and it's a </v>

431
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:33.294
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very sophisticated idea because what </v>

432
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:35.184
<v Speaker 2>happens in the old testament is there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the constant sacrificing of something </v>

433
00:28:38.611 --> 00:28:39.444
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This requires a different order of </v>

434
00:28:43.951 --> 00:28:44.784
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean to offer yourself up </v>

435
00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:49.980
<v Speaker 2>as a sacrifice to God?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

436
00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.733
<v Speaker 2>can think of God as an inevitable </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of the highest possible </v>

437
00:28:57.941 --> 00:29:00.730
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what monotheistic pursue memory,</v>

438
00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.180
<v Speaker 2>presumed God's nameable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the Israelites presumed that garden</v>

439
00:29:04.181 --> 00:29:06.670
<v Speaker 2>wasn't nameable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's inevitable,</v>

440
00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:09.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's the ultimate value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the ultimate value is,</v>

441
00:29:09.281 --> 00:29:13.150
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to have some idea and the</v>

442
00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:13.984
<v Speaker 2>idea of offering yourself up as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice to God is the same thing as </v>

443
00:29:16.451 --> 00:29:17.284
<v Speaker 2>determining that your life will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>guided by unshakable commitment to the </v>

444
00:29:21.041 --> 00:29:21.874
<v Speaker 2>highest good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that means is that it's no </v>

445
00:29:23.951 --> 00:29:24.784
<v Speaker 2>longer your state that's in charger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer your ego that's in </v>

446
00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:31.330
<v Speaker 2>charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even you that's in charge.</v>

447
00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.313
<v Speaker 2>It means that your conversations with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are no longer going to be </v>

448
00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:37.280
<v Speaker 2>about convincing them that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint is a right.</v>

449
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.823
<v Speaker 2>It means that what your conversation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be about in your speech about </v>

450
00:29:41.381 --> 00:29:46.381
<v Speaker 2>attempting to represent what you believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be true in the most concise and clear</v>

451
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:50.680
<v Speaker 2>possible manner no matter what,</v>

452
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.210
<v Speaker 2>and that's not how people live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People live in a sense by.</v>

453
00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:02.420
<v Speaker 2>It's like a conniving and the conniving </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a totalitarian,</v>

454
00:30:02.461 --> 00:30:03.294
<v Speaker 2>conniving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The conniving is an idea that the world </v>

455
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.180
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be the way that I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

456
00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.163
<v Speaker 2>I have a theory about how I want it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be and I'm going to enforce that theory </v>

457
00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:13.913
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to be very angry when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world doesn't respond the way I wanted </v>

458
00:30:15.931 --> 00:30:16.764
<v Speaker 2>to and maybe even be violent as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of it and I have some sense </v>

459
00:30:19.801 --> 00:30:23.400
<v Speaker 2>of where I'm headed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm headed for wealth for example,</v>

460
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:24.503
<v Speaker 2>and I'm headed to an advertisement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm with my wife when I'm 50 on a </v>

461
00:30:27.361 --> 00:30:30.330
<v Speaker 2>tropical beach and that's how I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be redeemed.</v>

462
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.810
<v Speaker 2>And it's a narrow and totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint.</v>

463
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:33.663
<v Speaker 2>And then I sacrificed everything to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it turns out that that's a very bad </v>

464
00:30:36.661 --> 00:30:37.494
<v Speaker 2>idea because things don't turn out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way I want them to turn out and the </v>

465
00:30:41.551 --> 00:30:42.384
<v Speaker 2>alternative to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is part of what happens in the </v>

466
00:30:44.671 --> 00:30:45.960
<v Speaker 2>sermon on the mount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very,</v>

467
00:30:45.961 --> 00:30:46.794
<v Speaker 2>very strange document because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents a transformation from the </v>

468
00:30:50.491 --> 00:30:51.324
<v Speaker 2>idea that morality is constituted by </v>
<v Speaker 2>adherence to a set of rules to morality </v>

469
00:30:55.411 --> 00:30:59.250
<v Speaker 2>being aimed at something that you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about as more of a positive good.</v>

470
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.130
<v Speaker 2>It's not merely not doing what's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something else.</v>

471
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.083
<v Speaker 2>It's sacrificing yourself in the attempt</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make things better and making things </v>

472
00:31:07.981 --> 00:31:10.080
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not by aiming at what's better,</v>

473
00:31:10.081 --> 00:31:14.880
<v Speaker 2>but by telling what's true and assuming </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you do that,</v>

474
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.780
<v Speaker 2>then what's better will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that is,</v>

475
00:31:18.781 --> 00:31:20.520
<v Speaker 2>because the thing is you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's better.</v>

476
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:25.230
<v Speaker 2>You don't have the capacity to fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize what would constitute better.</v>

477
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.970
<v Speaker 2>When we've seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

478
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.260
<v Speaker 2>over and over in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people aim at a circumscribed definition</v>

479
00:31:31.261 --> 00:31:35.130
<v Speaker 2>of what constitutes the Utopian state </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all we get out of that is endless.</v>

480
00:31:35.131 --> 00:31:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to pursue what's good,</v>

481
00:31:38.011 --> 00:31:40.770
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know what's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's good is,</v>

482
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:41.933
<v Speaker 2>so how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we remove ourselves from that </v>

483
00:31:45.031 --> 00:31:46.710
<v Speaker 2>paradox?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

484
00:31:46.711 --> 00:31:49.080
<v Speaker 2>it isn't a matter of gathering more </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

485
00:31:49.081 --> 00:31:49.914
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of approaching reality in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a different manner and it is an act of </v>

486
00:31:53.701 --> 00:31:54.534
<v Speaker 2>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his character guard point to code </v>

487
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:59.700
<v Speaker 2>because if you decide for example that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pursue the highest good,</v>

488
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:03.300
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is and the highest good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursuing the highest good means.</v>

489
00:32:03.301 --> 00:32:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Being willing to transform what your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conception of the highest good is.</v>

490
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.980
<v Speaker 2>You pursue the highest good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your aim.</v>

491
00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Your aim determines the world you live </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

492
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.540
<v Speaker 2>We know that that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a psychological fact.</v>

493
00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:21.690
<v Speaker 2>What you aim at determines the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your world and to aim wrong.</v>

494
00:32:22.271 --> 00:32:23.710
<v Speaker 2>That's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Markia by the way,</v>

495
00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:28.711
<v Speaker 2>that's a great word to a wrong that sin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Hamartia,</v>

496
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.303
<v Speaker 2>which is an archery term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means to miss the target is what </v>

497
00:32:32.081 --> 00:32:36.890
<v Speaker 2>sin means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a not in a state of grace,</v>

498
00:32:36.891 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>it means your age wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Naming it the right thing,</v>

499
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.880
<v Speaker 2>or maybe the world is constituted badly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's hell bent on torturing you.</v>

500
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 2>That's the alternative viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get your aim right.</v>

501
00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 2>You name it the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how do you aim?</v>

502
00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.213
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sermon on the mount says something </v>

503
00:32:54.121 --> 00:32:55.050
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

504
00:32:55.051 --> 00:32:55.500
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

505
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.710
<v Speaker 2>You get your aim right and you decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>to tell the truth.</v>

506
00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Then all you have to do is concentrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the day.</v>

507
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Now people read the sermon on the mount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hippy document.</v>

508
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like a flower and be like a bird.</v>

509
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.113
<v Speaker 2>Don't pay any attention to the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know everything will be taken care </v>

510
00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that at all.</v>

511
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.300
<v Speaker 2>There's presumptions that are nested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and the presumption is,</v>

512
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:20.240
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're aiming at at perfection.</v>

513
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.553
<v Speaker 2>You're aiming at whatever perfection is </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not trying to get other </v>

514
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:26.630
<v Speaker 2>people to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're aiming at it.</v>

515
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.050
<v Speaker 2>You're reconstituting your actions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your speech to aim at that,</v>

516
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.173
<v Speaker 2>and then you do that by noticing very </v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully and attending to what </v>

517
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:35.954
<v Speaker 2>constitutes the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you let that take you wherever </v>

518
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:39.584
<v Speaker 2>it will go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the sacrifice of self to God </v>

519
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:44.503
<v Speaker 2>because you the truth is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of whatever constitutes </v>

520
00:33:46.761 --> 00:33:47.594
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your best attempt at whatever </v>

521
00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:49.784
<v Speaker 2>constitutes reality and to follow that </v>
<v Speaker 2>leans to follow something that's </v>

522
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:55.280
<v Speaker 2>transcendent because whatever reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

523
00:33:55.281 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly not something that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>individually responsible for creating,</v>

524
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:03.560
<v Speaker 2>even though you might participate in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that process to speak.</v>

525
00:34:03.561 --> 00:34:08.561
<v Speaker 2>The truth is to be guided by being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely different motive being</v>

526
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.043
<v Speaker 2>now I said right after Adam and Eve's </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic emergence into self </v>

527
00:34:17.991 --> 00:34:21.290
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world split into two attitudes,</v>

528
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:22.124
<v Speaker 2>one associated with pain and the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with Abel can that those </v>

529
00:34:26.391 --> 00:34:29.870
<v Speaker 2>attitudes are associated with heaven and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>

530
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:33.773
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that human beings can turn the </v>

531
00:34:34.411 --> 00:34:38.210
<v Speaker 2>world into help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a student of history,</v>

532
00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:39.044
<v Speaker 2>you have no doubt about that and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter how terrible you think the hell </v>

533
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:47.870
<v Speaker 2>that people have created in the past is </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you read a little more history,</v>

534
00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.360
<v Speaker 2>you will find something even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

535
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:56.020
<v Speaker 2>And people of course are afraid of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human capacity to turn things into hell.</v>

536
00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.400
<v Speaker 2>That that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlies our environmental,</v>

537
00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.243
<v Speaker 2>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're afraid that our misbehavior will </v>

538
00:35:00.941 --> 00:35:03.610
<v Speaker 2>turn the world into help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be,</v>

539
00:35:03.611 --> 00:35:08.611
<v Speaker 2>we believe we can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we believe that human beings can turn</v>

540
00:35:09.861 --> 00:35:12.290
<v Speaker 2>the world into heaven?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

541
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:13.124
<v Speaker 2>that's a harder thing to believe it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a lot more ways that </v>

542
00:35:14.871 --> 00:35:15.704
<v Speaker 2>things could go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there are ways that things can go </v>

543
00:35:17.121 --> 00:35:17.954
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so heaven's a much narrower thing to a </v>

544
00:35:20.331 --> 00:35:22.700
<v Speaker 2>map than hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a chaotic mess.</v>

545
00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

546
00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's improbable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but life is improbable.</v>

547
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:31.853
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our unredeemed state of being is </v>

548
00:35:34.801 --> 00:35:35.634
<v Speaker 2>improbable and the other that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>improbable is the burden that we're </v>

549
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:41.490
<v Speaker 2>required to carry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Existentially,</v>

550
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.240
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're awake creatures of God.</v>

551
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.100
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

552
00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.253
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we suffer and it's real that </v>

553
00:35:53.241 --> 00:35:55.210
<v Speaker 2>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not only that we suffer in that</v>

554
00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.053
<v Speaker 2>we feel pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is bad enough in frustration and </v>

555
00:35:57.591 --> 00:35:58.424
<v Speaker 2>disappointment and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic things that are associated </v>

556
00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:01.310
<v Speaker 2>with life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even worse,</v>

557
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:04.670
<v Speaker 2>we can apprehend the possibility of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>recurring in the future.</v>

558
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:08.840
<v Speaker 2>So even when none of those terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>things happen to be happening right now,</v>

559
00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:09.973
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty easy for us to imagine that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to happen tomorrow and </v>

560
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:13.123
<v Speaker 2>they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not only can we imagine that they're </v>

561
00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.110
<v Speaker 2>going to happen again tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are going to happen again tomorrow.</v>

562
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.960
<v Speaker 2>So we're in a state of constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>unredeemed suffering.</v>

563
00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.610
<v Speaker 2>It's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

564
00:36:22.611 --> 00:36:23.444
<v Speaker 2>if you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even imagine a state that </v>

565
00:36:25.071 --> 00:36:28.190
<v Speaker 2>would address that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too big a problem.</v>

566
00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then there's another inference in the</v>

567
00:36:32.351 --> 00:36:36.130
<v Speaker 2>new testament and it's hypothesis of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>metta state,</v>

568
00:36:36.131 --> 00:36:41.131
<v Speaker 2>and the inference is that a life that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on constant death and renewal</v>

569
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:43.643
<v Speaker 2>at every level of being a life that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>predicated on a search for the truth </v>

570
00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.253
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an attempt to act out the truth and </v>

571
00:36:52.291 --> 00:36:53.124
<v Speaker 2>our life that's associated with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice of self to God produces a </v>

572
00:36:57.571 --> 00:37:02.571
<v Speaker 2>state of being that so deeply meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it justifies suffering,</v>

573
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.100
<v Speaker 2>doesn't eliminate suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no elimination of suffering.</v>

574
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.523
<v Speaker 2>Nisha said he hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He who has a why can bear any how and </v>

575
00:37:18.681 --> 00:37:23.681
<v Speaker 2>what he meant by that was if what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>aiming at is of sufficient profundity,</v>

576
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.333
<v Speaker 2>it's worth an awful lot of misery to </v>
<v Speaker 2>participate in the process of bringing </v>

577
00:37:33.181 --> 00:37:34.014
<v Speaker 2>it about and life has an unbearable </v>
<v Speaker 2>depth of misery and as a consequence it </v>

578
00:37:42.171 --> 00:37:47.171
<v Speaker 2>needs a and observe positive aim and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>observed positive aim.</v>

579
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.553
<v Speaker 2>It's positive in the new testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is participation in the process that </v>

580
00:38:01.281 --> 00:38:02.114
<v Speaker 2>transforms earth into heaven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the generation of the Kingdom of God on </v>

581
00:38:06.871 --> 00:38:09.720
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that actually means something.</v>

582
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:12.263
<v Speaker 2>It means that the state of being that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>described by the parameters that I </v>

583
00:38:19.751 --> 00:38:20.584
<v Speaker 2>already laid out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the willingness to engage in Inter </v>

584
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:30.950
<v Speaker 2>eternal sacrificial death and renewal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sacrifice of the self to the highest</v>

585
00:38:31.251 --> 00:38:32.084
<v Speaker 2>value produces a state of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjectively that's associated with </v>

586
00:38:37.751 --> 00:38:42.751
<v Speaker 2>habitation in the Kingdom of God and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>actions that are conducted in that state</v>

587
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.033
<v Speaker 2>are what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Transform the interpersonal state into </v>

588
00:38:48.551 --> 00:38:53.170
<v Speaker 2>the political state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a manifestation of that kingdom.</v>

589
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:55.543
<v Speaker 2>Now you all know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know this the same way that the </v>

590
00:39:00.291 --> 00:39:01.124
<v Speaker 2>people who wrote the Bible know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of course people just like you </v>

591
00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.100
<v Speaker 2>wrote the Bible in the Bible is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

592
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:12.170
<v Speaker 2>When you have a deeply meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with someone,</v>

593
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.673
<v Speaker 2>you change them and you change yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that and the process that </v>

594
00:39:20.111 --> 00:39:20.944
<v Speaker 2>you're engaged in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while you have that deeply meaningful </v>

595
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:23.104
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a mode of being and that motive </v>

596
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.453
<v Speaker 2>being to the degree that that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>motive being is predicated on the </v>

597
00:39:31.121 --> 00:39:31.954
<v Speaker 2>attempt to communicate as truthfully as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible and with the highest possible </v>

598
00:39:37.571 --> 00:39:41.470
<v Speaker 2>end in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then right then and there,</v>

599
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:42.363
<v Speaker 2>you're in that state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can tell when you're in that </v>

600
00:39:45.991 --> 00:39:48.840
<v Speaker 2>state because number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not self conscious.</v>

601
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Time disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>

602
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:54.600
<v Speaker 2>what you're engaged in is deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful.</v>

603
00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.293
<v Speaker 2>You don't bear the tragic burden of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life at that moment because what's </v>

604
00:40:01.321 --> 00:40:02.154
<v Speaker 2>happening with you is so worthwhile that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it consumes you completely and people </v>

605
00:40:09.811 --> 00:40:14.811
<v Speaker 2>are in that state to a widely varying </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree,</v>

606
00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:18.163
<v Speaker 2>but everyone is in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when something like that </v>

607
00:40:20.721 --> 00:40:24.920
<v Speaker 2>happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially once you learn to notice it,</v>

608
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:27.243
<v Speaker 1>you think</v>

609
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:34.050
<v Speaker 2>while there's nothing better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if there's nothing better than that,</v>

610
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:40.510
<v Speaker 2>then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do anything else now?</v>

611
00:40:43.221 --> 00:40:46.070
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to figure that out for years.</v>

612
00:40:46.071 --> 00:40:48.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because to me,</v>

613
00:40:48.141 --> 00:40:52.250
<v Speaker 2>these look like existential realities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not hypothetical states.</v>

614
00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:57.080
<v Speaker 2>They're not shoved off into some </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent heaven.</v>

615
00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.100
<v Speaker 2>They're not other worldly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're part of being itself.</v>

616
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.983
<v Speaker 2>People can enter states of heaven and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell and they can learn to stay longer </v>

617
00:41:08.691 --> 00:41:09.524
<v Speaker 2>in one state or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why don't they stay in the best </v>

618
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:15.370
<v Speaker 2>possible state?</v>

619
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.813
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

620
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:20.403
<v Speaker 2>one problem is the commitment of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very terrifying to let go </v>

621
00:41:24.431 --> 00:41:27.400
<v Speaker 2>of the direction of your life and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

622
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:31.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go wherever the attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak the truth will pick me because God</v>

623
00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:35.240
<v Speaker 2>only knows where you're going to end up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's certainly not where you think.</v>

624
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:36.283
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the willingness to abandoned going to </v>

625
00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:40.910
<v Speaker 2>where you think is a prerequisite for </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>

626
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.273
<v Speaker 2>and so in a sense you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a ship that the wind takes </v>

627
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:49.334
<v Speaker 2>wherever it wants to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the second problem I think is that </v>

628
00:41:53.171 --> 00:41:58.171
<v Speaker 2>it's a real responsibility because in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to undertake this process,</v>

629
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:06.630
<v Speaker 2>you have to come to terms with the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that what you do in your life,</v>

630
00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.860
<v Speaker 2>you're wretched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable,</v>

631
00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:12.660
<v Speaker 2>tragic prone life actually matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really it matters.</v>

632
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:14.023
<v Speaker 2>You know when people complain about </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaninglessness in their life all the </v>

633
00:42:16.531 --> 00:42:18.060
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's,</v>

634
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:21.223
<v Speaker 2>that's a kind of face saving illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are more afraid of </v>

635
00:42:24.471 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 2>meaning than they are of meaninglessness</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of meaningless means.</v>

636
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Meaninglessness means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

637
00:42:29.541 --> 00:42:30.374
<v Speaker 2>I can do whatever I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might be kind of second rate </v>

638
00:42:33.051 --> 00:42:35.870
<v Speaker 2>and might be dull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be dangerous,</v>

639
00:42:35.871 --> 00:42:38.720
<v Speaker 2>it might be destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

640
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:41.570
<v Speaker 2>So I can do whatever I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no responsibility because I don't</v>

641
00:42:41.571 --> 00:42:42.404
<v Speaker 2>mean anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not responsible to anything or </v>

642
00:42:46.071 --> 00:42:46.904
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if your life actually has meaning </v>

643
00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:51.380
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't always have meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has meaning.</v>

644
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.600
<v Speaker 2>When you're doing something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful,</v>

645
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 2>well then all of a sudden you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible to a higher power,</v>

646
00:42:57.921 --> 00:42:58.754
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're responsible to your own soul and </v>

647
00:43:02.241 --> 00:43:05.990
<v Speaker 2>you're responsible to the state of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>that characterizes the world itself,</v>

648
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.340
<v Speaker 2>and that's a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive responsibility.</v>

649
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:17.500
<v Speaker 2>It's to take responsibility in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to take responsibility for the sins</v>

650
00:43:17.501 --> 00:43:18.334
<v Speaker 2>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another prerequisite of the </v>

651
00:43:20.381 --> 00:43:22.300
<v Speaker 2>motive being that's described in the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>testaments,</v>

652
00:43:22.301 --> 00:43:23.134
<v Speaker 2>a very strange idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The redeemer takes on the sins of the </v>

653
00:43:25.481 --> 00:43:27.010
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

654
00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:28.533
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it means,</v>

655
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.633
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are Nazis and human beings </v>

656
00:43:34.681 --> 00:43:35.514
<v Speaker 2>are the red garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human beings are the slaughterers in </v>

657
00:43:40.711 --> 00:43:41.544
<v Speaker 2>Rwanda and we're all human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so to take on the sins of the world </v>

658
00:43:46.411 --> 00:43:47.244
<v Speaker 2>means to realize that all those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that characterize the human capacity to </v>

659
00:43:50.341 --> 00:43:53.190
<v Speaker 2>turn the earth into hell characterize </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

660
00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.253
<v Speaker 2>and then in order to live properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to live in a manner that </v>

661
00:43:58.141 --> 00:44:00.960
<v Speaker 2>addresses those elements of your nature.</v>

662
00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.400
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

663
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:06.910
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

664
00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:08.560
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wants to admit that?</v>

665
00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can stand looking at it and third,</v>

666
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.680
<v Speaker 2>who's going to take on the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 2>solving it?</v>

667
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:17.723
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it better be all of us or we're just </v>

668
00:44:19.531 --> 00:44:23.290
<v Speaker 2>going to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So redemption,</v>

669
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.280
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean?</v>

670
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:29.770
<v Speaker 2>It means we're not in a state of grace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

671
00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:34.923
<v Speaker 2>We're self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're aware of the owner of the tragedy </v>

672
00:44:36.851 --> 00:44:37.684
<v Speaker 2>of our being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're unwilling to take full </v>

673
00:44:39.761 --> 00:44:40.594
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for it or were ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how to do that and that leaves us </v>

674
00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.670
<v Speaker 2>bereft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we solve that?</v>

675
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can solve it with a estate,</v>

676
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.810
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is the state is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable.</v>

677
00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 2>It degenerated into tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it transforms into chaos.</v>

678
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Then it reconstitutes itself and does </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing again.</v>

679
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there another answer?</v>

680
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

681
00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.073
<v Speaker 2>I believe that what is outlined in </v>
<v Speaker 2>narrative form in the new testament is </v>

682
00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:23.274
<v Speaker 2>psychologically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the idea that endless </v>

683
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:29.483
<v Speaker 2>micro death and renewal produces a state</v>
<v Speaker 2>of proper ad outpatient to being and </v>

684
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.070
<v Speaker 2>that the prerequisites for that that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>laid out in the narrative structure that</v>

685
00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:42.980
<v Speaker 2>underlies the new testament are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally correct.</v>

686
00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.790
<v Speaker 2>So to be redeemed is to aim at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest value,</v>

687
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.733
<v Speaker 2>to sacrifice what's no longer useful and</v>
<v Speaker 2>valid in yourself and to tell the truth </v>

688
00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.813
<v Speaker 2>and the consequence of that is existence</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a deep state of meaning that </v>

689
00:46:01.621 --> 00:46:02.454
<v Speaker 2>justifies the tragedy of being and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of transforming your own </v>

690
00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:07.944
<v Speaker 2>life in the most beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive direction while simultaneously </v>

691
00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:16.050
<v Speaker 2>doing that for the people around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's redemption.</v>

692
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

693
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
