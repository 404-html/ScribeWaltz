1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.970
<v Speaker 1>When I started working on this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I guess when,</v>

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.893
<v Speaker 1>when it started working on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably really in the mid </v>

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.710
<v Speaker 1>eighties and I found myself suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>from two things.</v>

4
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>One was a very lengthy sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmares about nuclear destruction,</v>

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.253
<v Speaker 1>and they were very as affecting dreams </v>
<v Speaker 1>and associated with that was a sense of </v>

6
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>amazement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dream that was,</v>

7
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:34.794
<v Speaker 1>that awful could reflect a reality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be that awful and an additional </v>

8
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.013
<v Speaker 1>amazement at the fact that despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>production of thousands and tens and </v>

9
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:48.864
<v Speaker 1>thousands of weapons of unimaginable </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction and the qualitative </v>

10
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.713
<v Speaker 1>qualitative change in human capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that represented that people could go </v>

11
00:00:58.951 --> 00:00:59.784
<v Speaker 1>about their day to day lives without </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting as if anything fundamental </v>

12
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever had changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

13
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.253
<v Speaker 1>I've never really been able to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out why that disturbed me so much when </v>

14
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to not disturb to any profound</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

15
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people I knew but doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really matter.</v>

16
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.473
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the upshot of it was of it was that I </v>

17
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>spent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably spent my whole life trying to</v>

18
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>understand what evil was and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly,</v>

19
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.370
<v Speaker 1>what might be done about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.633
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange pursuit in some ways for </v>
<v Speaker 1>an academic done undertake because </v>

21
00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>academics tend to talk about academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

22
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>And one thing you can say about evil is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that whatever it is,</v>

23
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not bloody well academic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an intellectual issue,</v>

24
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>it's an existential issue and it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical issue,</v>

25
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:50.514
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an issue that deals with that </v>

26
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.843
<v Speaker 1>absolute nature of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess sometimes I think that </v>

27
00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>people go into academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into academia,</v>

28
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:00.534
<v Speaker 1>did shield themselves from having to ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions about the absolute nature of </v>

29
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

30
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.993
<v Speaker 1>I think before you can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something before you can dare to talk </v>

31
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:12.744
<v Speaker 1>about something like evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do some thinking about what </v>

32
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>it is that you're talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitionally speaking.</v>

33
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.003
<v Speaker 1>I learned this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe from historian named Jeffrey </v>

34
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.833
<v Speaker 1>Burton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell,</v>

35
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.823
<v Speaker 1>who wrote a very detailed history of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the devil and the 19 eighties </v>

36
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>when such histories were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were strange to say the least.</v>

37
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>He was very interested in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the embodiment of ideas of evil.</v>

38
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:38.784
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he his work did </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me was to help me clarify the </v>

39
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>distinction between two terrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distinction,</v>

40
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.683
<v Speaker 1>a distinction that has to be made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the distinction between </v>

41
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:50.244
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and evil and I don't think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can talk about it evil at all until you </v>

42
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:54.414
<v Speaker 1>distinguish it from tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to try to distinguish </v>

43
00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:57.864
<v Speaker 1>evil from tragedy by making some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference to the essential existential </v>

44
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:01.294
<v Speaker 1>condition of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the nature of human </v>

45
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>being is such that it consists of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>confrontation with the bounded finite,</v>

46
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:10.804
<v Speaker 1>with the unbounded infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are the bare facts of the </v>

47
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

48
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.333
<v Speaker 1>And the facts are that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of experience as it presents </v>

49
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.983
<v Speaker 1>itself to us is literally and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically complex beyond our </v>

50
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:25.624
<v Speaker 1>capacity to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that people deal in a </v>

51
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>real sense on an ongoing basis with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>

52
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.513
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that that fact is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why religious experiences </v>

53
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>essentially and belief is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>endemic to mankind.</v>

54
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.753
<v Speaker 1>It's a human universal and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people believe it's because </v>

55
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>human existence as such consists of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>confrontation between the finite and the</v>

56
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>infinite and religious systems merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>take that into account.</v>

57
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our finitude in the face of the infinite</v>

58
00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:58.504
<v Speaker 1>has some inevitable consequences and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say those consequences are </v>

59
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>essentially the existential conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

60
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.073
<v Speaker 1>The first of those consequences is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the finite is always overwhelmed by the </v>

61
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.244
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be because it can't </v>

62
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>encapsulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what that means is that it's that</v>

63
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:15.394
<v Speaker 1>suffering is central to the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human existence and suffering exists as </v>

64
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of the consequences of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>

65
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.183
<v Speaker 1>I mean every single person who's alive </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to die and every single person </v>

66
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:29.194
<v Speaker 1>who's alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to deal with with serious </v>

67
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>physical illness and mental distress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't suffer,</v>

68
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 1>if they aren't suffering directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately right now on their own,</v>

69
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.973
<v Speaker 1>it's almost inevitably the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single person who walks the earth </v>

70
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.523
<v Speaker 1>is confronting the bare bones of reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that level in the guise of an </v>

71
00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:47.574
<v Speaker 1>afflicted family member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact of our affinity duties </v>

72
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.161
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

73
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:51.994
<v Speaker 1>no academic issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's essential to the nature of our </v>

74
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>being and we're forced to deal with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on an ongoing basis.</v>

75
00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.943
<v Speaker 1>So I would say insufficiency is built </v>
<v Speaker 1>into human experience and their </v>

76
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 1>existential consequences to that.</v>

77
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.563
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read something a long time ago and I </v>

78
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:09.334
<v Speaker 1>don't remember who wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was written about Jewish </v>

79
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>commentary on the Torah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Is Omniscient,</v>

80
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>omnipotent and omnipresent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he lack?</v>

81
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Announcers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitation.</v>

82
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

83
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.083
<v Speaker 1>that's a riddle and announcer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unparalleled brilliance as far as I'm </v>

84
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:31.024
<v Speaker 1>concerned because I think it speaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply to something about the central </v>

85
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>nature of existence itself and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>without limitation.</v>

86
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 1>There's no being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a hard thing to understand,</v>

87
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>but I think you can understand it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of different ways.</v>

88
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.003
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you might want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand is that I played this game </v>

89
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.414
<v Speaker 1>with my students sometimes in my class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come up to a student to pick them </v>

90
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 1>at poor victim at random and come up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and say,</v>

91
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to play a game.</v>

92
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Say I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

93
00:05:57.681 --> 00:05:58.371
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I say,</v>

94
00:05:58.371 --> 00:05:59.204
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move first and they don't know what </v>

95
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:01.574
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is because the </v>

96
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:04.394
<v Speaker 1>limiting parameters of the game of not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being defined and as a consequence of </v>

97
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:07.784
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're are stunned by their infinite </v>

98
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.650
<v Speaker 1>freedom into complete and mobility.</v>

99
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.580
<v Speaker 1>And what that means in a sense is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

100
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of serious constraint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there can be no choice,</v>

101
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 1>no freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no existence,</v>

102
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>and I believe this to be fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

103
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 1>just as the fact that human being as </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable is fundamentally true.</v>

104
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example I think is more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more personal to me,</v>

105
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.033
<v Speaker 1>and it emerged in my imagination as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of my contemplation of my </v>

106
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:34.514
<v Speaker 1>son's vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have children that are teenagers </v>

107
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still like them.</v>

108
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am i.</v>

109
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.573
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I was really struck by</v>
<v Speaker 1>when my children were little was how </v>

110
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:46.634
<v Speaker 1>perfect they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that that was the </v>

111
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>benevolence of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a sense.</v>

112
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>Children are tremendously difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're tremendous responsibility,</v>

113
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.650
<v Speaker 1>but they're so perfect and they manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>that perfection in such a,</v>

114
00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.753
<v Speaker 1>a remarkable way that that's the payment</v>
<v Speaker 1>for taking on the responsibility of </v>

115
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 1>bringing them into the B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into being,</v>

116
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>in caring for them.</v>

117
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.930
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about being a parent is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the vulnerability of people is made</v>

118
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>manifest to you in a way that was never </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case prior to that.</v>

119
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's haunting and it's beautiful,</v>

120
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's also exactly right in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking,</v>

121
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:22.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at my son,</v>

122
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:22.934
<v Speaker 1>he's a little kid and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to chase after him all the </v>

123
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get sick.</v>

124
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>People heard him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to be mean to him.</v>

126
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be disappointed in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

127
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.950
<v Speaker 1>He's vulnerable and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

128
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a constant tragic reality that he's</v>

129
00:07:35.301 --> 00:07:36.051
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

130
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

131
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 1>let's say we wanted to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

132
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 1>So let's say we make them so that no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>can pick on him.</v>

133
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:46.340
<v Speaker 1>So he could inflate them to about 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet high and equip them with a metallic</v>

134
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.010
<v Speaker 1>scout.</v>

135
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 1>And and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a cast iron exoskeleton,</v>

136
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:50.924
<v Speaker 1>and you could equip them with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>computerized intelligence that far </v>

137
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:54.824
<v Speaker 1>supersedes his own and you could remove </v>
<v Speaker 1>his vulnerabilities one by one </v>

138
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:58.364
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course more and more we're in a </v>

139
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>position where we could do that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

140
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.653
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I realized right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away was that as you remove the </v>

141
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>vulnerabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remove the thing you love.</v>

142
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.223
<v Speaker 1>And then I started to understand more </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply that vulnerability was a </v>

143
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.123
<v Speaker 1>precondition for human being and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a desirable preconditioned because </v>

144
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.383
<v Speaker 1>the things about human existence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are wonderful and remarkable are so </v>

145
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:25.460
<v Speaker 1>integrally tied up with vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're actually inextricable.</v>

146
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.830
<v Speaker 1>The Jewish commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the infinite lacks is the finite is</v>

147
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:36.140
<v Speaker 1>a more abstract way of getting at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

148
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.563
<v Speaker 1>If you could do absolutely anything you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted at any point and be anywhere you </v>

149
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:42.790
<v Speaker 1>want it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you wanted,</v>

150
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.653
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was nothing that was out of </v>

151
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:46.004
<v Speaker 1>your reach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be nothing to do because </v>

152
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>you'd be everything at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're everything at once,</v>

153
00:08:51.231 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 1>which is at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the position of God.</v>

154
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.450
<v Speaker 1>There's no story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no being,</v>

155
00:08:57.451 --> 00:08:58.284
<v Speaker 1>and there's something about being that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a story and without limitation </v>

156
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:01.464
<v Speaker 1>there's no story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then the question starts to become </v>

157
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 1>with regards to consideration of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>

158
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:06.923
<v Speaker 1>is there a way to conduct your life in </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a manner that the intrinsic </v>

159
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:15.741
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability that characterizes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is rendered not only acceptable but</v>

160
00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 1>desirable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to me that's the central question of</v>

161
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 1>existence and I tell you I get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

162
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.430
<v Speaker 1>You're on the wrong track and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the wrong track,</v>

163
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are in one terrible place.</v>

164
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I would say with regards to tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

165
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.273
<v Speaker 1>Humans are vulnerable and that's tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if tragedy is the price that we pay </v>

166
00:09:35.001 --> 00:09:36.590
<v Speaker 1>for existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then so be it.</v>

167
00:09:36.591 --> 00:09:40.250
<v Speaker 1>If existence is justifiable and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy itself,</v>

168
00:09:40.251 --> 00:09:42.440
<v Speaker 1>which is merely a revelation of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>

169
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.040
<v Speaker 1>can't be regarded as evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just A.</v>

170
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:51.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a condition of existence and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary to distinguish the tragic</v>

171
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.590
<v Speaker 1>conditions of existence from evil before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can even address the problem.</v>

172
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.573
<v Speaker 1>And I think what that means to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree is you should not blame on the </v>

173
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.890
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the finite and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite.</v>

174
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.043
<v Speaker 1>The terrible failings of humanity that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be laid directly at the feet of </v>

175
00:10:06.201 --> 00:10:07.034
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so earthquakes aren't evil and cancer </v>

176
00:10:09.891 --> 00:10:13.990
<v Speaker 1>isn't evil and mental illness isn't evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>and predators aren't evil.</v>

177
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.940
<v Speaker 1>They just are part of the way things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

178
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.980
<v Speaker 1>but there are certain categories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human action that are definitely outside</v>

179
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:22.814
<v Speaker 1>the parameters of mirror tragedy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the things we really have to </v>

180
00:10:25.341 --> 00:10:26.180
<v Speaker 1>get a handle on.</v>

181
00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:28.803
<v Speaker 1>Evil for me is differentiated from </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy by its lack of necessity and </v>

182
00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:34.624
<v Speaker 1>it's volunteerism and its attendant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of modern materialistic thought </v>

183
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.003
<v Speaker 1>that there are social or material causes</v>
<v Speaker 1>for actions and it's an extraordinarily </v>

184
00:10:46.481 --> 00:10:47.314
<v Speaker 1>useful theory and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think one of the unfortunate </v>

185
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.153
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that is that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>tended to write off much of human </v>

186
00:10:53.351 --> 00:10:57.460
<v Speaker 1>misbehavior and attributed to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>insufficiencies and material conditions,</v>

187
00:10:57.461 --> 00:10:58.570
<v Speaker 1>which isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an.</v>

188
00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.733
<v Speaker 1>It's not an acceptable theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are all sorts of human cultures </v>

189
00:11:02.801 --> 00:11:03.634
<v Speaker 1>that were characterized by virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete absence of material luxury </v>

190
00:11:08.321 --> 00:11:11.530
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose culture is we're highly functional</v>

191
00:11:11.531 --> 00:11:12.364
<v Speaker 1>and highly moral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to describe the propensity towards </v>

192
00:11:16.241 --> 00:11:20.860
<v Speaker 1>misbehavior as a consequence of economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality is entirely beside the point.</v>

193
00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:21.880
<v Speaker 1>As far as I'm concerned,</v>

194
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.790
<v Speaker 1>evil is more pernicious than that which </v>
<v Speaker 1>has generated,</v>

195
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.740
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by social inequality.</v>

196
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although this is a terrifying thought,</v>

197
00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:34.694
<v Speaker 1>in some ways it's more appropriate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider it a form of a demonically </v>

198
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.163
<v Speaker 1>warped aesthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll give you a couple of examples </v>

199
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:47.120
<v Speaker 1>of what I mean by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

200
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.140
<v Speaker 1>because the exam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the manifestation of this warped</v>

201
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>athetic aesthetic makes itself apparent </v>
<v Speaker 1>under certain conditions.</v>

202
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:56.044
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it made itself apparent in the </v>

203
00:11:58.721 --> 00:11:59.554
<v Speaker 1>imagination of the first politician who </v>
<v Speaker 1>coined the acronym a mad or mutually </v>

204
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:09.151
<v Speaker 1>assured destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an aesthetic of evil to to make a</v>

205
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:10.054
<v Speaker 1>joke of a situation that catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates the kind of malevolence that </v>

206
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 1>lurks behind the fact that such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition exists.</v>

207
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.223
<v Speaker 1>The motto on the gates of Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the Second World War work </v>

208
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:27.934
<v Speaker 1>will make you free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another manifestation of this </v>

209
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:32.710
<v Speaker 1>authentic of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible,</v>

210
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:33.544
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironic joke and it's instructive to </v>

211
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:38.284
<v Speaker 1>meditate on what sort of imagination </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have the arrogance to tell such a </v>

212
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:45.100
<v Speaker 1>terrible joke.</v>

213
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.120
<v Speaker 1>The concentration camps are classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of evil one,</v>

214
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.223
<v Speaker 1>I think by an analyzing at least certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of events that occurred within </v>

215
00:12:54.171 --> 00:12:55.004
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to get a clear idea of what </v>

216
00:12:56.781 --> 00:13:00.200
<v Speaker 1>evil constitutes in one of the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always haunted me,</v>

217
00:13:00.201 --> 00:13:01.034
<v Speaker 1>I guess is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's another story derived </v>

218
00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:03.344
<v Speaker 1>from Auschwitz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The prison guards in Auschwitz would </v>

219
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:06.284
<v Speaker 1>take the prisoners who were already </v>
<v Speaker 1>stripped of their dignity and to </v>

220
00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:12.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever degree possible their identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their culture and their language and</v>

221
00:13:12.831 --> 00:13:16.580
<v Speaker 1>their status of as valuable beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet that wasn't sufficient.</v>

222
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.780
<v Speaker 1>They needed to be tortured in addition </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that before they were killed.</v>

223
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:26.060
<v Speaker 1>And the torture often consisted of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>self evidently counterproductive work.</v>

224
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

225
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.493
<v Speaker 1>a situation that also frequently </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized activity in the Soviet </v>

226
00:13:31.191 --> 00:13:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago where perhaps 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people met their death.</v>

227
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.093
<v Speaker 1>A typical Auschwitz example was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement for prisoners to carry 100 </v>

228
00:13:41.711 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 1>pound sacks of wet salt from one side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the compound and then back again.</v>

229
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:46.643
<v Speaker 1>Now that's evil as far as I'm concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and you have to think about it from </v>

230
00:13:49.151 --> 00:13:54.151
<v Speaker 1>an aesthetic perspective in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a celebration of horror and</v>

231
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.153
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a conscious attempt to violate the </v>

232
00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.283
<v Speaker 1>conditions that make life itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerable and it's aimed at </v>

233
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.063
<v Speaker 1>dehumanization destruction of the ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and at an even deeper level revenge </v>

234
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>against the conditions of existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

235
00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Developmental pathway that leads to acts</v>

236
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:18.304
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My academic research as well as my </v>

237
00:14:23.991 --> 00:14:24.824
<v Speaker 1>clinical experience has revealed to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what appears to lie at the bottom </v>

238
00:14:30.381 --> 00:14:31.214
<v Speaker 1>of motivation for the excesses of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior that characterize evil are too </v>

239
00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.930
<v Speaker 1>tightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>causally related factors.</v>

240
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.443
<v Speaker 1>One arrogance and other resentment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those are tied up with </v>

241
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability of human beings</v>

242
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.600
<v Speaker 2>in the face of the infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

243
00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.070
<v Speaker 1>but tied up with something more profound</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

244
00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.790
<v Speaker 1>The most thorough account of this that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've managed,</v>

245
00:15:05.791 --> 00:15:07.710
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least a partially comprehend,</v>

246
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:08.843
<v Speaker 1>I believe is contained in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of the stories in the Old </v>

247
00:15:11.341 --> 00:15:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Genesis,</v>

248
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:15.953
<v Speaker 1>the story of Adam and eve in the fall of</v>
<v Speaker 1>man and the immediately following story </v>

249
00:15:19.561 --> 00:15:20.700
<v Speaker 1>of Cain and Abel.</v>

250
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.740
<v Speaker 1>As far as we can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are very,</v>

251
00:15:23.741 --> 00:15:26.860
<v Speaker 1>very old stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They predate Judaism,</v>

252
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.110
<v Speaker 1>at least in some of their in some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their structural elements.</v>

253
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:33.723
<v Speaker 1>It's conceivable that some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements in those stories are as old as </v>

254
00:15:36.031 --> 00:15:38.200
<v Speaker 1>the human capacity to tell stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

255
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.460
<v Speaker 1>assuming that they were grounded in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oral tradition that predated the written</v>

256
00:15:42.461 --> 00:15:43.294
<v Speaker 1>tradition and we know that oral </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditions can last at least in some </v>

257
00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:48.790
<v Speaker 1>forms unchanged for periods of up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>25,000</v>

258
00:15:48.791 --> 00:15:51.700
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the anthropological and archeological</v>

259
00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.940
<v Speaker 1>evidence is fairly clear on that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are very,</v>

260
00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:55.774
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old stories and people remember </v>

261
00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:58.814
<v Speaker 1>them and created them for reasons we </v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't understand and they're </v>

262
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.860
<v Speaker 1>strange and mysterious and unforgettable</v>
<v Speaker 1>all at the same time.</v>

263
00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.520
<v Speaker 1>The story of Adam and Eve as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell,</v>

264
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.090
<v Speaker 1>is the story of the coming of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

265
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.460
<v Speaker 1>the coming of self consciousness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind,</v>

266
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.620
<v Speaker 1>and I think that the human,</v>

267
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.943
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

268
00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.180
<v Speaker 1>the human human self consciousness is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what separates us from animals.</v>

269
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.153
<v Speaker 1>In Genesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an insistence that went out to </v>

270
00:16:31.471 --> 00:16:32.304
<v Speaker 1>meet the apple that eve offered to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scales fell from his eyes and the </v>

271
00:16:35.071 --> 00:16:37.470
<v Speaker 1>first thing that he realized was that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was naked.</v>

272
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.140
<v Speaker 1>And what that seems to me to mean is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

273
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:41.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it means first of all,</v>

274
00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:42.594
<v Speaker 1>that women make men self conscious and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's ample reason to presume </v>

275
00:16:45.931 --> 00:16:48.870
<v Speaker 1>that and there's good evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for suggesting why that might be</v>

276
00:16:48.871 --> 00:16:53.850
<v Speaker 1>the case because sexual selection among </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings has been a primary force of</v>

277
00:16:53.851 --> 00:16:54.684
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sexual selection in human beings is </v>

278
00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 1>primarily conducted by women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

279
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:06.270
<v Speaker 1>as Roy has pointed out in his address to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the APA a few years ago,</v>

280
00:17:06.271 --> 00:17:09.490
<v Speaker 1>and I hope I get this right twice as </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of your relatives who were women as</v>

281
00:17:09.491 --> 00:17:10.410
<v Speaker 1>well as men.</v>

282
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:11.423
<v Speaker 1>And that means that women are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently reproductively successful </v>

283
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.553
<v Speaker 1>than men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they reject most Matt and the </v>

284
00:17:19.021 --> 00:17:19.854
<v Speaker 1>rejection of a man for reproductive </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes by a woman is the most serious </v>

285
00:17:22.981 --> 00:17:23.814
<v Speaker 1>form of rejection that's possible from </v>
<v Speaker 1>an evolutionary point of view because </v>

286
00:17:26.341 --> 00:17:29.010
<v Speaker 1>the judgment is that what you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice enough to talk to,</v>

287
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:29.883
<v Speaker 1>whoever you're sure not fit to have your</v>
<v Speaker 1>genes propagate into the next </v>

288
00:17:32.221 --> 00:17:33.054
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's no wonder that women can make </v>

289
00:17:35.191 --> 00:17:37.020
<v Speaker 1>self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make men self conscious.</v>

290
00:17:37.021 --> 00:17:37.854
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's some reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>presume that it's the sexual selection </v>

291
00:17:40.681 --> 00:17:44.520
<v Speaker 1>forces that women placed upon man that </v>
<v Speaker 1>drove rapid human cortical evolution and</v>

292
00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:45.354
<v Speaker 1>the development of self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a leap and then there's no </v>

293
00:17:47.911 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 1>way I can justify that the course of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular talk.</v>

294
00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 1>But I think there is good reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>presume that it's the case in genesis.</v>

295
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:56.963
<v Speaker 1>Human beings become self conscious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens to them is </v>

296
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:00.024
<v Speaker 1>that they realized they they're naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing that happens to </v>

297
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:02.454
<v Speaker 1>them as they develop the moral sense to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the difference between good and </v>

298
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very strange thing because in</v>

299
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:09.270
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before our creature is self conscious,</v>

300
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>there is no distinction between good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil because as I said before,</v>

301
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.300
<v Speaker 1>a Predator is not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a predator.</v>

302
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.080
<v Speaker 1>The fact of a Predator like a wolf might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a tragedy for the rabbit,</v>

303
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:19.914
<v Speaker 1>but you can't be assuming that the wolf </v>
<v Speaker 1>is evil merely because it wants to eat </v>

304
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:23.124
<v Speaker 1>the rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with the dawning of self </v>

305
00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:28.470
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there there seems to be the emergence of</v>

306
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:29.304
<v Speaker 1>a moral sense that's essentially unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>to human beings and that has something </v>

307
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:36.900
<v Speaker 1>to do with our capacity to reflect upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mechanisms of our action.</v>

308
00:18:36.901 --> 00:18:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And then for some reason to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>modify those actions and to choose which</v>

309
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:43.020
<v Speaker 1>ones to implement into the future and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

310
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.973
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand that and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>even deny if you'd like that the the </v>

311
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:48.443
<v Speaker 1>phenomena of free choice exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But our culture is essentially </v>

312
00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the notion that it does </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

313
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 1>And in the absence of evidence that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

314
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:57.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take the easy way out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that it does.</v>

315
00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.033
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things fall apart and they fall apart </v>

316
00:19:00.241 --> 00:19:01.074
<v Speaker 1>badly</v>

317
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.293
<v Speaker 2>when</v>

318
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.050
<v Speaker 1>after Adam and eve become self </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>

319
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.480
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they do is closed </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and to me,</v>

320
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:10.314
<v Speaker 1>that's a mythological description of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>emergence of culture as an intercession </v>

321
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:15.414
<v Speaker 1>between the Ne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental vulnerability and </v>

322
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:20.610
<v Speaker 1>nakedness of the human form and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>depredations of nature.</v>

323
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.880
<v Speaker 1>If you realize that you're vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and prone to death,</v>

324
00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:24.714
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you're going to do is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start rearranging the manner in which </v>

325
00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:27.774
<v Speaker 1>you construe yourself so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect yourself from suction </v>

326
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.793
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think partly why God curses Adam </v>

327
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:35.880
<v Speaker 1>with the necessity of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once he finds out,</v>

328
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.430
<v Speaker 1>once God finds out that people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>become self conscious,</v>

329
00:19:38.431 --> 00:19:42.000
<v Speaker 1>like if you know that what's the winter </v>
<v Speaker 1>is lurking in the future,</v>

330
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:42.834
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to work and animals don't </v>

331
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:45.204
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just motivated to do whatever </v>

332
00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:47.004
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but humans work and that means they </v>

333
00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:48.834
<v Speaker 1>subvert their day to day motivations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their immediate motivations for the </v>

334
00:19:52.831 --> 00:19:56.490
<v Speaker 1>purposes of future security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a real cost to that.</v>

335
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.653
<v Speaker 1>Part of the cost is separation from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pure and unadulterated flow of animal </v>

336
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:02.784
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that people suffer from </v>

337
00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:08.841
<v Speaker 1>that absence of flow continually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

338
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.280
<v Speaker 1>and the advantage that they gained from </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that they can plan for the future,</v>

339
00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:14.114
<v Speaker 1>but the disadvantages that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculating and cold and separated from </v>

340
00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:18.530
<v Speaker 1>their own instinctual resources,</v>

341
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.331
<v Speaker 1>eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

342
00:20:22.331 --> 00:20:27.331
<v Speaker 1>is cursed by what's going to be terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain in childbirth and that's related to</v>

343
00:20:27.551 --> 00:20:28.384
<v Speaker 1>the development of the immense skull </v>
<v Speaker 1>size that characterizes human infants </v>

344
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.490
<v Speaker 1>and they're incredibly lengthy period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependence,</v>

345
00:20:36.491 --> 00:20:39.190
<v Speaker 1>which is also associated with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>immense spring</v>

346
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.640
<v Speaker 1>after Adam and eve become self </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

347
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.990
<v Speaker 1>They hide and this is actually a comical</v>
<v Speaker 1>of genesis.</v>

348
00:20:47.991 --> 00:20:50.600
<v Speaker 1>It's never really read as a comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is a comedy.</v>

349
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Even the fall itself as a comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're hiding away behind a Bush</v>

350
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.130
<v Speaker 1>and God comes to walking through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garden.</v>

351
00:20:58.131 --> 00:20:58.964
<v Speaker 1>And God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the infinite is accustomed to walking </v>

352
00:21:01.401 --> 00:21:06.320
<v Speaker 1>without him with no interruption of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flow of information between them.</v>

353
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Madame is narrowed and God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:11.900
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where have you gone?</v>

355
00:21:11.901 --> 00:21:12.860
<v Speaker 1>And Adam says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

356
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God says,</v>

357
00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.590
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of stupid really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why it's a common.</v>

358
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's hiding behind a bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is God,</v>

359
00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:21.124
<v Speaker 1>and he can see through bushes and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam should know that it doesn't really </v>

360
00:21:23.631 --> 00:21:25.220
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hiding out in this Bush anyways.</v>

361
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.470
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and got so Adam says,</v>

362
00:21:27.471 --> 00:21:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And God says,</v>

363
00:21:29.001 --> 00:21:29.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you know,</v>

364
00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.100
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you hiding?</v>

365
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Because Adam's ashamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Adam says,</v>

366
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:36.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm naked.</v>

367
00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.623
<v Speaker 1>And this is an example of the tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>compression of human wisdom into a few </v>

368
00:21:42.141 --> 00:21:44.150
<v Speaker 1>lines that characterizes mythologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

369
00:21:44.151 --> 00:21:46.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would people hide from God once they</v>

370
00:21:46.701 --> 00:21:48.410
<v Speaker 1>realized they're naked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>

371
00:21:48.411 --> 00:21:49.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty obvious.</v>

372
00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Once you know you're vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

373
00:21:52.281 --> 00:21:53.114
<v Speaker 1>Do you really have enough courage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest any sort of semblance of a </v>

374
00:21:55.641 --> 00:21:57.350
<v Speaker 1>divine destiny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

375
00:21:57.351 --> 00:21:59.240
<v Speaker 1>the answer that is pretty much clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

376
00:21:59.241 --> 00:22:00.074
<v Speaker 1>and it's no bloody wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the hiding is people hide when </v>

377
00:22:02.391 --> 00:22:04.050
<v Speaker 1>they're self conscious and vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

378
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Are they hide from them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hide from their deepest destiny and</v>

379
00:22:06.861 --> 00:22:09.260
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

380
00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:09.681
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

381
00:22:09.681 --> 00:22:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How that happened?</v>

382
00:22:11.361 --> 00:22:12.310
<v Speaker 1>And Adam says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mrs.</v>

383
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:13.303
<v Speaker 1>Carmen was the woman's fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is really funny in which </v>

384
00:22:15.531 --> 00:22:19.070
<v Speaker 1>actually may have been the original sin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not the eating of the apple,</v>

385
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:19.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

386
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.400
<v Speaker 1>The first time that the man blamed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman for his self conscious misery.</v>

387
00:22:25.551 --> 00:22:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the real fall and knock </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise of self consciousness itself.</v>

388
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we knew the rest of the story.</v>

389
00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.211
<v Speaker 1>God says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

390
00:22:32.211 --> 00:22:33.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cat's out of the bag.</v>

391
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're vulnerable and from here</v>

392
00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.720
<v Speaker 1>on in history starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out of paradise here,</v>

393
00:22:38.721 --> 00:22:41.300
<v Speaker 1>out of unconscious identification with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural world,</v>

394
00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.120
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna sweat.</v>

395
00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Lots of the time it isn't going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women,</v>

396
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.280
<v Speaker 1>they are going to be beholding to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>husbands,</v>

397
00:22:49.281 --> 00:22:53.750
<v Speaker 1>not because that's divine theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because the developmental,</v>

398
00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.453
<v Speaker 1>the developmental dependency of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human infant is so extreme that women </v>

399
00:22:58.251 --> 00:23:01.910
<v Speaker 1>are cursed to rely on men for protection</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're at their most vulnerable,</v>

400
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.513
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's self consciousness and an </v>

401
00:23:06.081 --> 00:23:09.050
<v Speaker 1>explanation for why people would hide </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from their destiny,</v>

402
00:23:09.051 --> 00:23:09.884
<v Speaker 1>but then the next story that can enable </v>
<v Speaker 1>story really elaborates that out and </v>

403
00:23:13.281 --> 00:23:14.930
<v Speaker 1>describes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so cain and Abel,</v>

404
00:23:14.931 --> 00:23:17.750
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our two sons of Adam and eve,</v>

405
00:23:17.751 --> 00:23:21.620
<v Speaker 1>and they're really the first people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course Adam and eve were made</v>

406
00:23:21.621 --> 00:23:22.454
<v Speaker 1>by God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're really not people at all </v>

407
00:23:23.391 --> 00:23:24.224
<v Speaker 1>because people are born and Cain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abel are the first two people and they </v>

408
00:23:28.521 --> 00:23:33.521
<v Speaker 1>characterize as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to canonical patterns of reaction to the</v>

409
00:23:33.831 --> 00:23:34.664
<v Speaker 1>terrible vulnerability that's revealed </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of the development of </v>

410
00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:42.701
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel make sacrifices to God.</v>

411
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:45.543
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

412
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Human cultures make sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>

413
00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Sacrifice sacrificial rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A human universal blood sacrifices.</v>

414
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.453
<v Speaker 1>A human universal human sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in some anthropological at was </v>

415
00:23:58.991 --> 00:24:03.190
<v Speaker 1>regarded as a human universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do people make sacrifices to God?</v>

416
00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.370
<v Speaker 1>To please him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a mystery to modern people.</v>

417
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:07.983
<v Speaker 1>I ask my students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sacrifices did you make to go to </v>

418
00:24:10.121 --> 00:24:12.670
<v Speaker 1>university?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they can answer that in two tenths</v>

419
00:24:12.671 --> 00:24:13.504
<v Speaker 1>of a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't party as much as they might </v>

420
00:24:15.361 --> 00:24:15.770
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>

421
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.750
<v Speaker 1>They can't drink nearly as much beer as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they might've liked to more seriously.</v>

422
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.870
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them have put their families in</v>

423
00:24:22.871 --> 00:24:23.704
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in serious financial straits to send </v>

424
00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:26.374
<v Speaker 1>them to university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've given up all sorts of things in </v>

425
00:24:29.171 --> 00:24:30.004
<v Speaker 1>order to pursue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue a course of action that they </v>

426
00:24:31.301 --> 00:24:32.134
<v Speaker 1>believe will best ensure they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>harmonious relationship with the nature </v>

427
00:24:35.081 --> 00:24:37.450
<v Speaker 1>of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone makes sacrifices.</v>

428
00:24:37.451 --> 00:24:38.284
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can say that now because we're a </v>

429
00:24:39.551 --> 00:24:42.400
<v Speaker 1>psychologically sophisticated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistically sophisticated.</v>

430
00:24:42.401 --> 00:24:44.200
<v Speaker 1>We know something about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

431
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.393
<v Speaker 1>but thousands and thousands of years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>before people had this explicit </v>

432
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:48.694
<v Speaker 1>psychological acumen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best they could do is act out and </v>

433
00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:51.874
<v Speaker 1>tell stories about human psychology </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they hadn't developed any </v>

434
00:24:54.131 --> 00:24:54.964
<v Speaker 1>further than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cain and Abel is one of those </v>

435
00:24:56.471 --> 00:24:57.304
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

436
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.190
<v Speaker 1>The sacrifices are burnt on an altar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

437
00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smoke rises well,</v>

438
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.273
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well go ends up in the sky and if the </v>

439
00:25:06.991 --> 00:25:08.820
<v Speaker 1>smoke rises up there and he gets a whiff</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

440
00:25:08.821 --> 00:25:09.654
<v Speaker 1>he can tell what the quality of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice was and you can laugh about </v>

441
00:25:12.241 --> 00:25:15.180
<v Speaker 1>that and you can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about a desk primitive,</v>

442
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:16.014
<v Speaker 1>but it's not permitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's artistic and it's beautiful and </v>

443
00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:18.900
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's accurate.</v>

444
00:25:18.901 --> 00:25:19.734
<v Speaker 1>And here's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because before the invention of the </v>

445
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.170
<v Speaker 1>electrical light and maybe before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>invention of fire,</v>

446
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:28.913
<v Speaker 1>the closest to human being could ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>give to direct confrontation with the </v>

447
00:25:31.831 --> 00:25:32.664
<v Speaker 1>absolute unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to look up at the night sky because </v>

448
00:25:34.891 --> 00:25:35.724
<v Speaker 1>the night story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it sprinkled with stars </v>

449
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.243
<v Speaker 1>confronts you directly with the fact of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the infinite and to make the </v>

450
00:25:41.191 --> 00:25:42.024
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that God resides in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>incident and you're having a direct </v>

451
00:25:45.151 --> 00:25:48.630
<v Speaker 1>experience of the infinite at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment is not a primitive notion.</v>

452
00:25:48.631 --> 00:25:49.464
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very intelligent and creative </v>

453
00:25:52.111 --> 00:25:52.944
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the notion that God occupies the </v>

454
00:25:54.691 --> 00:25:57.120
<v Speaker 1>sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the days guy being equally as impressive</v>

455
00:25:57.121 --> 00:25:59.640
<v Speaker 1>as the night sky is not a primitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis.</v>

456
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:03.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a reflection of the nature of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of human experience.</v>

457
00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.090
<v Speaker 1>You burn something and you send the </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke up.</v>

458
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.900
<v Speaker 1>God gets a crack at determining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of your offering,</v>

459
00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:11.970
<v Speaker 1>the quality of your sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

460
00:26:11.971 --> 00:26:14.760
<v Speaker 1>let's get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be perfectly clear about this.</v>

461
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:19.200
<v Speaker 1>If your sacrifices aren't first grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of your relationship with the</v>

462
00:26:19.201 --> 00:26:20.034
<v Speaker 1>infinite is going to suffer dreadfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what the story of </v>

463
00:26:22.861 --> 00:26:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel reveals now able.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's interesting character.</v>

464
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.433
<v Speaker 1>He believes in the nature of experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the nature of existence when he's </v>

465
00:26:30.871 --> 00:26:31.704
<v Speaker 1>called on to make a sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sacrifices the best that he has to </v>

466
00:26:34.201 --> 00:26:36.930
<v Speaker 1>offer and that makes God happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence,</v>

467
00:26:36.931 --> 00:26:39.180
<v Speaker 1>everything that Abel touches turns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gold.</v>

468
00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Everyone likes him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they respect him,</v>

469
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.530
<v Speaker 1>his crops multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's successful women.</v>

470
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.513
<v Speaker 1>Plus he's a wonderful guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could hardly imagine a more </v>

471
00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:49.650
<v Speaker 1>annoying creature if you possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempted to do it.</v>

472
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:50.484
<v Speaker 1>Whereas cain see cain has reacted to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness by withdrawing from </v>

473
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:56.604
<v Speaker 1>the infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a tremendous danger in that </v>

474
00:26:58.231 --> 00:26:59.064
<v Speaker 1>because it starts to mean that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized purely on his own devious </v>

475
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:07.140
<v Speaker 1>devices to sale is shipped through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders of life.</v>

476
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.593
<v Speaker 1>He believes as his arrogance developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of his withdrawal from </v>

477
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:14.214
<v Speaker 1>the infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the contact that he can't tolerate </v>

478
00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 1>because he can't tolerate his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

479
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 1>That he's able to deceive the structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality itself,</v>

480
00:27:20.941 --> 00:27:21.774
<v Speaker 1>to offer second rate sacrifices to God </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself who can see absolutely </v>

481
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:29.820
<v Speaker 1>everything because the infinite is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything and to prevail.</v>

482
00:27:29.821 --> 00:27:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

483
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.943
<v Speaker 1>needless to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this does not work and it doesn't work </v>

484
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 1>in an obvious way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you talk to people and they reveal to</v>

485
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:43.530
<v Speaker 1>you they're unnecessary suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very straightforward to look behind</v>

486
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:47.880
<v Speaker 1>what it is that they have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell you the poor decisions they</v>

487
00:27:47.881 --> 00:27:48.714
<v Speaker 1>made in their lives and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities that they didn't take and </v>

488
00:27:50.551 --> 00:27:54.540
<v Speaker 1>the chances that they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have enough courage to grasp</v>

489
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:55.374
<v Speaker 1>and the sacrifices they failed to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing mysterious about it and </v>

490
00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.693
<v Speaker 1>their own experiences teach them full </v>
<v Speaker 1>well that they pathologize the </v>

491
00:28:02.551 --> 00:28:04.800
<v Speaker 1>relationship they have with the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality.</v>

492
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible thing.</v>

493
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.903
<v Speaker 1>Well in Kane is dreadfully unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's unhappy because nothing he ever </v>

494
00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:11.544
<v Speaker 1>wants happens and that's partly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't really want it because if he </v>

495
00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:14.604
<v Speaker 1>really wanted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd make the right sacrifices to salt </v>

496
00:28:16.891 --> 00:28:17.724
<v Speaker 1>is rubbed into his wounds by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence of his brother for whom </v>

497
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:22.860
<v Speaker 1>everything seemed simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course really isn't.</v>

498
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:24.143
<v Speaker 1>Cane goes to complain to God and I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to read three or four different </v>

499
00:28:27.601 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 1>translations of these particular verses </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what this meant.</v>

500
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Penny says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the world is going on here?</v>

501
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm marketing myself to the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sacrificing things left,</v>

502
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:41.880
<v Speaker 1>right and center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything I touch turns to dirt.</v>

503
00:28:41.881 --> 00:28:46.881
<v Speaker 1>Everything turns against me like what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with the nature of reality canes?</v>

504
00:28:47.271 --> 00:28:52.271
<v Speaker 1>Essential vulnerability is revealed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exacerbated by his pathological attitude</v>

505
00:28:53.221 --> 00:28:55.530
<v Speaker 1>towards his own actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God says to him,</v>

506
00:28:55.531 --> 00:29:00.531
<v Speaker 1>essentially sin is a predatory cat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>crouches at your doorway and leaps on us</v>

507
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 1>will it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you only wanted to,</v>

508
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:05.214
<v Speaker 1>you could master it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is absolutely the last thing </v>

509
00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:09.714
<v Speaker 1>that Kayden wants to hear because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are going from bad to worse for </v>

510
00:29:13.171 --> 00:29:15.750
<v Speaker 1>you and you're playing a causal role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

511
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.950
<v Speaker 1>there is nothing more horrible than some</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone can do to you,</v>

512
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:21.023
<v Speaker 1>but reveal to you in a way that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>deny that you're entirely complicit in </v>

513
00:29:24.481 --> 00:29:27.990
<v Speaker 1>your own demise and that's exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 1>God does to cane,</v>

514
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.550
<v Speaker 1>and so what is can do?</v>

515
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.153
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logical thing would be listened </v>

516
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:36.300
<v Speaker 1>because if the structure of reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself tells you something,</v>

517
00:29:36.301 --> 00:29:38.340
<v Speaker 1>it's best to listen since there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>way out of it,</v>

518
00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:39.174
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what kin does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so incensed by his essential </v>

519
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:43.804
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compromised and exacerbated by his </v>

520
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:48.690
<v Speaker 1>failure to make the appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices in,</v>

521
00:29:48.691 --> 00:29:51.340
<v Speaker 1>to conduct himself appropriately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he decides that in there,</v>

522
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.920
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to destroy his ideal,</v>

523
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.023
<v Speaker 1>to reduce the tension that he feels when</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ideal exists as a contrast point </v>

524
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.510
<v Speaker 1>and number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to destroy the favorite son of God,</v>

525
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.860
<v Speaker 1>and so he goes out into the field and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kills Abel and God comes along and says,</v>

526
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.080
<v Speaker 1>where's my favorite Sonnen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain says,</v>

527
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I killed him and it's so interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that that story is placed.</v>

528
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Really it's the third story in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament.</v>

529
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.990
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's with the archaic stories and it's a</v>

530
00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:23.830
<v Speaker 1>story that reveals as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are two essential patterns of</v>

531
00:30:23.831 --> 00:30:28.240
<v Speaker 1>reaction to the self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable conditions of existence,</v>

532
00:30:28.241 --> 00:30:33.241
<v Speaker 1>and one is humble approach to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinity with determined attempt to make</v>

533
00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 1>the appropriate sacrifices.</v>

534
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 1>The other is arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment,</v>

535
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.620
<v Speaker 1>the keeping of everything good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>oneself and the degeneration of the soul</v>

536
00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 1>into something that's homicidally </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous.</v>

537
00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story doesn't stop there and it gets</v>

538
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:50.680
<v Speaker 1>really compressed in this part and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's perhaps because some of it's been</v>

539
00:30:50.681 --> 00:30:53.800
<v Speaker 1>lost with the passages of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the next thing that happens is that,</v>

540
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:58.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God doesn't punish cane anything.</v>

541
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 1>That's Kinda strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Old Testament God,</v>

542
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:03.100
<v Speaker 1>he's punishing people left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

543
00:31:03.101 --> 00:31:03.911
<v Speaker 1>and center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

544
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Why not cane and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

545
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.323
<v Speaker 1>he marks cane and he says to the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are around that they should leave </v>

546
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:13.960
<v Speaker 1>him alone because he's been marked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>God as to be left alone.</v>

547
00:31:13.961 --> 00:31:14.794
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that's reflected </v>

548
00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:17.944
<v Speaker 1>on our legal system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that murder promotes revenge and </v>

549
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Speaker 1>revenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy societies,</v>

550
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.083
<v Speaker 1>and so God puts an end to the situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there and then by telling people </v>

551
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:32.611
<v Speaker 1>that despite the fact that cane has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has committed a terrible crime,</v>

552
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.433
<v Speaker 1>that there will be no retribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cannon goes off and gets married and he </v>

553
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:44.980
<v Speaker 1>has a number of generations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>offspring.</v>

554
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.760
<v Speaker 1>If you insult a member of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of keynes offspring,</v>

555
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.580
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It killed seven of you.</v>

556
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And if you insult a member of the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of Keynes offspring,</v>

557
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.930
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't kill seven of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he killed seven times,</v>

558
00:32:01.931 --> 00:32:02.764
<v Speaker 1>seven of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on down the rate down the road </v>

559
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:11.700
<v Speaker 1>of the offspring of Cain is tubilcain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tubilcain is the artificer of weapons of</v>

560
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:19.441
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this stunningly brilliant story says</v>

561
00:32:19.661 --> 00:32:20.494
<v Speaker 1>in it's incredibly compressed fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the motivation that drives the </v>

562
00:32:25.611 --> 00:32:29.620
<v Speaker 1>commission of the worst human atrocities</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't inevitable.</v>

563
00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:30.454
<v Speaker 1>Social consequence of the refusal of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>self conscious individual to make the </v>

564
00:32:34.931 --> 00:32:35.764
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices appropriate to establishing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmonious life and there consequent </v>

565
00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:40.773
<v Speaker 1>degeneration into a kind of murderous </v>
<v Speaker 1>and resentment filled raged rage </v>

566
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.793
<v Speaker 1>propagating endlessly through its </v>
<v Speaker 1>variations in society until everything </v>

567
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:55.400
<v Speaker 1>comes to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next story is the flood.</v>

568
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's not surprising because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>things go from bad to worse,</v>

569
00:33:01.431 --> 00:33:04.190
<v Speaker 1>long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything falls.</v>

570
00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's a terrifying story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't understand that story.</v>

571
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand that story for </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

572
00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:12.340
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really until I read Aleksandr </v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn that,</v>

573
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.120
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I develop,</v>

574
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.870
<v Speaker 1>I think the cognitive capacity to even </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what the story meant.</v>

575
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:21.440
<v Speaker 1>Because Solzhenitsyn said in his Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prize accepting speech,</v>

576
00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.800
<v Speaker 1>a single person who stopped lying can </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring down a tyranny,</v>

577
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.113
<v Speaker 1>which is a stunning thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would also say something that's </v>

578
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:31.000
<v Speaker 1>been amply demonstrated in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century because we have the.</v>

579
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 1>We have historical examples of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who did precisely that.</v>

580
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Got Them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it in fact,</v>

581
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how well did it Nelson Mandela did it,</v>

582
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:39.223
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn's gulag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archipelago was definitely one of the </v>

583
00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:42.704
<v Speaker 1>acs blows that brought down the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union a stunning achievement for a </v>

584
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:46.514
<v Speaker 1>person who started writing that book by </v>
<v Speaker 1>memorizing it when he was a </v>

585
00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:51.950
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp victim this far away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from starvation.</v>

586
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.280
<v Speaker 1>It shows you as clearly as anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can,</v>

587
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.323
<v Speaker 1>how powerful the human spirit can be if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's willing to take on the obligation </v>

588
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:04.280
<v Speaker 1>of its relationship with the divine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also how terrible things can become.</v>

589
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.130
<v Speaker 1>If the responsibility of that burden is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not children.</v>

590
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Now it's no wonder as far as I can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people don't think this way because</v>

591
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.093
<v Speaker 1>thinking this way is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's catastrophic in a way because the </v>

592
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:16.364
<v Speaker 1>burden it places on the individual is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme that it's almost unbearable </v>

593
00:34:19.071 --> 00:34:19.630
<v Speaker 1>while in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

594
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:20.463
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's exactly why it is in genesis </v>

595
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:24.020
<v Speaker 1>to begin with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam hides.</v>

596
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.080
<v Speaker 1>He becomes conscious of his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

597
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:28.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

598
00:34:28.091 --> 00:34:30.590
<v Speaker 1>a creature such as I could never bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a burden.</v>

599
00:34:30.591 --> 00:34:31.424
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more to people than meets </v>

600
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:33.464
<v Speaker 1>the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way I learned that was by </v>

601
00:34:35.121 --> 00:34:35.954
<v Speaker 1>looking at people's and my own peoples </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my own capacity for evil because I </v>

602
00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:39.764
<v Speaker 1>started to realize that we regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves as narrow little beings in a </v>

603
00:34:42.771 --> 00:34:44.090
<v Speaker 1>particular kind of box.</v>

604
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.120
<v Speaker 1>And there's real comfort in that older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tremendous limitation.</v>

605
00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:49.940
<v Speaker 1>You cannot see your way out of that box </v>
<v Speaker 1>until,</v>

606
00:34:49.941 --> 00:34:50.774
<v Speaker 1>you know what I teach my students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I teach them about Nazi Germany and I </v>

607
00:34:54.111 --> 00:34:57.950
<v Speaker 1>try to make them understand that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an overwhelming probability if they were</v>

608
00:34:57.951 --> 00:35:01.040
<v Speaker 1>in Nazi Germany in the 19 thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would've been perpetrators and</v>

609
00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:01.874
<v Speaker 1>Nazis and overwhelming probability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they can't accept that because </v>

610
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:06.044
<v Speaker 1>it's a historical fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have absolutely no idea who they </v>

611
00:35:08.061 --> 00:35:08.894
<v Speaker 1>are now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagining yourself as a Nazi </v>

612
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:13.820
<v Speaker 1>perpetrators an unbearably terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do,</v>

613
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:14.923
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe that you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that you have any insight </v>

614
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:18.344
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever into your capacity for good </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you have some well-developed </v>

615
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:22.933
<v Speaker 1>insight into your capacity for evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people can tell you until </v>

616
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:27.800
<v Speaker 1>they're blue in the face about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for good.</v>

617
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:28.910
<v Speaker 1>It just sounds like a.</v>

618
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.493
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like wishful thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like this sort of thing that </v>

619
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:32.924
<v Speaker 1>an advertiser might tell you on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too good to be true and I </v>

620
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:40.440
<v Speaker 1>don't think believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that if you tell people that</v>

621
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 1>you know in a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark corners of their mind,</v>

622
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 1>there are motivations that are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible that they would.</v>

623
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.093
<v Speaker 1>They would traumatize themselves if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were ever revealed that everyone knows </v>

624
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.520
<v Speaker 1>at some level of analysis that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely true.</v>

625
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.380
<v Speaker 1>You think there's evidence throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>history that it's possible for people to</v>

626
00:35:58.381 --> 00:35:59.214
<v Speaker 1>be enlightened and you would think since</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment is viewed as the </v>

627
00:36:04.531 --> 00:36:05.364
<v Speaker 1>medication for vulnerability in death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody would be struggling as </v>

628
00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:09.414
<v Speaker 1>hard as they possibly could to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened if such a state exactly and </v>

629
00:36:12.631 --> 00:36:13.464
<v Speaker 1>precisely exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the barrier to enlightenment is </v>

630
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:19.880
<v Speaker 1>the development of self consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the individual humans,</v>

631
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.143
<v Speaker 1>infinite capacity for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can be immediately convinced </v>

632
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.770
<v Speaker 1>about why enlightenment is in such short</v>
<v Speaker 1>supply.</v>

633
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:30.803
<v Speaker 1>When I</v>

634
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.273
<v Speaker 1>finished my first provisional </v>
<v Speaker 1>examination of the sorts of motivations </v>

635
00:36:35.861 --> 00:36:36.694
<v Speaker 1>that drove people to set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps and to torture </v>

636
00:36:39.941 --> 00:36:44.110
<v Speaker 1>people terribly and those camps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came to a terrible conclusion,</v>

637
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.233
<v Speaker 1>a conclusion that I think in some ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the worst thing that had ever </v>

638
00:36:48.941 --> 00:36:50.890
<v Speaker 1>happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe intellectually and morally.</v>

639
00:36:50.891 --> 00:36:51.724
<v Speaker 1>I thought I came to understand why it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people depended on their group </v>

640
00:36:55.631 --> 00:36:56.464
<v Speaker 1>identity and their cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>identification because that helped </v>

641
00:36:58.421 --> 00:37:00.790
<v Speaker 1>protect themselves from their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

642
00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.640
<v Speaker 1>You have to believe things because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't know everything,</v>

643
00:37:03.641 --> 00:37:05.980
<v Speaker 1>so you have to believe things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fill in the gaps to bleach,</v>

644
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.980
<v Speaker 1>fill in the gaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the beliefs are stripped from you,</v>

645
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:09.873
<v Speaker 1>then your defenses against the infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>are stripped and it's no wonder that </v>

646
00:37:12.281 --> 00:37:16.730
<v Speaker 1>people will defend their beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

647
00:37:16.731 --> 00:37:19.310
<v Speaker 1>well you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're too involved in defending your</v>

648
00:37:19.311 --> 00:37:21.200
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be willing to kill other</v>

649
00:37:21.201 --> 00:37:24.380
<v Speaker 1>people in their defense and we're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologically powerful now that we can</v>

650
00:37:24.381 --> 00:37:27.830
<v Speaker 1>no longer be willing to kill other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the defense of our own beliefs</v>

651
00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:32.570
<v Speaker 1>because the time for that is passed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized,</v>

652
00:37:32.571 --> 00:37:34.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't stand up for your beliefs,</v>

653
00:37:34.431 --> 00:37:37.640
<v Speaker 1>you leave yourself open to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>depredations of the infinite.</v>

654
00:37:37.641 --> 00:37:41.420
<v Speaker 1>That's equally intolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to leave no way out.</v>

655
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.370
<v Speaker 1>There is a way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

656
00:37:45.371 --> 00:37:49.360
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's the way out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely religious people have tried to</v>

657
00:37:49.361 --> 00:37:50.194
<v Speaker 1>offer humanity for thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years and the way out of </v>

658
00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:59.070
<v Speaker 1>the conundrum posed to you by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliance on ideological beliefs and your</v>

659
00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:04.540
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability in the face of the unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the development of a truly integrated</v>

660
00:38:04.541 --> 00:38:08.710
<v Speaker 1>and powerful character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a individual development.</v>

661
00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:13.510
<v Speaker 1>And it means constant confrontation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't understand and constant</v>

662
00:38:13.511 --> 00:38:18.511
<v Speaker 1>attempts to ensure that your character </v>
<v Speaker 1>is composed of truth and solidity rather</v>

663
00:38:18.821 --> 00:38:23.350
<v Speaker 1>than deceit and to make of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's built on a rock and not</v>

664
00:38:23.351 --> 00:38:25.150
<v Speaker 1>predicated on sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>

665
00:38:25.151 --> 00:38:25.984
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to tell people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because maybe they should take care of </v>

666
00:38:28.721 --> 00:38:29.554
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if that's enough to </v>

667
00:38:31.271 --> 00:38:34.030
<v Speaker 1>tell people because they don't take care</v>
<v Speaker 1>of themselves that well.</v>

668
00:38:34.031 --> 00:38:35.960
<v Speaker 1>But it's a completely other thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

669
00:38:35.961 --> 00:38:36.794
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

670
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:39.410
<v Speaker 1>every time you make a pathological moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>

671
00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.310
<v Speaker 1>you move the one world one step closer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to complete annihilation.</v>

672
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:44.533
<v Speaker 1>And I absolutely believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the historical evidence is </v>

673
00:38:47.841 --> 00:38:48.674
<v Speaker 1>crystal clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that every time you </v>

674
00:38:51.021 --> 00:38:51.854
<v Speaker 1>make an appropriate moral decision and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you manifest moral courage in the face </v>

675
00:38:54.591 --> 00:38:57.800
<v Speaker 1>of your own vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you move the world one step farther</v>

676
00:38:57.801 --> 00:38:58.634
<v Speaker 1>from the break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every that's the case for every </v>

677
00:39:01.281 --> 00:39:02.730
<v Speaker 1>single person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

678
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:03.583
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing on his eastern Orthodox </v>

679
00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Christian background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single person is the center of the</v>

680
00:39:09.501 --> 00:39:13.190
<v Speaker 1>world as center of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the center of the world.</v>

681
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.550
<v Speaker 1>The world's a complicated place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can have all sorts of centers.</v>

682
00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.710
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to believe that you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>

683
00:39:18.711 --> 00:39:22.310
<v Speaker 1>but everything about human existence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to believe.</v>

684
00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.950
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's here at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to believe the nature of.</v>

685
00:39:24.951 --> 00:39:27.920
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to believe everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings does.</v>

686
00:39:27.921 --> 00:39:28.754
<v Speaker 1>It's so ridiculous and remarkable that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a consistently and </v>

687
00:39:32.391 --> 00:39:33.224
<v Speaker 1>constantly unfolding miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that each of you might be a </v>

688
00:39:35.991 --> 00:39:36.824
<v Speaker 1>center of the cosmos in that infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>admixture of ridiculousness and now </v>

689
00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:46.850
<v Speaker 1>absurdities is hardly more than one more</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous thing to swallow.</v>

690
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll summarize,</v>

691
00:39:49.231 --> 00:39:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I guess said that tragedy is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precondition for being.</v>

692
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Being is the interplay between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>finite and the infinite,</v>

693
00:39:58.571 --> 00:40:00.060
<v Speaker 1>and in that interplay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's tragedy.</v>

694
00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:04.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no way out of that evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>something different evils.</v>

695
00:40:04.781 --> 00:40:05.614
<v Speaker 1>The conscious attempt to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of existence more </v>

696
00:40:07.541 --> 00:40:11.800
<v Speaker 1>pathological than they have to be and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's motivated by conscious intent.</v>

697
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:13.563
<v Speaker 1>The motivations arise because people pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>a terrible price for their self </v>

698
00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:17.814
<v Speaker 1>conscious awareness and that awareness </v>
<v Speaker 1>is there awareness of their </v>

699
00:40:19.841 --> 00:40:23.110
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability and that is a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to be aware of.</v>

700
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:31.010
<v Speaker 1>That vulnerability can be confronted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forthrightly accepted,</v>

701
00:40:31.011 --> 00:40:33.230
<v Speaker 1>and the appropriate decisions made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alternatively,</v>

702
00:40:33.231 --> 00:40:34.064
<v Speaker 1>people can retreat into their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalistic arrogance and attempt to </v>

703
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:39.763
<v Speaker 1>deceive themselves and everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the nature of their own existence </v>

704
00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:43.334
<v Speaker 1>and about the nature of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That pathway leads to nothing but </v>

705
00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:46.754
<v Speaker 1>destruction.</v>

706
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:50.763
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's good reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that it's too late in the day in </v>

707
00:40:53.741 --> 00:40:54.574
<v Speaker 1>our developmental course as a species </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that path to be acceptable anymore </v>

708
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.420
<v Speaker 1>because we're too powerful and if too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people stay on that path,</v>

709
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.433
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do ourselves in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say as we've become more </v>

710
00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:07.174
<v Speaker 1>technologically powerful and increasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral burden is being placed on each of </v>

711
00:41:10.451 --> 00:41:13.090
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It matters to the,</v>

712
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.480
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the destiny of the cosmos.</v>

713
00:41:16.481 --> 00:41:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not you get your moral act </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>

714
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:19.623
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean that in a trivial way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that's as close to an </v>

715
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:24.880
<v Speaker 1>empirical fact is anything that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated,</v>

716
00:41:24.881 --> 00:41:25.714
<v Speaker 1>and I also believe that's as terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing to consider as anything you </v>

717
00:41:27.731 --> 00:41:30.880
<v Speaker 1>could possibly imagine and maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much to ask of people,</v>

718
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.433
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our great religious traditions do </v>

719
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 1>continually remind us that insight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every human being,</v>

720
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:37.544
<v Speaker 1>there's a spark of divinity and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea is a precondition for our entire </v>

721
00:41:41.961 --> 00:41:46.440
<v Speaker 1>system of law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always the possibility that it's</v>

722
00:41:46.441 --> 00:41:49.830
<v Speaker 1>true and if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that there is a.</v>

723
00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:50.723
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infant and avenue of </v>

724
00:41:52.771 --> 00:41:57.771
<v Speaker 1>potential that lays open to every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>person and that the ability to transform</v>

725
00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:03.240
<v Speaker 1>the terrible conditions of reality into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something not only acceptable but worthy</v>

726
00:42:03.241 --> 00:42:04.074
<v Speaker 1>of celebration actually lies within our </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasp and the alternative that the </v>

727
00:42:08.431 --> 00:42:09.264
<v Speaker 1>alternative to that is the continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of a kind of held that so </v>

728
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:19.460
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensibly awful that by any </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable person's standards,</v>

729
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.880
<v Speaker 1>it has to be regarded as something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid.</v>

730
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.180
<v Speaker 1>That's all I have to say about that.</v>

731
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:35.060
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
