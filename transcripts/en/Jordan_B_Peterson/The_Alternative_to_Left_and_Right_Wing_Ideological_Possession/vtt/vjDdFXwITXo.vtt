00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.233
<v Speaker 1>Since the scientific age began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've lived in a universe where the </v>

2
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.530
<v Speaker 1>bottom strata of reality is considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be something that's dead like dirt.</v>

3
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's objective,</v>

4
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.613
<v Speaker 1>it's external and there isn't any </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of it that lens any reality to </v>

5
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.253
<v Speaker 1>phenomena like meaning or purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all been relegated to this </v>

6
00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>objective and in some ways to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>illusory,</v>

7
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.683
<v Speaker 1>but it's by no means self evident that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that set of presuppositions is correct </v>

8
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.033
<v Speaker 1>because we lack infinite knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's many things about the structure </v>

9
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>of being that we don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>main one being consciousness.</v>

10
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>We can't account for it at all and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't account for the role it appears to</v>

11
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>play in the transformation of potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>into actuality,</v>

12
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>which is a role that's been recognized </v>
<v Speaker 1>by physicists for almost a hundred years</v>

13
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>now and which remains one of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>unsolved mysteries in science.</v>

14
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.243
<v Speaker 1>There are other ways of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's real and these other ways have </v>

15
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:24.594
<v Speaker 1>some advantages and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages they have is that they </v>

16
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>protect us knowing these other ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>of operating within reality,</v>

17
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:31.374
<v Speaker 1>defining reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect us from certain kinds of </v>

18
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>pathologies.</v>

19
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>And modern people are prone to a fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of pathologies that stem from the</v>

20
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>assumptions of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their,</v>

21
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>of the systems they use to define </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

22
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>And one of those pathologies is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.243
<v Speaker 1>a kind of a nihilistic hopelessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a consequence of the </v>

24
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>recognition that in the final analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing really has any meaning.</v>

25
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.583
<v Speaker 1>And because life is difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a meaning that you can't </v>

26
00:01:57.391 --> 00:01:58.224
<v Speaker 1>escape being forced to abandon your </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief in a positive or a transcendent </v>

27
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:03.624
<v Speaker 1>meaning can leave you week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Times when you really can least </v>

28
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:07.434
<v Speaker 1>afford to be weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's more important pathologies </v>

29
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>that it's opened us up to two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are pathologies that belief.</v>

30
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think we saw the most horrifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of that.</v>

31
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.124
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully the most horrifying examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 20th century where people whose </v>

32
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:20.814
<v Speaker 1>belief systems were shattered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part by the competition </v>

33
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:24.564
<v Speaker 1>between religious and scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoints turned in large numbers to </v>

34
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>mass movements that were in error in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every way a substitute,</v>

35
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:33.144
<v Speaker 1>a moral rational in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>substitute for religious beliefs that </v>

36
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:37.524
<v Speaker 1>appeared no longer tenable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that was it was </v>

37
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>just about annihilation because we came </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to an isolation twice,</v>

38
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:45.204
<v Speaker 1>once in the 60s and once in the 80s and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even without the totality of </v>

39
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:49.974
<v Speaker 1>annihilation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lost hundreds of millions of people </v>

40
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of pathological belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and the 20th century.</v>
