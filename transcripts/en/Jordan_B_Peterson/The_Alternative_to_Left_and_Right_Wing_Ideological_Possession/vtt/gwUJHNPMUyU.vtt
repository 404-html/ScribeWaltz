1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.513
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this selectors called virtue as a </v>

2
00:00:02.641 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>

3
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.623
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

4
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.873
<v Speaker 1>the reason I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave it that title is because Virtue </v>

5
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality isn't a field of study.</v>

6
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a mode of being upon which all </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields of study rest.</v>

7
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>It's also a mode of being on which </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you do in your life rests the</v>

8
00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:26.674
<v Speaker 1>way you understand yourself or fail to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you understand other people or </v>

9
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:35.101
<v Speaker 1>fail to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And more deeply than not what role it is</v>

10
00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:39.970
<v Speaker 1>that you play in your life in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I've learned,</v>

11
00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:40.804
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a clinical psychologist who spent </v>

12
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.090
<v Speaker 1>thousands of hours helping people sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>out difficult problems,</v>

13
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:46.924
<v Speaker 1>is that lack of virtue makes people ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that my clients </v>

14
00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:53.134
<v Speaker 1>themselves lack virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose some of them do and some of </v>

15
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:56.494
<v Speaker 1>them don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to the degree that they're embedded </v>

16
00:00:57.821 --> 00:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>in a network of relationships where </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue is fundamentally absent,</v>

17
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.933
<v Speaker 1>they're tortured and tormented and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're unable to find firm ground and </v>

18
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.550
<v Speaker 1>that's not a biological problem.</v>

19
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Even though biologically fragile people </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be hurt more by a lack of virtue.</v>

20
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.570
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what you do in a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with people,</v>

21
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 1>and at least to some degree of clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship is supposed to be real,</v>

22
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>is provide a forum where people tell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

23
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard because people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to tell the truth.</v>

24
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Particular the truth is difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult for a variety of reasons.</v>

25
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.230
<v Speaker 1>So when I first thought about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture,</v>

26
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.123
<v Speaker 1>I had a slightly different title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The title was virtue as an existential </v>

27
00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:42.250
<v Speaker 1>necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a bit philosophical.</v>

28
00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:45.940
<v Speaker 1>So I modified it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a reason for that because</v>

29
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>the concept of virtue means to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtuous and existentialism is the study</v>

30
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.064
<v Speaker 1>of being right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that you can't really </v>

31
00:01:55.081 --> 00:02:00.081
<v Speaker 1>understand what makes up virtue until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you modulator modify your notion of what</v>

32
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:05.430
<v Speaker 1>constitutes being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a hard thing to do.</v>

33
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.403
<v Speaker 1>Modern people are fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>materialistic and there's some utility </v>

34
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:11.934
<v Speaker 1>in that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're masters of material </v>

35
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:14.214
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that we're materialist in </v>

36
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 1>our scientific philosophies has made us </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely powerful,</v>

37
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.473
<v Speaker 1>maybe too powerful for our morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely powerful from a technological </v>

38
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's blinded as to certain things.</v>

39
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.043
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the things that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really blinded us to is the nature of </v>

40
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:31.854
<v Speaker 1>our own being because we make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that the fundamental </v>

41
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>constituent elements of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our material,</v>

42
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.713
<v Speaker 1>we fail to notice that the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituent elements of our own reality </v>

43
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>are not material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're emotional,</v>

44
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>they're motivational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their dreams,</v>

45
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 1>their visions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their relationships with other people.</v>

46
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.623
<v Speaker 1>They're conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dependent on consciousness and </v>

47
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:54.714
<v Speaker 1>self consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have absolutely no materialist </v>

48
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:58.074
<v Speaker 1>explanation whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either for consciousness or self </v>

49
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.024
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't deal well from a </v>

50
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>materialistic perspective with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities of being.</v>

51
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>And everyone knows those qualities </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

52
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people,</v>

53
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more real than their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

54
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.623
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pain transcends rational argument in </v>

55
00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:20.301
<v Speaker 1>that you can't argue yourself out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just there and materialist or not.</v>

56
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>There's very few people that are willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to allow their,</v>

57
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>the claim that their pain is merely a </v>
<v Speaker 1>napa phenomenal episode.</v>

58
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Nomina of some more fundamental material</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

59
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Pain is fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness is fundamental,</v>

60
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.873
<v Speaker 1>and I think that unless you understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't think properly about </v>

61
00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:38.754
<v Speaker 1>virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I might start the discussion of </v>

62
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:44.210
<v Speaker 1>virtue with a discussion of Ba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.030
<v Speaker 1>what is human being look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.893
<v Speaker 1>the Buddhists say life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first fundamental Buddhist </v>

65
00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:53.934
<v Speaker 1>dictum and I suppose a modern person </v>
<v Speaker 1>would tend to think of that as a very </v>

66
00:03:58.501 --> 00:03:59.334
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic claim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've found when I've shared that </v>

67
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.980
<v Speaker 1>information with my students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they understand what it means,</v>

68
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:05.814
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a relief because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>run around madly suffering away and all </v>

69
00:04:10.531 --> 00:04:13.260
<v Speaker 1>of them inside their little shell think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

70
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>there must be something wrong with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because here I am suffering and you know</v>

71
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:17.404
<v Speaker 1>what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that isn't how things are supposed </v>

72
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.750
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might say,</v>

73
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.420
<v Speaker 1>who says that's not the way things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be?</v>

74
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.733
<v Speaker 1>The Buddhist say life is suffering so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what that means is if you're not </v>

75
00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:30.720
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>

76
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.400
<v Speaker 1>That's lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fortunate.</v>

77
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>That's not the way of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may be something to be grateful for</v>

78
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:38.700
<v Speaker 1>ecstatic about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even,</v>

79
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.863
<v Speaker 1>and of course in Christianity the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central symbol of Christianity is a </v>

80
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:42.924
<v Speaker 1>crucifix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not a positive symbol in any </v>

81
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:48.900
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of betrayal by friends,</v>

82
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 1>opposition from the state and mortal </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

83
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.193
<v Speaker 1>It's about as powerful a symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the idea that life is </v>

84
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:02.640
<v Speaker 1>suffering as you can put together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course why the power of that</v>

85
00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 1>symbol extends across several thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

86
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Judy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

87
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.513
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's going to come as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shock to anybody in the audience that </v>

88
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Jews are acutely aware of the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's involved in life.</v>

89
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

90
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.520
<v Speaker 1>so it's useful to know to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it means that life is suffering.</v>

91
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.383
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamental ontological truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamental statement about the </v>

92
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>nature of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a reason for that.</v>

93
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not incomprehensible.</v>

94
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>It's perfectly comprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're finite,</v>

95
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.783
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lifespan that's bounded </v>

96
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.823
<v Speaker 1>temporarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to live maybe a hundred </v>

97
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.373
<v Speaker 1>years and that'll pretty much be it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's other forms of extreme </v>

98
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>limitations that are imposed on you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have very little to do with you.</v>

99
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 1>They're arbitrary facts of being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a certain height,</v>

100
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>you're a certain weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a certain amount of attractive,</v>

101
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>you're a certain amount of intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a certain amount of athletic,</v>

102
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.803
<v Speaker 1>you're a certain amount of mentally ill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a certain amount of </v>

103
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:11.411
<v Speaker 1>predisposition to cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's frequently the case that people</v>

104
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:17.381
<v Speaker 1>like to attribute those vulnerabilities </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some flaw in their own nature,</v>

105
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 1>what they are instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our conditions of existence,</v>

106
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.083
<v Speaker 1>human being is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is predicated on a kind of fundamental </v>

107
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 1>limitation in that we are what we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not other things.</v>

108
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.533
<v Speaker 1>And so that means inevitably that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness of human being comes along </v>

109
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 1>with suffering in life poses the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question</v>

110
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.240
<v Speaker 1>how to conduct yourself in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

111
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.103
<v Speaker 1>Not only yours but everyone else's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's an inescapable question except </v>

112
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:51.214
<v Speaker 1>that maybe you're fortunate and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>have periods of time where something </v>

113
00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:57.700
<v Speaker 1>absolutely horrible isn't helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to you.</v>

114
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.343
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about this because you might </v>

115
00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:03.100
<v Speaker 1>think this is pessimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not pessimistic.</v>

116
00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:03.934
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually one of the most freeing </v>

117
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:09.130
<v Speaker 1>things that you can realize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's nothing particularly wrong</v>

118
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:09.964
<v Speaker 1>with you at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a high probability that you </v>

119
00:07:12.551 --> 00:07:13.384
<v Speaker 1>have a family member that has something </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously wrong with them and there's a </v>

120
00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:20.020
<v Speaker 1>very high probability that if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will soon,</v>

121
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.620
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you'll have a partner that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>something serious wrong with them.</v>

122
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.763
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to know this frees you from the </v>

123
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:27.904
<v Speaker 1>false illusion that life can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducted without suffering suffering's </v>

124
00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:36.730
<v Speaker 1>an integral part of the now why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

125
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.130
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a metaphysical question.</v>

126
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Would I have some ideas about that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have helped me and that there are things</v>

127
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:44.320
<v Speaker 1>that I've read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read,</v>

128
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:45.154
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old Jewish commentary about the </v>

129
00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:51.430
<v Speaker 1>reason for creation there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Zen Koan.</v>

130
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:55.290
<v Speaker 1>This idea of you take the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

131
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.253
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being with the classical attributes of </v>

132
00:07:57.191 --> 00:07:58.024
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

133
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>omnipotence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Omnipresence,</v>

134
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.380
<v Speaker 1>and omniscient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

135
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a totality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

136
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it being with those attributes?</v>

137
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Lack and is limitation.</v>

138
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

139
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

140
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>what's so important about limitation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

141
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 1>if you can be anything or do anything at</v>
<v Speaker 1>any time whatsoever,</v>

142
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 1>there's no being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything is one thing.</v>

143
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 1>There's no differentiation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

144
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 1>So something that's absolute and total </v>
<v Speaker 1>has no being.</v>

145
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>It has to be parceled out into limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>being just,</v>

146
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.390
<v Speaker 1>and you know this because you'll all </v>
<v Speaker 1>play games.</v>

147
00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 1>You play video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play games with other people.</v>

148
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.280
<v Speaker 1>You may play games you don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're playing.</v>

149
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 1>And when you play those games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put,</v>

150
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.400
<v Speaker 1>you put limits on yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play by a set of rules.</v>

151
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:50.060
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you do that is when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>limit yourself arbitrarily,</v>

152
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>in some ways whole new worlds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility emerge.</v>

153
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.003
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a powerful metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that being is not possible without </v>

154
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 1>limitation.</v>

155
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.263
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

156
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.160
<v Speaker 1>so that's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting idea.</v>

157
00:09:04.161 --> 00:09:04.994
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the price you pay for being </v>

158
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:07.603
<v Speaker 1>the price you pay for being his </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitation and the price you pay for </v>

159
00:09:09.531 --> 00:09:10.364
<v Speaker 1>limitation is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the price you pay for being is </v>

160
00:09:12.261 --> 00:09:17.261
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the problem with that?</v>

161
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.743
<v Speaker 2>Wrong</v>

162
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.100
<v Speaker 1>suffering makes people question the </v>
<v Speaker 1>validity of life,</v>

163
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every everyone does that.</v>

164
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.330
<v Speaker 1>If something terrible is happening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

165
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.550
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna wonder why you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure why not?</v>

166
00:09:37.551 --> 00:09:40.460
<v Speaker 1>You might be a better question because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inevitable,</v>

167
00:09:40.461 --> 00:09:43.130
<v Speaker 1>but you will wonder that why you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll wonder,</v>

168
00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:44.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it worth it?</v>

169
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Especially if what's happening to you is</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible and prolonged.</v>

170
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.003
<v Speaker 1>Is it worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the cars that you have to pay </v>

171
00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:52.544
<v Speaker 1>for being justified itself and therefore</v>
<v Speaker 1>is being justifiable and everybody has </v>

172
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:03.140
<v Speaker 1>it asks and answers these questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

173
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.143
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

174
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:08.180
<v Speaker 1>The process of asking and answering </v>
<v Speaker 1>those questions underlies everything you</v>

175
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.740
<v Speaker 1>do all the time because you're answering</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you act one answer,</v>

176
00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:17.741
<v Speaker 1>which is yes being justifies itself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're answering a different way.</v>

177
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:18.584
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when you act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is no being does not justify </v>

178
00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:21.104
<v Speaker 1>itself and the question then might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you answer one of </v>

179
00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:28.844
<v Speaker 1>those two ways.</v>

180
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.813
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

181
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.413
<v Speaker 1>Don untangle this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I want to do is to talk </v>

182
00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:34.964
<v Speaker 1>to you about the antithesis of virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's always struck me that when </v>

183
00:10:39.981 --> 00:10:40.814
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could conceivably be regarded as </v>

184
00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:43.784
<v Speaker 1>optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult for people to </v>

185
00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:48.830
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

186
00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:50.420
<v Speaker 1>gave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I stood on stage and said,</v>

187
00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of life is to be happy you,</v>

188
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.993
<v Speaker 1>you might find out vaguely comforting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a chance in the world </v>

189
00:10:57.531 --> 00:10:59.390
<v Speaker 1>that you believe that if you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ounce of sense,</v>

190
00:10:59.391 --> 00:11:00.224
<v Speaker 1>because if you lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that there will be periods of </v>

191
00:11:05.451 --> 00:11:07.280
<v Speaker 1>time where happiness is not your state.</v>

192
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

193
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.653
<v Speaker 1>And so there has to be more to life than</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness because there'll be a lot of </v>

194
00:11:11.941 --> 00:11:13.080
<v Speaker 1>your life that isn't happy.</v>

195
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

196
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.453
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who wrote the </v>

197
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:19.704
<v Speaker 1>book the Gulag Archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one of the axes that brought </v>

198
00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:23.994
<v Speaker 1>down the thick tree of call me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This utopian hasn't said over the idea </v>

199
00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 1>that human beings are made for </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

200
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:37.431
<v Speaker 1>He said that that's a philosophy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermined by the first blow of the work</v>

201
00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:39.714
<v Speaker 1>assigners Cudgel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he meant by that was if you </v>

202
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:44.970
<v Speaker 1>find yourself in a particularly terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

203
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:46.500
<v Speaker 1>if you're in slaved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

204
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:47.334
<v Speaker 1>by</v>

205
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:48.350
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

206
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:49.183
<v Speaker 1>malevolent utopians and they're pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a form of slavery and they're </v>

207
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:55.834
<v Speaker 1>beating you to attain their ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you're made for happiness </v>

208
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 1>is not going to be of much comfort under</v>
<v Speaker 1>those circumstances.</v>

209
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 1>And so social insistence point was your </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakened by your belief that life is for</v>

210
00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:08.014
<v Speaker 1>happiness because that philosophy cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustain any sustained challenge and you </v>

211
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:15.250
<v Speaker 1>will for sure encounters such as sustain</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>

212
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.593
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

213
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that modern people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in virtue,</v>

214
00:12:22.891 --> 00:12:26.880
<v Speaker 1>but not easily because it's virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds religious in a sense.</v>

215
00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:27.714
<v Speaker 1>And we have real trouble whether we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious or not with religious </v>

216
00:12:31.171 --> 00:12:32.004
<v Speaker 1>preconceptions because our scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of knowledge and our fundamental </v>

217
00:12:36.691 --> 00:12:41.691
<v Speaker 1>materialism has really radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermined our ability to believe in any</v>

218
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.100
<v Speaker 1>transcendent being.</v>

219
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

220
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.760
<v Speaker 1>But one thing that modern people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>

221
00:12:47.761 --> 00:12:50.010
<v Speaker 1>I think without much difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all is evil.</v>

222
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

223
00:12:54.261 --> 00:12:59.261
<v Speaker 1>that the most important event of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century as far as he was concerned,</v>

224
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.840
<v Speaker 1>was the Nuremberg judgment.</v>

225
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:04.623
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

226
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may know,</v>

227
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.983
<v Speaker 1>you should know that after World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of national socialists from </v>

228
00:13:13.441 --> 00:13:14.274
<v Speaker 1>Germany who were deemed particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the absolute horrors of </v>

229
00:13:19.471 --> 00:13:24.471
<v Speaker 1>the final solution and a mass factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>genocide that accompany,</v>

230
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.850
<v Speaker 1>that were put on trial</v>

231
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.723
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

232
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.380
<v Speaker 1>a standard defense for their actions </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

233
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was ordered to do it.</v>

234
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

235
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.483
<v Speaker 1>And the Nuremberg decision denied human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings regardless of their ethnicity or </v>

236
00:13:43.521 --> 00:13:48.521
<v Speaker 1>national background or beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The legal right to use that as a defense</v>

237
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.503
<v Speaker 1>under certain limited circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the argument was there are some </v>

238
00:13:55.191 --> 00:13:58.670
<v Speaker 1>things that are so self evidently not </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

239
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.220
<v Speaker 1>not virtuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you engage in them,</v>

240
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.420
<v Speaker 1>you're existentially guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're guilty outside the bounds of your</v>

241
00:14:05.421 --> 00:14:06.254
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a trans national and Trans </v>

242
00:14:09.321 --> 00:14:10.970
<v Speaker 1>ethnic morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what it is,</v>

243
00:14:10.971 --> 00:14:15.971
<v Speaker 1>but we know what it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't pointless torture in genocide,</v>

244
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.133
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

245
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>At minimum to be virtuous is to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life in such a way</v>

246
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.943
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

247
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.393
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you would engage in</v>
<v Speaker 1>such actions given the opportunity is </v>

248
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:35.240
<v Speaker 1>minimized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people think,</v>

249
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.443
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're already doing that because if </v>

250
00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:38.294
<v Speaker 1>they were in Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have been rescue or not a </v>

251
00:14:42.171 --> 00:14:43.790
<v Speaker 1>perpetrator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's wrong.</v>

252
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.150
<v Speaker 1>You could take this audience and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>them back in 1939 or thereabouts and 90%</v>

253
00:14:50.151 --> 00:14:52.460
<v Speaker 1>of you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>95% of you,</v>

254
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.353
<v Speaker 1>99% of you would either be in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetrator class or the going along </v>

255
00:14:58.401 --> 00:14:59.234
<v Speaker 1>with the perpetrator class and you may </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit and believe that you'd be in the 1% </v>

256
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:05.234
<v Speaker 1>maybe you would because how do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't how the historical facts </v>

257
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:10.010
<v Speaker 1>sort themselves out</v>

258
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:12.993
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out that it's not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult generally to put people in a </v>

259
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:18.760
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal people where they'll do something</v>

260
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.863
<v Speaker 1>that really doesn't look very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those of you who are familiar with </v>

261
00:15:23.681 --> 00:15:25.630
<v Speaker 1>psychology know about the milgram </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments,</v>

262
00:15:25.631 --> 00:15:26.464
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and know about the Zimbardo prison </v>

263
00:15:28.031 --> 00:15:28.864
<v Speaker 1>experiment to take perfectly normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>college students and put them into a </v>

264
00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:37.060
<v Speaker 1>situation that they know is a dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest they know isn't real.</v>

265
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Give some of them the power of prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>guards and make some of them,</v>

266
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.630
<v Speaker 1>some others arbitrarily into prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In three days,</v>

267
00:15:43.631 --> 00:15:44.464
<v Speaker 1>you have to shut the whole experiment </v>
<v Speaker 1>down because of the prison guards have </v>

268
00:15:46.901 --> 00:15:51.790
<v Speaker 1>turned into Nazis and they're enjoying </v>
<v Speaker 1>torturing the prisoners even though they</v>

269
00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:54.250
<v Speaker 1>know whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No means that they're innocent.</v>

270
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

271
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.063
<v Speaker 1>well that says something about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner in which people conduct their </v>

272
00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:01.024
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very susceptible to mlevel into </v>

273
00:16:04.631 --> 00:16:07.360
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at Genesis,</v>

274
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:08.583
<v Speaker 1>very old book and very influential book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a strange sequence of events </v>

275
00:16:14.651 --> 00:16:16.210
<v Speaker 1>that be falls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Eve,</v>

276
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.423
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

277
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:18.573
<v Speaker 1>it's in two sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That snake gives them an apple and that </v>

278
00:16:25.091 --> 00:16:26.470
<v Speaker 1>wakes them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

279
00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:27.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a good book by a</v>

280
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.553
<v Speaker 1>southern California primatologist that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just published last year that </v>

281
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:34.694
<v Speaker 1>suggests that the reason that humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>have such great vision way better than </v>

282
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:38.954
<v Speaker 1>most animals except for raptors birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because our visual systems were </v>

283
00:16:43.041 --> 00:16:43.874
<v Speaker 1>designed to detect predatory snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way she discovered that was by </v>

284
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:48.524
<v Speaker 1>comparing the populations of predatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes around the world to the visual </v>

285
00:16:51.141 --> 00:16:53.570
<v Speaker 1>acuity of the primate groups that lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>in those areas.</v>

286
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:58.070
<v Speaker 1>And what she found was essentially a one</v>
<v Speaker 1>to one correspondence our visual system,</v>

287
00:16:58.071 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 1>which is the ability to see and to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened,</v>

288
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:03.230
<v Speaker 1>let say because enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

289
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:06.950
<v Speaker 1>is associated with vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The snake gave that to us because we had</v>

290
00:17:06.951 --> 00:17:07.784
<v Speaker 1>to pay attention to predatory things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were after us for tens of millions </v>

291
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:12.710
<v Speaker 1>of years and fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

292
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.530
<v Speaker 1>We have color vision because we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit eaters.</v>

293
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Our color vision is precisely evolved to</v>
<v Speaker 1>detect right fruit,</v>

294
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.700
<v Speaker 1>so that part of the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

295
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:26.483
<v Speaker 1>There's a story that involves women too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to tell that one </v>

296
00:17:28.501 --> 00:17:33.360
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be awake out smart women.</v>

297
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.063
<v Speaker 1>That's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why they're tangled in </v>

298
00:17:37.351 --> 00:17:38.184
<v Speaker 1>there with the Syrup and Sam the fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens when Adam and Eve wake </v>

299
00:17:42.871 --> 00:17:43.510
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

300
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.420
<v Speaker 1>say it's this series of strange things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that happens is that the</v>

301
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.930
<v Speaker 1>scales fall from their eyes so they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>see all of a,</v>

302
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.033
<v Speaker 1>they're awake in a way they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and the next thing that happens </v>

303
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>is they realize they're naked.</v>

304
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that people,</v>

305
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.750
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

306
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.160
<v Speaker 1>to have nightmares about his being naked</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a stage,</v>

307
00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 1>which is often why when you see people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a stage,</v>

308
00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.213
<v Speaker 1>they don't tell you anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think because they don't only not </v>

309
00:18:05.981 --> 00:18:06.814
<v Speaker 1>want to be physically naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to be metaphysically </v>

310
00:18:08.261 --> 00:18:13.000
<v Speaker 1>naked either and they protect themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the inquiring eyes of the audience.</v>

311
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.820
<v Speaker 1>No one likes to be naked on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

312
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:16.803
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be naked is to have your defenses </v>

313
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.633
<v Speaker 1>stripped from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the Soviets wanted to really </v>

314
00:18:21.011 --> 00:18:23.110
<v Speaker 1>torture the hell out of you at two </v>
<v Speaker 1>o'clock in the morning,</v>

315
00:18:23.111 --> 00:18:27.250
<v Speaker 1>they'd stave in your door and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd strip you and shave you when they</v>

316
00:18:27.251 --> 00:18:32.251
<v Speaker 1>got you to prison because it's once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were exposed in all your suffering,</v>

317
00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:36.820
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are much easier to torture.</v>

318
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:38.913
<v Speaker 1>To be naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To realize you're naked is to realize </v>

319
00:18:40.721 --> 00:18:44.320
<v Speaker 1>that you're vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're vulnerable.</v>

320
00:18:44.321 --> 00:18:46.540
<v Speaker 1>That's why Adam and eve immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover themselves up,</v>

321
00:18:46.541 --> 00:18:46.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

322
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.310
<v Speaker 1>They realize they're naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cover themselves up.</v>

323
00:18:48.311 --> 00:18:49.144
<v Speaker 1>It's a story about culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once people woke up and realize their </v>

324
00:18:52.421 --> 00:18:54.850
<v Speaker 1>limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mortal limitations,</v>

325
00:18:54.851 --> 00:18:55.684
<v Speaker 1>which is also their knowledge of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they do is cover </v>

326
00:18:57.341 --> 00:18:58.174
<v Speaker 1>themselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing that happens is </v>

327
00:19:00.461 --> 00:19:02.530
<v Speaker 1>they know the difference between good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil,</v>

328
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good and bad.</v>

329
00:19:05.501 --> 00:19:06.334
<v Speaker 1>It's good and evil specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also something that animals don't </v>

330
00:19:08.381 --> 00:19:09.214
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I thought about this really </v>

331
00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:13.240
<v Speaker 1>for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

332
00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.940
<v Speaker 1>And then earlier this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I figured it out.</v>

333
00:19:15.941 --> 00:19:16.774
<v Speaker 1>I think what it means is you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to torture people until you realize </v>

334
00:19:20.381 --> 00:19:21.214
<v Speaker 1>that you're vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as your self conscious of your </v>

335
00:19:24.191 --> 00:19:25.024
<v Speaker 1>own vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can take what might only be a </v>

336
00:19:27.551 --> 00:19:28.384
<v Speaker 1>predatory act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say on the part of a wolf because of </v>

337
00:19:30.411 --> 00:19:31.244
<v Speaker 1>wolf will bring down a moose or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and eat it and drag </v>

338
00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:37.840
<v Speaker 1>that out in two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three months of artistic torturing.</v>

339
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:40.693
<v Speaker 1>And so that means that your recognition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your own vulnerability immediately </v>

340
00:19:44.121 --> 00:19:49.121
<v Speaker 1>allows you to determine what's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

341
00:19:50.361 --> 00:19:52.790
<v Speaker 1>so then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

342
00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:57.791
<v Speaker 1>under what conditions would you be </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to manifest that drive?</v>

343
00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's easy to figure out if you</v>

344
00:20:02.621 --> 00:20:04.840
<v Speaker 1>watch yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.430
<v Speaker 1>if you watch yourself without </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition,</v>

346
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.910
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means to watch yourself honestly,</v>

347
00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.900
<v Speaker 1>or to watch yourself as if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone you don't know because you don't</v>

348
00:20:13.901 --> 00:20:16.830
<v Speaker 1>know yourself because you're too </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated to know yourself anyway.</v>

349
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:19.930
<v Speaker 1>So you might as well just come right out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and know that.</v>

350
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.633
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's kind of useful </v>

351
00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:24.760
<v Speaker 1>about recognizing your capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>

352
00:20:24.761 --> 00:20:25.594
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can do that without traumatizing </v>

353
00:20:26.651 --> 00:20:27.484
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's the pathway to recognizing </v>

354
00:20:28.871 --> 00:20:29.704
<v Speaker 1>your ability for good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to one without the other </v>

355
00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.220
<v Speaker 1>because you have no idea what your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you know how terrible you can be.</v>

356
00:20:36.221 --> 00:20:37.054
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't take yourself sufficiently </v>

357
00:20:38.591 --> 00:20:40.300
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

358
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.313
<v Speaker 1>If you know you're a loaded weapon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>an unstable loaded weapon and you're </v>

359
00:20:46.461 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do,</v>

360
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but that means you're not particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

361
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.510
<v Speaker 1>And it means that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

362
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.453
<v Speaker 1>if you were given the opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you would have been a Nazi prison </v>

363
00:20:57.761 --> 00:21:02.180
<v Speaker 1>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in genesis,</v>

364
00:21:02.181 --> 00:21:04.810
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that happens after Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eve wake up is they,</v>

365
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:05.691
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

366
00:21:05.691 --> 00:21:06.524
<v Speaker 1>they have two sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel and Cain who's ables </v>

367
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.710
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't get along very well with God.</v>

368
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.633
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care if you believe in </v>

369
00:21:17.331 --> 00:21:18.164
<v Speaker 1>God because I don't know what people </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean when they say they believe in God </v>

370
00:21:21.351 --> 00:21:22.184
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

371
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.180
<v Speaker 1>the story goes that cane doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>along very well with God.</v>

372
00:21:27.181 --> 00:21:28.014
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps doing things and they don't work </v>

373
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.550
<v Speaker 1>his everything cane touches turns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ash,</v>

374
00:21:35.551 --> 00:21:36.960
<v Speaker 1>whereas his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abel,</v>

375
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:37.973
<v Speaker 1>God likes him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows why and everything goes </v>

376
00:21:40.111 --> 00:21:40.944
<v Speaker 1>real well for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so Kane Kane is kind of a failure </v>

377
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:45.863
<v Speaker 1>and enables a smashing success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only is he successful at </v>

378
00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:50.340
<v Speaker 1>everything he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a good guy too,</v>

379
00:21:50.341 --> 00:21:53.790
<v Speaker 1>which is really rude because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really successful at things,</v>

380
00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:54.624
<v Speaker 1>you should at least be wretched </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpersonally so that people can </v>

381
00:21:57.421 --> 00:21:58.930
<v Speaker 1>forgive you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

382
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.840
<v Speaker 1>so kane takes this for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:22:03.841 --> 00:22:05.550
<v Speaker 1>a decade or two and then he's just had </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

384
00:22:05.551 --> 00:22:07.380
<v Speaker 1>he's had it with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks,</v>

385
00:22:07.381 --> 00:22:08.214
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can God make this sort of universe </v>

386
00:22:09.271 --> 00:22:10.104
<v Speaker 1>where I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.123
<v Speaker 1>breaking myself and half here and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere in my brother's doors open for </v>

388
00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:14.491
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

389
00:22:14.491 --> 00:22:15.120
<v Speaker 1>right and center.</v>

390
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.010
<v Speaker 1>So it goes and complains to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

391
00:22:17.011 --> 00:22:18.120
<v Speaker 1>look what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

392
00:22:18.121 --> 00:22:20.040
<v Speaker 1>What sort of reality did you conjure up </v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

393
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Mabel has it good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a miserable time.</v>

394
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should do something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

395
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.970
<v Speaker 1>And you think that's pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that,</v>

396
00:22:28.971 --> 00:22:29.804
<v Speaker 1>that cain would think that because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to ask yourself what sort of </v>

397
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.160
<v Speaker 1>presumption does cain house to assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the digital quality of his being is</v>

398
00:22:40.591 --> 00:22:44.160
<v Speaker 1>attributable to God?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what Kane does,</v>

399
00:22:44.161 --> 00:22:48.240
<v Speaker 1>it not instant is to make himself the </v>
<v Speaker 1>judge of being.</v>

400
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.740
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cautious about making yourself the judge</v>

401
00:22:52.741 --> 00:22:53.574
<v Speaker 1>of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's always the possibility </v>

402
00:22:54.691 --> 00:22:56.760
<v Speaker 1>that there's a few things that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

403
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.370
<v Speaker 1>So go ahead and sort of lets paint in on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the secret.</v>

404
00:22:59.371 --> 00:23:00.204
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

405
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.600
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're a suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserably away actually isn't my fault.</v>

406
00:23:03.601 --> 00:23:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It's your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says to Cain,</v>

407
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Sin Crouches at the door like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory cat ready to jump on you.</v>

408
00:23:10.411 --> 00:23:13.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you wanted to you could overcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

409
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.880
<v Speaker 1>This is not what cain wants to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take.</v>

410
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:18.723
<v Speaker 1>Cain wants to hear that he's an innocent</v>
<v Speaker 1>character and he has nothing to do with </v>

411
00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:24.760
<v Speaker 1>his own misery and it's all God's fault </v>
<v Speaker 1>and God says instead,</v>

412
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.550
<v Speaker 1>straighten the hell up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you could do it</v>

413
00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.560
<v Speaker 1>and even though you know you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

414
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.590
<v Speaker 1>you won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that that's that for cane.</v>

415
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.091
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

416
00:23:35.091 --> 00:23:37.370
<v Speaker 1>he was upset when he first went into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion,</v>

417
00:23:37.371 --> 00:23:38.204
<v Speaker 1>but after he got this little piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>news that his suffering was to be laid </v>

418
00:23:40.701 --> 00:23:44.990
<v Speaker 1>at his own doorstep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he's out of the realm of human.</v>

419
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:49.820
<v Speaker 1>And the story says his countenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Falls means he's angry and upset and the</v>

420
00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:51.620
<v Speaker 1>first thing he does is run off and kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abel.</v>

421
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Why walks revenge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

422
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.853
<v Speaker 1>Table was God's favorite and Cain has </v>
<v Speaker 1>already judged being and found it </v>

423
00:24:01.271 --> 00:24:03.850
<v Speaker 1>wanting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the best way that he can express his</v>

424
00:24:03.851 --> 00:24:04.684
<v Speaker 1>desire for revenge is to find someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's having a pretty good time of it </v>

425
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.630
<v Speaker 1>and to arbitrarily eliminate them.</v>

426
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

427
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:12.923
<v Speaker 1>It might be of some interest to note </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of keynes grandchildren is the </v>

428
00:24:18.931 --> 00:24:19.764
<v Speaker 1>first person who makes weapons of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that brilliant little story so long </v>

429
00:24:25.051 --> 00:24:25.884
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>associates the moral failings of the </v>

430
00:24:28.021 --> 00:24:28.854
<v Speaker 1>resentful individual who's unwilling to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take responsibility for the nature of </v>

431
00:24:33.211 --> 00:24:38.211
<v Speaker 1>their own being directly with atrocious </v>
<v Speaker 1>acts of social conflict.</v>

432
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing to know because</v>

433
00:24:42.511 --> 00:24:44.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be virtuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take yourself seriously.</v>

434
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.120
<v Speaker 1>And if you start to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're networked with other people,</v>

435
00:24:48.121 --> 00:24:53.121
<v Speaker 1>you're not one little dark among 7 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion year network with other people.</v>

436
00:24:53.311 --> 00:24:57.030
<v Speaker 1>So you know a thousand people and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>know a thousand people and so you're two</v>

437
00:24:57.031 --> 00:25:00.750
<v Speaker 1>people away from a million people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>three people away from a billion people.</v>

438
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.960
<v Speaker 1>You're in a causal network and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your actions matter.</v>

439
00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:05.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn said there's many centers </v>

440
00:25:07.301 --> 00:25:10.510
<v Speaker 1>of the universe says there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual consciousnesses,</v>

441
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very interesting way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think and why can't it be that way?</v>

442
00:25:14.501 --> 00:25:15.334
<v Speaker 1>We don't know anything about conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and it certainly seems to </v>

443
00:25:18.641 --> 00:25:21.730
<v Speaker 1>be how it feels if you're one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious centers.</v>

444
00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:23.950
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe it is that what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

445
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.103
<v Speaker 1>I think that often people come to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that life is meaningless </v>

446
00:25:28.781 --> 00:25:32.920
<v Speaker 1>because that's a better conclusion to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to then the reverse because if life</v>

447
00:25:32.921 --> 00:25:36.130
<v Speaker 1>is meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then who cares what you do?</v>

448
00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.920
<v Speaker 1>But if life is meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if what you do matters,</v>

449
00:25:38.921 --> 00:25:39.754
<v Speaker 1>then everything you do matters and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts a terrible responsibility on the </v>

450
00:25:44.051 --> 00:25:48.280
<v Speaker 1>individual and I think that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally unwilling to bear that.</v>

451
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:53.683
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

452
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Speaker 1>so life is suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that do to people?</v>

453
00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Makes them resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are pitfalls of being so being has</v>

454
00:26:03.771 --> 00:26:04.604
<v Speaker 1>a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of its fundamental structural </v>

455
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:09.290
<v Speaker 1>elements is suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but suffering produces other.</v>

456
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

457
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Characteristics of being resentment is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of being.</v>

458
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.293
<v Speaker 1>People feel resentful when they believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've been taken advantage of it </v>

459
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.693
<v Speaker 1>and maybe if you feel resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be that you're being taken </v>

460
00:26:23.761 --> 00:26:24.594
<v Speaker 1>advantage of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may also be that you should screw </v>

461
00:26:26.491 --> 00:26:27.324
<v Speaker 1>your head on straight and look at things</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly and it may also be that you </v>

462
00:26:29.731 --> 00:26:32.820
<v Speaker 1>should talk to somebody to find out if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're</v>

463
00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.660
<v Speaker 1>being taken advantage of or if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>head just isn't screwed on straight,</v>

464
00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.940
<v Speaker 1>but to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to tell them the truth and</v>

465
00:26:39.941 --> 00:26:40.774
<v Speaker 1>in order to tell them the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have practiced being honest </v>

466
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.780
<v Speaker 1>because if you haven't practiced being </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest,</v>

467
00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:47.730
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to have a friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can talk to.</v>

468
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.713
<v Speaker 1>And even if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't be able to tell them what the </v>

469
00:26:49.651 --> 00:26:50.484
<v Speaker 1>problem is and then they won't be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help you sort out whether or not </v>

470
00:26:52.651 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 1>you're being taken advantage of or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a little bit insane.</v>

471
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

472
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.673
<v Speaker 1>If you're resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you have to tell the person </v>

473
00:27:03.571 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 1>who's taking advantage of you that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should stop doing that.</v>

474
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:09.630
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you have to tell them in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will make them stop,</v>

475
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.670
<v Speaker 1>which is no easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you're resentful because you're</v>

476
00:27:13.671 --> 00:27:14.504
<v Speaker 1>a nasty little bit of the world and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you have a chip on your shoulder </v>

477
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:20.120
<v Speaker 1>and no matter what people do with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're resentful,</v>

478
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:24.750
<v Speaker 1>in which case you have some internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>restructuring to do.</v>

479
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.610
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

480
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:29.940
<v Speaker 1>why should you do the restructuring?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is that well,</v>

481
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:30.774
<v Speaker 1>resentment along with hopelessness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilism and all sorts of other moral </v>

482
00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:37.800
<v Speaker 1>pitfalls puts you on the road to cruelty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and atrocity.</v>

483
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.593
<v Speaker 1>Misery loves company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you feel that things are </v>

484
00:27:42.121 --> 00:27:42.954
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally unjust and that the slings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and arrows of being are aimed </v>

485
00:27:46.451 --> 00:27:47.284
<v Speaker 1>specifically at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should you treat anyone else with </v>

486
00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:50.424
<v Speaker 1>compassion or justice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because things are fundamentally unfair </v>

487
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:54.883
<v Speaker 1>and and even more deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why shouldn't you conclude that things </v>

488
00:27:57.541 --> 00:28:01.260
<v Speaker 1>should be eradicated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because fundamentally they're unfair.</v>

489
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.533
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what Hitler conclude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think that's what stolen </v>

490
00:28:05.711 --> 00:28:06.544
<v Speaker 1>concluded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The evidence suggest that Stellan was </v>

491
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.480
<v Speaker 1>gearing up for the Third World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

492
00:28:10.481 --> 00:28:14.560
<v Speaker 1>he had hydrogen bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd already killed 30 million people.</v>

493
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had his practice trials</v>

494
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.583
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an old psychoanalytic idea and </v>

495
00:28:21.031 --> 00:28:24.930
<v Speaker 1>the idea is if you can't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations for the behavior,</v>

496
00:28:24.931 --> 00:28:27.090
<v Speaker 1>look at the outcome and in further </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>

497
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:27.924
<v Speaker 1>And so Hitler killed 100 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you include the whole Second World </v>

498
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:34.374
<v Speaker 1>War and God only knows how many Stalin </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed in my old killed more than </v>

499
00:28:37.531 --> 00:28:38.850
<v Speaker 1>stellar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

500
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Well of their cover story was utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess people belief that,</v>

501
00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:46.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did look very utopian when all those</v>

502
00:28:46.561 --> 00:28:47.394
<v Speaker 1>millions of people were dying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all those people who </v>

503
00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:50.604
<v Speaker 1>participated in those processes used </v>
<v Speaker 1>their rational utopianism as a cover </v>

504
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:58.410
<v Speaker 1>story for their willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in the atrocity.</v>

505
00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Because what they wanted to do was </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in the atrocities.</v>

506
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.500
<v Speaker 1>They didn't give a damn about utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you ask yourself,</v>

507
00:29:04.501 --> 00:29:04.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

508
00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:09.240
<v Speaker 1>how much do you try to force the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>to behave according to your terms?</v>

509
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:10.583
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there Catholics have always had trouble </v>

510
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:12.744
<v Speaker 1>with rationality and modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially this sort of hyper atheists </v>

511
00:29:15.841 --> 00:29:16.674
<v Speaker 1>that you hear from now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you don't like that because they </v>

512
00:29:18.811 --> 00:29:21.000
<v Speaker 1>believe that rationality is the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue.</v>

513
00:29:21.001 --> 00:29:22.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

514
00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:24.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible thing to say in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

515
00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:27.660
<v Speaker 1>except maybe the university isn't here </v>
<v Speaker 1>to teach you to be rational.</v>

516
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.733
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's here to teach you to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtuous and those aren't the same </v>

517
00:29:30.901 --> 00:29:32.910
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the rational person says,</v>

518
00:29:32.911 --> 00:29:33.744
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand and having understand </v>

519
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:36.534
<v Speaker 1>stood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I impose an order and then I work to </v>

520
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:39.504
<v Speaker 1>make that imposed order or reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what every Indian log does it </v>

521
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 1>what's whatever you Topian does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's convincing.</v>

522
00:29:46.751 --> 00:29:48.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason that people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is because they,</v>

523
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.973
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly they want an explanation for </v>

524
00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:53.620
<v Speaker 1>their Ba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly than that,</v>

525
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:58.830
<v Speaker 1>they want to mask that covers up their </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency to atrocity with the appearance</v>

526
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 1>of virtue and most Utopian thinking.</v>

527
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.043
<v Speaker 1>It's of that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the mass can be very well </v>

528
00:30:04.421 --> 00:30:07.480
<v Speaker 1>argued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you asked me why I believe that.</v>

529
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.433
<v Speaker 1>The reason I believe that it's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a hundred years of it and that's </v>

530
00:30:11.021 --> 00:30:11.854
<v Speaker 1>how it turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that was terrible </v>

531
00:30:14.381 --> 00:30:15.214
<v Speaker 1>about living in the Soviet Union was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you couldn't suffer because things </v>

532
00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:20.014
<v Speaker 1>were perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were suffering and you even </v>

533
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:23.944
<v Speaker 1>admitted it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are instantly an enemy of the </v>

534
00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:26.644
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're an idiot log your own </v>

535
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:30.250
<v Speaker 1>suffering makes you a heretic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

536
00:30:30.251 --> 00:30:31.084
<v Speaker 1>Do you undermine the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your belief and your own bloody system </v>

537
00:30:33.071 --> 00:30:35.770
<v Speaker 1>by suffering while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine if,</v>

538
00:30:35.771 --> 00:30:38.800
<v Speaker 1>if your belief has stopped you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering while more power to you.</v>

539
00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:43.210
<v Speaker 1>But if you're still suffering a bit or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot or a tremendous amount,</v>

540
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.830
<v Speaker 1>then you can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something I don't know.</v>

541
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Here's an existential exercise.</v>

542
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.130
<v Speaker 1>So in this is not rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have say it.</v>

543
00:30:54.131 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume that virtues worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing.</v>

544
00:30:56.591 --> 00:30:57.424
<v Speaker 1>And I say it's worth pursuing because a </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtuous path is the only path that </v>

545
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.380
<v Speaker 1>justifies being to itself as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of virtue.</v>

546
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:10.000
<v Speaker 1>A virtuous pass path justifies being to </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself being as suffering.</v>

547
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 1>So you need a justification for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

548
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:14.164
<v Speaker 1>So then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there times in my life when I feel </v>

549
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:22.210
<v Speaker 1>that my suffering is justified?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a good question.</v>

550
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.460
<v Speaker 1>And you could ask yourself the reverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>question two,</v>

551
00:31:24.461 --> 00:31:25.294
<v Speaker 1>which is are there times in my life when</v>
<v Speaker 1>my my suffering is clearly not </v>

552
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:30.790
<v Speaker 1>justified?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could say,</v>

553
00:31:30.791 --> 00:31:32.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch yourself for three weeks.</v>

554
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.333
<v Speaker 1>Just watch like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you don't know anything and see </v>

555
00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 1>when you're somewhere that justifies </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

556
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Now I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

557
00:31:43.091 --> 00:31:43.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I know?</v>

558
00:31:43.811 --> 00:31:44.411
<v Speaker 1>And I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

559
00:31:44.411 --> 00:31:45.550
<v Speaker 1>well here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some hints.</v>

560
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.800
<v Speaker 1>You're not self conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

561
00:31:47.801 --> 00:31:49.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not good to be self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

562
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.780
<v Speaker 1>It loads on neuroticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a negative emotion.</v>

563
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:53.614
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of it as a higher order </v>

564
00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:56.950
<v Speaker 1>cognitive function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people find it unpleasant.</v>

565
00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.370
<v Speaker 1>You tend to be self conscious when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're false or shamed.</v>

566
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.030
<v Speaker 1>If you're deeply engaged in something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your self consciousness disappears.</v>

567
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:08.350
<v Speaker 1>So engagement and something meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to make selfconsciousness vantage.</v>

568
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.120
<v Speaker 1>It also makes time vanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

569
00:32:10.121 --> 00:32:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is intrinsically meaningful,</v>

570
00:32:13.811 --> 00:32:16.690
<v Speaker 1>then the sense of passing time </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappears.</v>

571
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.840
<v Speaker 1>And so that temporal limitation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>plagues you vanishes.</v>

572
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.943
<v Speaker 1>And I could say maybe you're having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable time of it and you only spend </v>

573
00:32:23.771 --> 00:32:27.190
<v Speaker 1>2% of your waking hours in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>

574
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.840
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you don't even know when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

575
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:31.780
<v Speaker 1>but you could watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see,</v>

576
00:32:31.781 --> 00:32:33.100
<v Speaker 1>and you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

577
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.620
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent 10 minutes there.</v>

578
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.053
<v Speaker 1>I hardly even noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I felt that the of my being </v>

579
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 1>justified itself all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you wouldn't say that to yourself,</v>

580
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.220
<v Speaker 1>but you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say that was worth it.</v>

581
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:49.280
<v Speaker 1>And then I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

582
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:54.860
<v Speaker 1>practice that above all else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about everything else.</v>

583
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.530
<v Speaker 1>And then there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an alternative exercise.</v>

584
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention and figure out when </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely you're being does not justify</v>

585
00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:04.190
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's even easier,</v>

586
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that'll happen.</v>

587
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you do something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately regret or ashamed of or that</v>

588
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.510
<v Speaker 1>even more precisely makes you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>disintegrated in devalued.</v>

589
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Nisha said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people betray themselves for the sake of</v>

590
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:20.570
<v Speaker 1>their good name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>

591
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:24.740
<v Speaker 1>You can feel this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to center in your solar plexus.</v>

592
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.940
<v Speaker 1>When you say something or do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not virtuous,</v>

593
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.133
<v Speaker 1>then you will disintegrate and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're weak and you can feel that and </v>

594
00:33:32.331 --> 00:33:34.670
<v Speaker 1>then you'll cover it up with bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rattling arguments,</v>

595
00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:35.504
<v Speaker 1>trying to convince yourself and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that what you were doing was </v>

596
00:33:37.251 --> 00:33:39.320
<v Speaker 1>actually okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

597
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.453
<v Speaker 1>and it's your rational arrogance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism that forces you not to </v>

598
00:33:43.641 --> 00:33:44.474
<v Speaker 1>drop your stupid presuppositions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pay attention to what you're being </v>

599
00:33:48.021 --> 00:33:49.370
<v Speaker 1>is revealing to you.</v>

600
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.820
<v Speaker 1>We don't think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't think being reveals things.</v>

601
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.000
<v Speaker 1>It reveals things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't pay any attention.</v>

602
00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Why I think we don't want the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

603
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I really believe I've thought about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>

604
00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:06.440
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a quote from the Tao Te Ching.</v>

605
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.423
<v Speaker 1>I have a great translation of this book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was written by louts loud see years </v>

606
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 1>and years ago to one of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>classics of Literature.</v>

607
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:20.690
<v Speaker 1>The person who wrote this wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher.</v>

608
00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:23.120
<v Speaker 1>The person who wrote this was a master </v>
<v Speaker 1>of being.</v>

609
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.133
<v Speaker 1>That's a different thing cause if </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher thanks but a master being </v>

610
00:34:26.301 --> 00:34:27.134
<v Speaker 1>doesn't think because thinking is a tool</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being is something that supersedes </v>

611
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.693
<v Speaker 1>any tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it is by she thing intellects </v>

612
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:36.764
<v Speaker 1>bright light that the sage remains at </v>
<v Speaker 1>one with his own self ceasing to be </v>

613
00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:44.390
<v Speaker 1>aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By placing it behind detached.</v>

614
00:34:44.391 --> 00:34:47.900
<v Speaker 1>He is unified with his external world by</v>
<v Speaker 1>being selfless.</v>

615
00:34:47.901 --> 00:34:51.210
<v Speaker 1>He is fulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is selfhood is assured.</v>

616
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I show my students in my maps of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

617
00:34:58.051 --> 00:34:58.884
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nokia is a very complicated story for </v>

618
00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.260
<v Speaker 1>the Disney version in the previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>version.</v>

619
00:35:04.261 --> 00:35:05.094
<v Speaker 1>It's got a deep mythological base and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the thing that's happened in </v>

620
00:35:07.741 --> 00:35:08.574
<v Speaker 1>Pinell kill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of strange things happen that </v>

621
00:35:09.571 --> 00:35:10.680
<v Speaker 1>people just swallow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

622
00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:11.843
<v Speaker 1>There's a puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns into human being and there's a </v>

623
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.330
<v Speaker 1>talking cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's blue fairies,</v>

624
00:35:15.331 --> 00:35:17.760
<v Speaker 1>there's stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's whales that eat people,</v>

625
00:35:17.761 --> 00:35:19.860
<v Speaker 1>and everyone's swallows that with the no</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

626
00:35:19.861 --> 00:35:21.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll go to see Pinocchio.</v>

627
00:35:21.061 --> 00:35:25.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't even notice that a puppet has </v>
<v Speaker 1>just gone into a whale and you know what</v>

628
00:35:25.471 --> 00:35:26.304
<v Speaker 1>the hell is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you don't notice that is </v>

629
00:35:29.011 --> 00:35:31.200
<v Speaker 1>because it means something and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what it means,</v>

630
00:35:31.201 --> 00:35:32.034
<v Speaker 1>but you know that it means something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to ride on it weirdly </v>

631
00:35:35.521 --> 00:35:39.330
<v Speaker 1>enough because it compromises your </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational principles completely.</v>

632
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.190
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

633
00:35:41.191 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Speaker 1>These are religious experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have in movie theaters.</v>

634
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:46.710
<v Speaker 1>They suspend disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go along with it.</v>

635
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:48.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they believed it.</v>

636
00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:51.870
<v Speaker 1>And if someone says they lbu and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not real,</v>

637
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:52.704
<v Speaker 1>you say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you maybe you could shut up so I could </v>

638
00:35:54.301 --> 00:35:55.860
<v Speaker 1>watch a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

639
00:35:55.861 --> 00:35:58.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't want their rationality inter </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

640
00:35:58.051 --> 00:36:00.160
<v Speaker 1>it's the wrong time for it's the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>place for it.</v>

641
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.493
<v Speaker 1>Japan or wishes that his pep puppet </v>
<v Speaker 1>could become real is a very unlikely </v>

642
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:07.800
<v Speaker 1>wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something he says,</v>

643
00:36:07.801 --> 00:36:09.810
<v Speaker 1>very unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unlikely to happen.</v>

644
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I think actually Jimminy cricket says </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to have that happen in Japan,</v>

645
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to wish on a star.</v>

646
00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.593
<v Speaker 1>It was a strange idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wistar is something that's partakes of </v>

647
00:36:20.161 --> 00:36:20.994
<v Speaker 1>the divine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say that if you look at the </v>

648
00:36:22.321 --> 00:36:25.260
<v Speaker 1>night sky where you can really see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

649
00:36:25.261 --> 00:36:26.094
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at the night sky and infinity </v>

650
00:36:27.241 --> 00:36:30.740
<v Speaker 1>opens itself up before you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing to say except,</v>

651
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:32.790
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

652
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.623
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to say and to wish on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>star is to put your eyes above the </v>

653
00:36:37.741 --> 00:36:38.574
<v Speaker 1>horizon and to pick a transcendent point</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to wish for something to want for </v>

654
00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:43.614
<v Speaker 1>something that's beyond the concreted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and immediate and to become virtuous </v>

655
00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:50.724
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to not be a puppet is to aim at </v>

656
00:36:53.191 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 1>something transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say,</v>

657
00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:57.810
<v Speaker 1>well at least it's the absence of evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That something,</v>

658
00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's even more than that.</v>

659
00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's virtue in and of itself.</v>

660
00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

661
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a line in the sermon on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mount.</v>

662
00:37:06.421 --> 00:37:07.254
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange sermon and the line </v>
<v Speaker 1>is take therefore no thought for the </v>

663
00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:13.860
<v Speaker 1>morrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the moral shell.</v>

664
00:37:13.861 --> 00:37:14.694
<v Speaker 1>Take thought for the things of itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient unto the day is the evil </v>

665
00:37:17.731 --> 00:37:22.731
<v Speaker 1>thereof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange</v>

666
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.620
<v Speaker 1>piece of advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds completely impractical,</v>

667
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.473
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

668
00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:34.970
<v Speaker 1>limit the focus of your consciousness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day and leave the worries alone.</v>

669
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means something meditative.</v>

670
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I think when I do therapy with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to do this,</v>

671
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know if I do sometimes,</v>

672
00:37:49.141 --> 00:37:49.974
<v Speaker 1>but I shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily know what their </v>

673
00:37:54.391 --> 00:37:55.920
<v Speaker 1>problem is or what they should do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

674
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.983
<v Speaker 1>but I can listen and if I listen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I learned this in part from Carl </v>

675
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Rogers writings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I listened,</v>

676
00:38:03.771 --> 00:38:07.740
<v Speaker 1>then thoughts will occur to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking them.</v>

677
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:08.603
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm letting the thoughts come up and I </v>

678
00:38:10.881 --> 00:38:11.714
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell my clients try to tell me the </v>

679
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:13.524
<v Speaker 1>truth and I'll try to listen without </v>
<v Speaker 1>being too much of a son of a bitch and </v>

680
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:19.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can work something out and then</v>

681
00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:20.910
<v Speaker 1>they'll say something to me and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll think,</v>

682
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:21.744
<v Speaker 1>well that thing you said now in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you said half an hour ago don't </v>

683
00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:27.240
<v Speaker 1>seem to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't seem to be coherent.</v>

684
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.580
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you can straighten that out or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

685
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.150
<v Speaker 1>it seems more like I'm tracking what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying and when I'm listening to</v>

686
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:37.120
<v Speaker 1>them I'm in the same place they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know the neural mechanisms for that.</v>

687
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:37.954
<v Speaker 1>You are in the same place with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you really listen to them and then </v>

688
00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:41.970
<v Speaker 1>thoughts come up and I tell them what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are and it's,</v>

689
00:38:41.971 --> 00:38:42.804
<v Speaker 1>it's impersonal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impersonal because I'm not trying </v>

690
00:38:46.961 --> 00:38:47.794
<v Speaker 1>to get them to do anything particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just aiming maybe at helping them </v>

691
00:38:51.491 --> 00:38:52.324
<v Speaker 1>figure out what's going on and having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit less suffering and it's not </v>

692
00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:56.950
<v Speaker 1>the imposition of an ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

693
00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.510
<v Speaker 1>And the idea behind this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of advice is you can try this too.</v>

694
00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.400
<v Speaker 1>You wake up in the morning and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

695
00:39:03.401 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could be a good day,</v>

696
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know,</v>

697
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:09.334
<v Speaker 1>right what a good day is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you've had a couple and </v>

698
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:12.160
<v Speaker 1>they're not so bad.</v>

699
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.980
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you think you could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>another one but you don't know.</v>

700
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:15.814
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

701
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.310
<v Speaker 1>you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is meditative.</v>

702
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.150
<v Speaker 1>What is it that I need to do today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that this would be a good day.</v>

703
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.310
<v Speaker 1>And your brain will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll say,</v>

704
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.293
<v Speaker 1>you know that build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hiding under five pieces of paper </v>

705
00:39:26.891 --> 00:39:27.724
<v Speaker 1>on your desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should hall that sucker out and pay </v>

706
00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:29.824
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or there's something you're avoiding </v>

707
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:34.020
<v Speaker 1>that makes you anxious that your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>will pick on right away.</v>

708
00:39:34.021 --> 00:39:38.560
<v Speaker 1>And it'll say you have to do these </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever number of commitments today.</v>

709
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:42.400
<v Speaker 1>And if you do them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you fulfilled your obligations.</v>

710
00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:43.923
<v Speaker 1>And the idea behind this piece of advice</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you fulfill your obligations </v>

711
00:39:46.661 --> 00:39:47.494
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to worry about the </v>

712
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:51.190
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very interesting idea.</v>

713
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.173
<v Speaker 1>And it's predicated on the notion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a wisdom inside people that </v>

714
00:39:54.581 --> 00:39:55.414
<v Speaker 1>steeper than mere rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe that to be the case </v>

715
00:39:58.511 --> 00:39:59.344
<v Speaker 1>because we're far older than mere </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality from an evolutionary </v>

716
00:40:02.921 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from any perspective you want.</v>

717
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:06.243
<v Speaker 1>We're deeper than rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know old psychologists have </v>

718
00:40:09.371 --> 00:40:10.204
<v Speaker 1>learned in the last 20 years that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality is bounded ridiculously and </v>

719
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:15.580
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the master,</v>

720
00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:18.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a servant and it's an unruly </v>
<v Speaker 1>servant.</v>

721
00:40:18.071 --> 00:40:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Even though it can be a very powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

722
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:21.003
<v Speaker 1>That totality of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom that's embodied in the </v>

723
00:40:22.961 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 1>totality of you is far outstrips </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality.</v>

724
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:26.943
<v Speaker 1>And if you listen to yourself and do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult things that you're self tells </v>

725
00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:31.084
<v Speaker 1>you to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is you don't have to compute </v>

726
00:40:33.611 --> 00:40:34.444
<v Speaker 1>the Utopian future because following </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that you tell yourself to do </v>

727
00:40:37.751 --> 00:40:41.410
<v Speaker 1>every moment is the best path to </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the best outcome is.</v>

728
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:45.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a strange way of thinking because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a utopian and a rationalist,</v>

729
00:40:45.911 --> 00:40:46.744
<v Speaker 1>you already know what the right outcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>is and then you have to run around </v>

730
00:40:48.971 --> 00:40:49.804
<v Speaker 1>pointing guns at people to make bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that they do the right thing so </v>

731
00:40:52.571 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>that the outcome you've computed ochres </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't seem to work very well.</v>

732
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:57.723
<v Speaker 1>And so you see this idea in Taoism too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is to give up the end because </v>

733
00:41:02.981 --> 00:41:04.990
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what it is and you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

734
00:41:04.991 --> 00:41:06.940
<v Speaker 1>It's an admission of ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you headed?</v>

735
00:41:06.941 --> 00:41:07.774
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be </v>

736
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:09.784
<v Speaker 1>headed somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Follow your moral intuitions stopped </v>

737
00:41:13.921 --> 00:41:16.600
<v Speaker 1>doing the things that make you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>weak.</v>

738
00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about following a moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>code,</v>

739
00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:19.894
<v Speaker 1>although that can come into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really don't know what the hell </v>

740
00:41:21.881 --> 00:41:22.714
<v Speaker 1>you're doing at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then following a moral code is a good </v>

741
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:27.130
<v Speaker 1>idea because it'll at least get the ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling.</v>

742
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of apprenticeship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

743
00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:30.754
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing the obviously bad things is a </v>

744
00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:36.270
<v Speaker 1>form of discipline and it isn't the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

745
00:41:36.271 --> 00:41:39.440
<v Speaker 1>the notion that I'm talking about now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a different thing.</v>

746
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:41.563
<v Speaker 1>This is</v>

747
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.010
<v Speaker 1>bay attention to what's meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can see what that is.</v>

748
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:46.844
<v Speaker 1>You may find you're terrified of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody's got this little </v>

749
00:41:48.591 --> 00:41:52.340
<v Speaker 1>secret wish I really love doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

750
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.230
<v Speaker 1>It's different things for different </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

751
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.540
<v Speaker 1>but they're afraid to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really do it.</v>

752
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as you do what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really love,</v>

753
00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 1>then you expose your nakedness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

754
00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:02.330
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm really like.</v>

755
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.313
<v Speaker 1>Instead you just shove that under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed and you do something you don't care </v>

756
00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:07.240
<v Speaker 1>about at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if people judge you,</v>

757
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:09.500
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is you,</v>

758
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.120
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no life there.</v>

759
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:15.140
<v Speaker 1>There's no force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no you and without that,</v>

760
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.710
<v Speaker 1>the suffering will do you in and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll become a bad person.</v>

761
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a good thing.</v>

762
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

763
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.320
<v Speaker 1>So you have to see what it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find meaningful,</v>

764
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.780
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to fight for it.</v>

765
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.823
<v Speaker 1>You have to fight against yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to fight against other people </v>

766
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.990
<v Speaker 1>because what do they know about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to fight against.</v>

767
00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Nature may be even to stand up for what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that sustains you.</v>

768
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.590
<v Speaker 1>And that takes courage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also takes honesty,</v>

769
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 1>partly because if you're not honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't trust your own intuition.</v>

770
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:45.014
<v Speaker 1>So this is an important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about this and this is why </v>

771
00:42:47.751 --> 00:42:48.584
<v Speaker 1>virtue is a necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you lie to yourself or to other </v>

772
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:55.070
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you</v>

773
00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

774
00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you corrupt the structure that you use </v>
<v Speaker 1>to interact with being.</v>

775
00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.920
<v Speaker 1>You corrupt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you corrupt it,</v>

776
00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.150
<v Speaker 1>then if you listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will guide you the wrong way.</v>

777
00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it will be so corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't listen to it at all.</v>

778
00:43:12.761 --> 00:43:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to listen to somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that might not be a good thing,</v>

779
00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.430
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're already corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you'll listen to the person</v>

780
00:43:21.431 --> 00:43:23.980
<v Speaker 1>who tells you to do what you really want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

781
00:43:23.981 --> 00:43:24.814
<v Speaker 1>But won't admit it to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that explains how Hitler found all </v>

782
00:43:28.931 --> 00:43:32.560
<v Speaker 1>his followers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They abandoned their own motive being it</v>

783
00:43:32.561 --> 00:43:37.561
<v Speaker 1>made the bitter and resentful and empty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hollow and weak and cruel,</v>

784
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.390
<v Speaker 1>and then they trained their leader to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them what they wanted to hear.</v>

785
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.400
<v Speaker 1>If you're honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is painful,</v>

786
00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.400
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that a lot of things you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't real.</v>

787
00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.710
<v Speaker 1>You'll see a lot of things that you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you weak.</v>

788
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:54.903
<v Speaker 1>You'll see that a lot of people you </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with are probably not good </v>

789
00:43:57.071 --> 00:43:57.904
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have a lot of difficult </v>

790
00:43:59.531 --> 00:44:00.364
<v Speaker 1>choices to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can stop with the obvious lying </v>

791
00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:04.323
<v Speaker 1>that'll clear things up for you a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can start communicating with </v>

792
00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:08.374
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I teach my clients is </v>

793
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:13.390
<v Speaker 1>if you're resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say something about it.</v>

794
00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Say something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell the person,</v>

795
00:44:15.401 --> 00:44:16.234
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

796
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:17.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

797
00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.420
<v Speaker 1>what you asked me to do is making me </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful.</v>

798
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:20.583
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're your wife or husband or </v>

799
00:44:21.281 --> 00:44:22.114
<v Speaker 1>someone you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should listen to them because they </v>

800
00:44:23.051 --> 00:44:24.490
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

801
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:25.383
<v Speaker 1>grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take your damn responsibility and leave </v>

802
00:44:27.311 --> 00:44:29.560
<v Speaker 1>me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe,</v>

803
00:44:29.561 --> 00:44:33.210
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they're right or maybe they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a bully and you have to say,</v>

804
00:44:33.211 --> 00:44:34.044
<v Speaker 1>quit pushing me around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you have to have an </v>

805
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:37.410
<v Speaker 1>argument with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an honest argument where you say,</v>

806
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:38.880
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's happening to me.</v>

807
00:44:38.881 --> 00:44:39.571
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

808
00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:40.404
<v Speaker 1>this is what's happening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you battle it out until you reach </v>

809
00:44:43.231 --> 00:44:44.064
<v Speaker 1>some sort of settlement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you don't have to be resentful </v>

810
00:44:45.271 --> 00:44:47.970
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you won't be mean and cruel,</v>

811
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.360
<v Speaker 1>vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to be honest in order to do</v>

812
00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:52.194
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

813
00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about error.</v>

814
00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:58.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't exactly know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

815
00:44:58.121 --> 00:45:00.280
<v Speaker 1>So how do you get to the point where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you're doing?</v>

816
00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.593
<v Speaker 1>I think follow your internal intuitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be honest about it and know what will </v>

817
00:45:04.301 --> 00:45:09.301
<v Speaker 1>happen is a star will appear and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>guide you and the star is whatever makes</v>

818
00:45:09.371 --> 00:45:10.204
<v Speaker 1>your life meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you'll take some tentative </v>

819
00:45:12.401 --> 00:45:15.820
<v Speaker 1>steps in that direction and you'll get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little ways and you'll think,</v>

820
00:45:15.821 --> 00:45:16.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

821
00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:21.070
<v Speaker 1>And then the thing that makes you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful will appear over there.</v>

822
00:45:21.071 --> 00:45:23.530
<v Speaker 1>And then you take a few tentative steps </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that direction,</v>

823
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.110
<v Speaker 1>but as you step and walk towards these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

824
00:45:26.111 --> 00:45:28.240
<v Speaker 1>you change and as you change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get wiser.</v>

825
00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:29.283
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is if you keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>following these things that make your </v>

826
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:34.300
<v Speaker 1>life meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you correct yourself across time.</v>

827
00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.093
<v Speaker 1>You see the thing there and that's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see it there and that's wrong </v>

828
00:45:38.021 --> 00:45:40.080
<v Speaker 1>and you see it there and that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you keep chasing it.</v>

829
00:45:40.081 --> 00:45:43.030
<v Speaker 1>It as you chase it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move forward and as you move forward</v>

830
00:45:43.031 --> 00:45:43.864
<v Speaker 1>and you do things and you learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mistakes because you're honest and </v>

831
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:47.274
<v Speaker 1>you're watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get wiser and wiser and the </v>

832
00:45:49.391 --> 00:45:50.224
<v Speaker 1>consequence of all those mistakes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll self correct the mistakes and 20 </v>

833
00:45:52.991 --> 00:45:55.630
<v Speaker 1>years down the road maybe you won't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>making so many mistakes.</v>

834
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:58.870
<v Speaker 1>They say it takes 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours to be an expert at something.</v>

835
00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.513
<v Speaker 1>So you would need 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours of practice following what it is </v>

836
00:46:03.641 --> 00:46:04.840
<v Speaker 1>that you need to follow.</v>

837
00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to close with two things.</v>

838
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

839
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.073
<v Speaker 1>I've come to the conclusion as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of studying the things I've </v>

840
00:46:15.721 --> 00:46:16.554
<v Speaker 1>been telling you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that belief has a religious </v>

841
00:46:18.031 --> 00:46:18.864
<v Speaker 1>substructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go all the way down into </v>

842
00:46:20.071 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 1>someone's belief structure right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>

843
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.090
<v Speaker 1>what you find or religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions,</v>

844
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.190
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person might not agree,</v>

845
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think generally people don't know.</v>

846
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Here's an old religious presuppositions </v>
<v Speaker 1>older than Christianity.</v>

847
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:40.110
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed Christianity is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful proponent of this viewpoint.</v>

848
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.153
<v Speaker 1>There's a heaven and there's a hell and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should live your life so that you </v>

849
00:46:44.521 --> 00:46:45.354
<v Speaker 1>end up in one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happened to Christianity is that </v>

850
00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that's an afterlife thing.</v>

851
00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is an afterlife thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a now thing.</v>

852
00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.290
<v Speaker 1>I see people who are in hell all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

853
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.320
<v Speaker 1>You can see them if you walked down </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bluer Street,</v>

854
00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.230
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

855
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:06.630
<v Speaker 1>it's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you walk by someone in Hell,</v>

856
00:47:06.631 --> 00:47:08.970
<v Speaker 1>you can't look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't look at them.</v>

857
00:47:08.971 --> 00:47:10.590
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll give them a wide berth.</v>

858
00:47:10.591 --> 00:47:12.240
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at them and you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at them,</v>

859
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.313
<v Speaker 1>they'll either become aggressive or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ashamed because they do not want you to </v>

860
00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:18.570
<v Speaker 1>see where they are because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to see where they are.</v>

861
00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

862
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:20.963
<v Speaker 1>And by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heaven's a real place to and now and </v>

863
00:47:23.251 --> 00:47:24.084
<v Speaker 1>then you're in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't notice because you don't </v>

864
00:47:25.201 --> 00:47:28.320
<v Speaker 1>believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an old Gospel,</v>

865
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Gnostic Gospel that was dug up in 1957 </v>
<v Speaker 1>he gospel of Thomas and in the Gospel of</v>

866
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:33.964
<v Speaker 1>autonomous Christ says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kingdom of Heaven is spread out on </v>

867
00:47:36.551 --> 00:47:38.860
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but men do not see it.</v>

868
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.210
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that's a metaphor or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it is a metaphor,</v>

869
00:47:43.211 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a deep metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that life,</v>

870
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:49.990
<v Speaker 1>human life is very expensive and we live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle.</v>

871
00:47:49.991 --> 00:47:50.824
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a mediocre middle often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at one extreme there's a hell and </v>

872
00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:54.724
<v Speaker 1>the other extreme is heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we bounced back and forth between </v>

873
00:47:56.621 --> 00:47:59.920
<v Speaker 1>them without really noticing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I could say,</v>

874
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:01.810
<v Speaker 1>well here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something to consider.</v>

875
00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:06.670
<v Speaker 1>If the things you're doing are landing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you inhale stop.</v>

876
00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want to be there.</v>

877
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.660
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think you,</v>

878
00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:13.100
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is think about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life over the last year,</v>

879
00:48:13.101 --> 00:48:13.934
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be certain that you can call to </v>

880
00:48:15.281 --> 00:48:19.240
<v Speaker 1>mind times when you would have rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>that did not happen.</v>

881
00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:23.950
<v Speaker 1>And so the lesson from that is clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't set up those conditions anymore.</v>

882
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.870
<v Speaker 1>And by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch yourself,</v>

883
00:48:25.871 --> 00:48:27.640
<v Speaker 1>you can tell when you're where you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

884
00:48:27.641 --> 00:48:28.361
<v Speaker 1>And I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

885
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:31.720
<v Speaker 1>if you're where you want to be and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really the right place,</v>

886
00:48:31.721 --> 00:48:34.930
<v Speaker 1>then all you should ever do is practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be there.</v>

887
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.810
<v Speaker 1>The Kingdom of Heaven is spread out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>

888
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:38.644
<v Speaker 1>but men do not see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what I would say about </v>

889
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:41.614
<v Speaker 1>virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virtue first is the attempt to see that </v>

890
00:48:44.591 --> 00:48:47.710
<v Speaker 1>heaven and it's a questioning thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

891
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's the same for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

892
00:48:49.331 --> 00:48:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that at all because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are individuals just to see it.</v>

893
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing is to attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in it.</v>

894
00:48:58.570 --> 00:48:59.403
<v Speaker 1>And I truly believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe that there is nothing </v>

895
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:07.830
<v Speaker 1>that you can do that's better for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only for yourself,</v>

896
00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:15.020
<v Speaker 1>but for everyone that you interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of you know your potential.</v>

897
00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:20.180
<v Speaker 1>People are amazing creatures that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that people can be a Biz mully</v>

898
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.613
<v Speaker 2>awful,</v>

899
00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.670
<v Speaker 1>but they can be as remarkably good as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

900
00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

901
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Bismilaahi awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's rare,</v>

902
00:49:28.111 --> 00:49:33.111
<v Speaker 1>but it's not beyond the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

903
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:36.700
<v Speaker 1>What's a human possibility?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

904
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.690
<v Speaker 1>no one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's,</v>

905
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:39.903
<v Speaker 1>it's near infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know nothing about our own being or </v>

906
00:49:42.181 --> 00:49:44.940
<v Speaker 1>about our relationship with the totality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>

907
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:48.303
<v Speaker 1>We may occupy a more important place </v>
<v Speaker 1>than we all think and the consequences </v>

908
00:49:53.051 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 1>of our actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our virtues or our lack thereof.</v>

909
00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Echo may echo far beyond what we want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>

910
00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:08.490
<v Speaker 1>So I would say try to find out what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

911
00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Just watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't listen to anybody else.</v>

912
00:50:15.271 --> 00:50:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'll give you some hints,</v>

913
00:50:17.401 --> 00:50:18.234
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to sort it out for </v>

914
00:50:19.021 --> 00:50:19.854
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you find out what's good for </v>

915
00:50:22.201 --> 00:50:24.690
<v Speaker 1>you and what isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the things that are good for you.</v>

916
00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:29.060
