Speaker 1:          00:04          Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:06          so people are possessed by a question. It's part of our nature to be possessed by this question and so you can think about this as an architectural question if you like, and the question is what are we doing here? And you can ask yourself that in relationship to this conference. You're here to search for meaning and to understand what that might mean, but you also might ask yourself, well, why is it that you have to be here for your search for meaning? Why is that something that drives human beings? It doesn't characteristic. For example, of animals, they don't seem to question their existence, so there's something about the very nature of human being that makes us feel as if something needs to be set right. When that's been discussed historically, it's been associated with the term redemption. People are in need of redemption in the modern age. We talk about positive psychology and we talk about happiness, which is a much weaker word, but our forefathers had a more profound sense of the problematic state of human existence and they use more profound words and the idea that we have a need for redemption is a more profound idea.

Speaker 2:          01:36          Human beings, and I'm going to talk mostly about human beings in the West because that's the literature that I'm most familiar with. Human beings in the West have been meditating on the nature of human beings for thousands of years perhaps ever since we became self conscious, which is another thing that distinguishes us from animals and another thing that drives our search for meaning. The consequence of this meditation or one of the consequences of this meditation has been the production of a series of books that people know is the Bible. I realized years ago that people saw the world through lenses of belief and more recently it's been demonstrated that that's actually inevitable because you're a limited cognitive processor. You have to frame your perceptions with beliefs. What I learned is that the belief systems that people use to frame their perceptions have a structure and that structure is religious, so religious presupposition is one that you you might even know not noticed that you make. It's it's a predicate or an axiom or an assumption, and the study of those axiomatic assumptions is what religion is about and one of your axiomatic assumptions, for example, is that life involves a search for meaning and that's associated with the idea of redemption and you. You'll notice that you asked that question because of course you're here, but you might not notice how strange it is that all of you asked that question and the fact that all of you asked that question that human beings have asked that question for as far back as we can understand, is indicative of something profound about human nature. It's lack of completion.

Speaker 2:          03:34          I'm going to walk you through the series of stories that make up this library of books known as the Bible because it presents a theory of redemption. That in a sense is emergent. It's a consequence of this insanely complicated, cross-generational meditation on the nature of being. It's not designed by any one person.

Speaker 2:          04:05          It's designed by processes that we don't really understand because we don't know anything about how books are written over thousands of years or what forces caused them to be compiled into a certain way or what narrative direction they tend to take. Now, one of the things that's strange about the Bible, given that it's a collection of books, is that it actually has a narrative structure. It has a story and that story's been cobbled together. It's, it's like it's emerged out of the depths. It's not a top down story. It's a bottom up story. Then I suppose that's why many of the world's major religions regard the Bible as a book that was revealed rather than one that was written. It's a perfectly reasonable presupposition that it's revealed because it's not the consequence of the work of anyone author. It's not written according to a plan or not a plan that we can understand, but nonetheless it has a structure. It also has a strange structure in that it's full of stories that no one can forgive, but that also that no one can understand and the combination of incomprehensible and unforgettable is a very strange combination and of course that combination is basically mythological,

Speaker 2:          05:15          so I'm going to start out by telling you what genesis has to say about why it is that you need to search for meaning.

Speaker 2:          05:24          Nope. People are pretty familiar as a general rule with the basic stories in genesis. Genesis starts out with the word of God creating being from chaos. That's a very complicated idea. The idea is that whatever the word is, which is logos from a, from a Christian perspective, from a Western perspective, that logos, which is something like consciousness and something like speech, has the power to pull order out of an underlying chaos. Now we do this all the time. People do this all the time. That's I suppose in some sense, white were hypothetically made in the image of God. We use our consciousness to constantly construct being out of chaos and according to the initial opening of genesis. There's something about that that's akin to the construction of the world, and so that means that from the perspective of this book, consciousness itself plays a world constructing role. It's got a central place and human beings in some sense, parties participate in that in some minor sense I suppose, but in a sense that not nonetheless makes them akin to what the library books called the Bible assumes his daddy and one squad

Speaker 2:          06:41          logos extracts order out of chaos. He builds a little world and it populates it, and then in the little world he puts a garden, a walled garden, Paradise. It's paradise means walled garden or Eden. Eden means well watered place and you might think, well, why had garden? And the answer to that is a garden is the optimal combination of nature and culture or chaos and order because the garden is where nature flourishes, but it's also where nature flourishes in a, in a safe and controlled environment. And so that's like an optimal environment for people and so there's a garden. God puts the people in there and that's optimal. When he warns them, he says, this is a strange thing. He says, well, now you're in the garden. That's where you should live and there's something you shouldn't do and what you shouldn't do is eat a particular fruit. Now I'm going to tell you something about vision.

Speaker 2:          07:43          Human beings have excellent vision. First of all, we see color, hardly any creature see color, but we do and not only do we see color, but our vision is tremendously acute. The only other animals that can see as well as us or birds of prey for mammals, man, we can see like you wouldn't believe and and for primates as well as we can see much better than our closest primate relatives and why that is is a bit of mystery, but there's a woman in California who seems perhaps to absolve that her name is Lynne Isbell and she was very interested in how human beings develop vision and she's interested in patterns of Predation Predator prey relationships, and she knew that our treed dwelling ancestors millions of years ago, were frequently preyed upon by snakes. In fact, there's some evidence that are tree dwelling ancestors and snakes, coal evolved, and that our visual system is particularly good at picking up the patterns of camouflage that snakes used to hide in trees or in the undergrowth, and what Isabelle showed was that if you looked at primate populations around the world where there were more predatory snakes, the primates could see better. It's a very high correlation, and so she concluded that the reason that human beings can see so well is because of snakes.

Speaker 2:          09:14          Now she thought the association between that and the snake story in genesis was interestingly coincidental, but it's much more than that. No, we don't know how the Adam and Eve story came about. We know it's very ancient, but there's something about it that sticks in our memory and in our culture, and the reason for that seems to be that in some strange way, it's an extraordinarily accurate summation. Snakes gave us vision. What about fruit? Lot of the reason we can see colors is because our visual system evolved to detect ripe fruit. What about women?

Speaker 2:          09:57          Well, you have to be pretty waked out a woman, so there's this weird interconnection in genesis between women, fruit and snakes, and the idea is that the interplay between the three you remember women are gatherers to or were gatherers historically speaking and they shared food with men and that's a strange thing because human beings share food and hardly any other animals do and so women didn't tempt men with fruit and they didn't make them self conscious along with the snake and the fruit, and that was a catastrophe. What happens in genesis is that when people become self conscious, when they eat the fruit, their vision improves. The scales fall from their eyes and all of a sudden they can see in a way that no other animal has ever seen and one of the things they can see is that they're naked and that's a big problem.

Speaker 2:          10:51          And you might ask, well, what does being naked? Meaning? That's quite straightforward. People often dream, for example, of being naked in front of a crowd and to be naked in front of a crowd is to have all your frailties and vulnerabilities revealed to judgment. And that's a nightmare for people and so to become self aware is to wake up into a nightmare and the nightmare involves a profound realization, no individual vulnerability and the consequence of that in genesis is that people are banished from paradise and are from then on in need of redemption and that they have to work and that's how man comes to be in a fallen state and you don't have a need for redemption or need for meaning or request after meaning unless you're in a fallen state and everyone is strangely enough, has this intuition that they're in a fallen state, that something is wrong with the world that needs to be put right and and more that or something is wrong with being. It needs to be put right. And more than that, that in some weird sense, weird way. They have a moral obligation to participate in that process and that drives us like it's beneath what drives us. It's an axiomatic presupposition. The next thing that happens in genesis is that Abel and Cain are born and they're really the first two human beings because

Speaker 2:          12:22          Adam and eve are made by God. Whereas Cain and Abel are born there, they're the first people that are born in history

Speaker 1:          12:29          and

Speaker 2:          12:30          interestingly enough, what happens between Cain and Abel, which is jealous, resentment against God, followed by murder, is the first pattern of behavior that human beings manifest. Once they become self conscious. That's an awful story and it's a prototypical story in a sense because what it says is that there are two patterns of reaction to tragic selfconsciousness and one is associated with a murderer, a state of resentment, resentment towards life. The kind of murderous resentment that drove the killer in Colorado, for example, murderous resentment against life and the other typified by Abel has something to do with the establishment of the antithesis of murderous resentment. So you can associate murderous resentment in a sense with hell and you can associate ables path his choices with heaven. And so what happens is that as soon as people become self conscious, being divides into a domain that has held on one on one end and heaven on another, and that's when we hinted that in the second story in genesis.

Speaker 2:          13:40          After that, everything dissolves into a flood. That's Noah. Into a flood, nature comes in, tears, everything down and the Tower of Babel is erected and that's a meditation on pride. People build a structure that's reaches up to where God is. It's a presumptuous act and there's there's a reason for that too. One of the consistent warnings that emerges in the biblical writings, his warnings against the sin of pride and the sin of pride is an intellectual sin and it's associated with the presupposition that you know enough to do without the transcendent and the biblical story state very, very clearly continually that that is catastrophic, dangerous, that you always have to be aware that there's something transcendent that supersedes the domain of your knowledge

Speaker 1:          14:31          and and

Speaker 2:          14:33          and what, what might you think of people who, who don't believe that well are totalitarians because they believed that their belief is total and we know what happens when people become totalitarian. What happens is you get the instant creation of something on earth that very closely resembles hell and that was hammered home in the 20th century. If you want to derive one lesson from the 20th century, it's the totalitarian states and totalitarian ideologies are not a good way to entrap or or search after meaning. That's a mistake

Speaker 2:          15:16          after the flood. The flood is before the flood. That's prehistory. That's so far back in time. We can't even imagine it after the flood. There's A. There's a new beginning in a sense, and that's when history really starts from a biblical perspective and the way the Old Testament lays itself out then is that it's kind of a classic hero myth, a hero myth. It's associated with the establishment of states and generally speaking, when when societies mythologize the beginning of their state, they imagine a set of heroes. It's sort of happening with people like George Washington in the United States. It happens automatically if the founders of the state, our state, our mythologized as of the great heroes of the past. It's the great heroes of the past. Our forefathers who established the state, and of course that's true and there were millions of them, but you can't tell a story about millions of people. So all the actions of those millions of people are collapsed and condensed and compressed and turned it into a kind of fiction that's more real than truth, that describes the patterns that characterize how the state was founded and the Old Testament runs us through that. The heroes like Abraham for example, and Jacob who are crucially involved in the establishment of the policy of the actual state,

Speaker 2:          16:38          but something always happens as this state is established and what happens is the states established and then people get off course and the leadership gets off course and then the state collapses into a state of chaos, and then there's a prophetic revelation warning of that danger, and then there's a terrible period of chaotic disruption, and then there's the regeneration of the state. That story is foreshadowed in the Old Testament by Exodus Moses story. Egypt's a tyranny. A leader rises to pull everyone out of tyranny. There is a terrible chaotic interlude. The wandering in the desert, and then there's the reestablishment of the state.

Speaker 2:          17:32          That's an archetypal pattern that happens to all of you. It happens to every country in the pattern is here in your system of belief which is yours in the collective belief and something arises like a snake and now it gets to a snake to disrupt it because the state is insufficiently adapted to the environment. It doesn't have all the answers. It ages and becomes corrupt, and then it's prone to collapse and that collapses a catastrophe. Okay. Audit catastrophe that happens to you every time, for example, that your dreams are shattered or that you encounter a great tragedy. It happens to people when their spouse dies or when they're diagnosed with a very, very dangerous illness or when their children are damaged. That event analogous, as I said to a snake, and that's partly because the circuits in your brain that detects snakes that other animals use to detect snakes are the same circuits that we use to detect things that go wrong and things are always going wrong for us and we're always collapsing into a state where we're wandering through a desert and the desert is a state that's bereft of meaning and bereft of ideas and in that state then we're desperately seeking for while for the establishment of another state and a state that we hope will be a better state. It'll be like the last date, except there'll be more to it and everyone will finally be happy and that that's part of our Utopian dream

Speaker 2:          19:05          and it's impossible not to be in that story. You're either in a state of order or you're in a state of chaos. That's where the Dallas, for example, believed that the world is made out of order and chaos is because you're always in one of those two places. What happens in the old testament is that the limitations of the state itself start to become apparent and they become apparent in that the state has established, but it always collapses and then it's reestablished, but it always collapses. It's never permanent, and and there's repetitions of this continual repetitions of this and not out of the Old Testament. At least the way that it's been constructed in Christianity is that the state itself is flawed. It cannot provide. The final answer to the question, what constitutes genuine redemption?

Speaker 2:          20:03          Well, this is an important issue. It's an important issue. Psychologically. It's an important issue. Politically is the state. The final answer, well, it's a totalitarian claim. We know that it was claimed by people like Stella. It was certainly claimed by the communists. It was claimed by people like Hitler that the state was. The final answer is still claimed in many ways in places like China. Today, the is subsumed underneath the state organization in this state, well, under Schell in the state was already in a state of perfection. If you complained about its imperfection, then you were going to be killed. So the idea that the state is perfect, although it's a tremendously flawed idea, can be pursued so hard, people who are gripping their narrow viewpoints that the state itself becomes murderous. The Old Testament sorta sums itself up in the book of job and it's a problematic summing up because joe is tormented in all sorts of ways. Everything that could possibly be terrible that happens to any person happens to job and he can't understand why so job is in like a final state of unredeemed being the states, not the answer

Speaker 2:          21:20          well, so then if being is order being is chaos and chaos is intolerable and the state order is not the answer, what do you have left? That's the question the new testament attempts to solve. One of the problems with with the Soviet Union, for example, was their inability to correct errors. See, when you start out with an a priori hypothesis about what constitutes the truth and that structures your life, it's very difficult to make the kind of micro corrections that estate has to make on a continual basis in order to remain dynamic and fluid. So in order to stay adaptive to reality, not only do you have to have a viewpoint, but you have to engage in a process of modifying that viewpoint and the way that you engage in the process of modifying that viewpoint. There's two ways really. One is continual minor adjustments as a consequence of paying attention.

Speaker 2:          22:17          So for example, if you're having a conversation with your wife or a friend, or maybe it's a difficult conversation, there's a couple of ways that conversation can go. One is you can take your viewpoint and you can impose it on that person, and often when people are talking, that's what they're trying to do. They're not having a conversation. What they're doing is attempting to impose a viewpoint that they already hold the ear on the person that's listening and if they're a tyrant or a bully, they'll do that and pay no attention whatsoever to the person's response and in fact, they'll get irritated and even violent if the person doesn't accept. There are a priority. Framing

Speaker 2:          22:49          is there an alternative? Mother is an alternative. The alternative is to pay attention and to listen on the off chance that the person that you're talking to might tell you something you don't know, but in order to listen, you have to be already convinced that the little theory that you're using to orient yourself in the world isn't good enough because if it was good enough, then why would you bother listening? So you have to be deeply aware of your own ignorance and that's what humility means. Humility means to be deeply aware of your own ignorance. It doesn't mean to slink around in and ashamed manner. It means to make the presupposition that you may still have something left to learn and that this annoying person in front of you might have something to teach you if you would just listen and so you're discussing a problem and a problem.

Speaker 2:          23:37          Is this a time when the things you think aren't working? That's what constitutes a problem. So we have a little problem and you're discussing it. Let's with your wife and she offers you her opinion and you can brush it off and in which case your little state stays intact. It doesn't move, it's still made out of stone. It's pillars and you're still a tyrant or you can listen. You can think, oh, I see there, there's a micro correction that I need to make in one of the peripheral elements of my belief, and that's a little painful because it means you have to let something go, your your, your presumption, and then you have to be a little chaotic as you adjust to the new information and then you have to reconstitute yourself, and what that means interestingly enough, is that you have to make a sacrifice.

Speaker 2:          24:24          God likes sacrifices, especially if they're of the proper kind and the proper kind of sacrifices, the one that you made of your micro belief. When you're faced with evidence of error, and if you make those sorts of micro sacrifices, then God stays pleased with you and the reason for that is that your models of the world stay up to date. Now, one of the things that happened in the old testament all the time is that people are making sacrifices to God and modern people. They just have no idea what I like. Why does God want burnt lamb smoke? It's not obvious to modern people, but you know you, your ancestors were stupid. They were dramatizing something. They were dramatizing this tremendous realization, but no other creature has ever managed, which is that there are things you can do to your being that change the nature of reality and if you do them properly, you can make reality better. It's mind boggling and they acted that out because they didn't really understand it. They noticed that if things weren't going right, you had to sacrifice something valuable and that seemed to make God happy. Well, it might've been a firstborn calf or firstborn son for that matter, for modern people. It's more like an idea. You have to sacrifice an idea that you hold dear in order to progress because the ideas that you hold dear are exactly what are making you suffer. If you're suffering

Speaker 2:          25:50          so you have to sacrifice them and then you have to let them go, and the consequences of that is that you enter into this little period of chaos and then maybe you pop out of that and that's a good thing, and so here's an interesting observation. That process of being in the state and identifying an error and correcting it, that's a little death and rebirth. That's like the Phoenix. The Phoenix dissolved itself into ashes and then pops back up as a. As a new bird

Speaker 2:          26:21          in the new testament, there's this weird idea for that. You have to identify with a person who continually dies in his reward or what does that mean? It means that the idea that redemption itself is not the consequences of being in a state. It's the consequence of participating in a process and the process is the willingness to continually have yourself sacrificed, chaotic and then reward, and that's what keeps things alive. Now, in the, in the passion story, there are other elements and the elements are important. So for example, the story of Christ is predicated on the assumption that the person who is making the ultimate sacrifices performance another, a number of acts or undergoes a number of processes and one is a disciplined apprenticeship. So for example, in order to have some ideas that you can let go and then reconstitute, you have to have some ideas.

Speaker 2:          27:28          You can't just be all chaotic and uninformed and so in the New Testament, Christ is a master of tradition. He's a master of the law and you have to be disciplined. You have to be a master of something before you're formed at all. You have to be imbued with the spirit of your ancestors will say. You have to take on that. That burden. You see this reflected in popular culture. For example, in the Movie Pinocchio, at the end of the movie when Pinocchio is about to become a real boy, his last challenge is to rescue his father and he does that and to rescue the father means to make peace with your culture and to embody it. But then not to assume that that's absolute. It's a necessary process of discipline. The next idea that underlies the passion ideas in the new testament is that the ultimate sacrifice is the sacrifice of yourself to God. Now, that's a very strange idea and it's a very, very sophisticated idea because what happens in the old testament is there's the constant sacrificing of something else. This requires a different order of being. What does it mean to offer yourself up as a sacrifice to God? Well

Speaker 2:          28:52          can think of God as an inevitable representation of the highest possible value. That's what monotheistic pursue memory, presumed God's nameable. Even the Israelites presumed that garden wasn't nameable. It's inevitable, but it's the ultimate value. Whatever the ultimate value is, you don't know what it is, but you've got to have some idea and the idea of offering yourself up as a sacrifice to God is the same thing as determining that your life will be guided by unshakable commitment to the highest good, and what that means is that it's no longer your state that's in charger. It's no longer your ego that's in charge. It's not even you that's in charge. It means that your conversations with people who are no longer going to be about convincing them that your viewpoint is a right. It means that what your conversation is going to be about in your speech about attempting to represent what you believe to be true in the most concise and clear possible manner no matter what,

Speaker 2:          29:52          and that's not how people live. People live in a sense by. It's like a conniving and the conniving is a totalitarian, conniving. The conniving is an idea that the world shouldn't be the way that I wanted to be. I have a theory about how I want it to be and I'm going to enforce that theory and I'm going to be very angry when the world doesn't respond the way I wanted to and maybe even be violent as a consequence of it and I have some sense of where I'm headed. I'm headed for wealth for example, and I'm headed to an advertisement. So I'm with my wife when I'm 50 on a tropical beach and that's how I'm going to be redeemed. And it's a narrow and totalitarian viewpoint. And then I sacrificed everything to that and it turns out that that's a very bad idea because things don't turn out the way I want them to turn out and the alternative to that, and this is part of what happens in the sermon on the mount, which is very, very strange document because it represents a transformation from the idea that morality is constituted by adherence to a set of rules to morality being aimed at something that you might think about as more of a positive good.

Speaker 2:          30:59          It's not merely not doing what's wrong, it's something else. It's sacrificing yourself in the attempt to make things better and making things better. Not by aiming at what's better, but by telling what's true and assuming that if you do that, then what's better will happen. Whatever that is, because the thing is you don't know what's better. You don't have the capacity to fully realize what would constitute better. When we've seen that, as I said, over and over in the 20th century, people aim at a circumscribed definition of what constitutes the Utopian state and all we get out of that is endless. Hell, we have to pursue what's good, but we don't know what's what. What's good is, so how do we, how do we remove ourselves from that paradox? Well, it isn't a matter of gathering more knowledge. It's a matter of approaching reality in a different manner and it is an act of faith, his character guard point to code because if you decide for example that you're going to pursue the highest good, whatever that is and the highest good, pursuing the highest good means. Being willing to transform what your conception of the highest good is.

Speaker 2:          32:09          You pursue the highest good. That's your aim. Your aim determines the world you live in. We know that that's a fact. That's a psychological fact. What you aim at determines the nature of your world and to aim wrong. That's hard. Markia by the way, that's a great word to a wrong that sin, because Hamartia, which is an archery term, which means to miss the target is what sin means. So if you're a not in a state of grace, it means your age wrong. Naming it the right thing, or maybe the world is constituted badly and it's hell bent on torturing you. That's the alternative viewpoint. You got to get your aim right. You name it the best, and how do you aim? Well, the sermon on the mount says something very interesting. It says, okay, what? You get your aim right and you decided to tell the truth. Then all you have to do is concentrate on the day.

Speaker 2:          33:04          Now people read the sermon on the mount. It's a hippy document. You know, be like a flower and be like a bird. Don't pay any attention to the future. You know everything will be taken care of. It's not that at all. There's presumptions that are nested in there and the presumption is, first of all, that you're aiming at at perfection. You're aiming at whatever perfection is and you're not trying to get other people to do that. You're aiming at it. You're reconstituting your actions and your speech to aim at that, and then you do that by noticing very carefully and attending to what constitutes the truth, and then you let that take you wherever it will go. And that's the sacrifice of self to God because you the truth is a representation of whatever constitutes reality, your best attempt at whatever constitutes reality and to follow that leans to follow something that's transcendent because whatever reality is, it's certainly not something that you're individually responsible for creating, even though you might participate in that process to speak. The truth is to be guided by being. It's a completely different motive being now I said right after Adam and Eve's catastrophic emergence into self consciousness, the world split into two attitudes, one associated with pain and the other associated with Abel can that those attitudes are associated with heaven and hell.

Speaker 2:          34:32          Well, we know that human beings can turn the world into help. If you're a student of history, you have no doubt about that and no matter how terrible you think the hell that people have created in the past is if you read a little more history, you will find something even more terrible. And people of course are afraid of the human capacity to turn things into hell. That that's one of the things that underlies our environmental, isn't. We're afraid that our misbehavior will turn the world into help, will be, we believe we can do that. Do we believe that human beings can turn the world into heaven? Well, that's a harder thing to believe it because there's a lot more ways that things could go wrong. Then there are ways that things can go right, so heaven's a much narrower thing to a map than hell, which is a chaotic mess.

Speaker 1:          35:25          Well,

Speaker 2:          35:27          maybe it's improbable, but life is improbable. That's for sure, and our unredeemed state of being is improbable and the other that's improbable is the burden that we're required to carry. Existentially, we're, we're awake creatures of God. What does that mean?

Speaker 2:          35:49          Oh, that we suffer and it's real that suffering, and it's not only that we suffer in that we feel pain, which is bad enough in frustration and disappointment and all of the catastrophic things that are associated with life, but even worse, we can apprehend the possibility of that recurring in the future. So even when none of those terrible things happen to be happening right now, it's pretty easy for us to imagine that they're going to happen tomorrow and they will. So not only can we imagine that they're going to happen again tomorrow, they are going to happen again tomorrow. So we're in a state of constant unredeemed suffering. It's a big problem. And you know, if you think about, you can't even imagine a state that would address that. It's just too big a problem. Well, so then there's another inference in the new testament and it's hypothesis of a metta state, and the inference is that a life that's predicated on constant death and renewal at every level of being a life that's predicated on a search for the truth and, and an attempt to act out the truth and our life that's associated with the sacrifice of self to God produces a state of being that so deeply meaningful that it justifies suffering, doesn't eliminate suffering. There's no elimination of suffering.

Speaker 2:          37:09          Nisha said he hasn't. He who has a why can bear any how and what he meant by that was if what you're aiming at is of sufficient profundity, it's worth an awful lot of misery to participate in the process of bringing it about and life has an unbearable depth of misery and as a consequence it needs a and observe positive aim and the observed positive aim. It's positive in the new testament. It is participation in the process that transforms earth into heaven, the generation of the Kingdom of God on earth, and that actually means something. It means that the state of being that is described by the parameters that I already laid out, the willingness to engage in Inter eternal sacrificial death and renewal and sacrifice of the self to the highest value produces a state of being subjectively that's associated with habitation in the Kingdom of God and the actions that are conducted in that state are what? Transform the interpersonal state into the political state. That's a manifestation of that kingdom. Now you all know this. You know this the same way that the people who wrote the Bible know what, because of course people just like you wrote the Bible in the Bible is about people. When you have a deeply meaningful conversation with someone,

Speaker 2:          39:13          you change them and you change yourself. You know that and the process that you're engaged in, while you have that deeply meaningful conversation, that's a mode of being and that motive being to the degree that that have motive being is predicated on the attempt to communicate as truthfully as possible and with the highest possible end in mind. Then right then and there, you're in that state. Now you can tell when you're in that state because number one, you're not self conscious. Time disappears. Number two, what you're engaged in is deeply meaningful. You don't bear the tragic burden of your life at that moment because what's happening with you is so worthwhile that it consumes you completely and people are in that state to a widely varying degree, but everyone is in it. Sometimes when something like that happens to you, especially once you learn to notice it,

Speaker 1:          40:26          you think

Speaker 2:          40:29          while there's nothing better than that, and if there's nothing better than that, then you might ask yourself, why do anything else now? I've tried to figure that out. I've tried to figure that out for years. It's like, because to me, these look like existential realities. They're not hypothetical states. They're not shoved off into some transcendent heaven. They're not other worldly. They're part of being itself. People can enter states of heaven and hell and they can learn to stay longer in one state or another, so why don't they stay in the best possible state?

Speaker 1:          41:16          Well,

Speaker 2:          41:19          one problem is the commitment of faith. I think it's very terrifying to let go of the direction of your life and say, well, I'm going to go wherever the attempt to speak the truth will pick me because God only knows where you're going to end up and it's certainly not where you think. In fact, the willingness to abandoned going to where you think is a prerequisite for doing this, and so in a sense you're. You're a ship that the wind takes wherever it wants to take, and the second problem I think is that it's a real responsibility because in order to undertake this process, you have to come to terms with the idea that what you do in your life, you're wretched, miserable, tragic prone life actually matters. Really it matters. You know when people complain about meaninglessness in their life all the time, but I think that's,

Speaker 2:          42:20          that's a kind of face saving illusion. I think people are more afraid of meaning than they are of meaninglessness because of meaningless means. Meaninglessness means, well, I can do whatever I want. I mean it might be kind of second rate and might be dull. It might be dangerous, it might be destructive, but it doesn't matter. So I can do whatever I want. I have no responsibility because I don't mean anything, so I'm not responsible to anything or anyone. But if your life actually has meaning and it doesn't always have meaning, it has meaning. When you're doing something that's meaningful, well then all of a sudden you are responsible to a higher power, so to speak. You're responsible to your own soul and you're responsible to the state of being that characterizes the world itself, and that's a massive, massive responsibility. It's to take responsibility in a sense. It's to take responsibility for the sins of the world, which is another prerequisite of the motive being that's described in the new testaments, a very strange idea. The redeemer takes on the sins of the world. What does that mean? Well, it means, oh, human beings are Nazis and human beings are the red garden. Human beings are the slaughterers in Rwanda and we're all human beings, and so to take on the sins of the world means to realize that all those things that characterize the human capacity to turn the earth into hell characterize you, and then in order to live properly, you have to live in a manner that addresses those elements of your nature.

Speaker 2:          44:02          And again, that's it. That's a terrible responsibility. Well, first of all, who wants to admit that? Second of all, who can stand looking at it and third, who's going to take on the burden of solving it? Well, it better be all of us or we're just going to keep doing it. So redemption, what? What does it mean? It means we're not in a state of grace. Why? We're self conscious. We're aware of the owner of the tragedy of our being. We're unwilling to take full responsibility for it or were ignorant about how to do that and that leaves us bereft. How do we solve that? Well, we can solve it with a estate, but the problem is the state is not reliable. It degenerated into tyranny. Then it transforms into chaos. Then it reconstitutes itself and does the same thing again. It's not a good answer. Is there another answer? Well, maybe. I believe that what is outlined in narrative form in the new testament is psychologically correct. I believe that the idea that endless micro death and renewal produces a state of proper ad outpatient to being and that the prerequisites for that that are laid out in the narrative structure that underlies the new testament are fundamentally correct.

Speaker 2:          45:45          So to be redeemed is to aim at the highest value, to sacrifice what's no longer useful and valid in yourself and to tell the truth and the consequence of that is existence in a deep state of meaning that justifies the tragedy of being and the possibility of transforming your own life in the most beneficial, positive direction while simultaneously doing that for the people around you. And that's redemption. Thank you very much.

Speaker 1:          46:20          Thank you.
