1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,540
I want to talk to you today about what I
think is a relatively new way of looking

2
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:10,880
at your experience,
but maybe even more broadly than that in

3
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:15,881
a new way of looking at reality itself.
You all come to university,

4
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:16,914
I suppose to make your conceptions of 
reality more sophisticated and you want 

5
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:24,654
to do that because you have to live in 
the world and the more sophisticated 

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:28,944
your conceptions,
the less likely you'll encounter tragic 

7
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:36,660
or harmful circumstances that you will 
be unable to deal with.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,653
It really matters if you know what 
you're thinking and you know how to 

9
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:42,084
think.

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,860
Over the last 20 years,
I would say there's been a revolution in

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,063
psychology and the revolution has 
involved a transformation in the way 

12
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:57,690
that we look at the world and that's 
what I want to talk to you about today.

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,030
I've entitled this talk reality and the 
sacred.

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,923
It's a strange title for a talk to 
modern people because we don't really 

15
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,244
understand what the sacred means unless 
we live within a worldview that says 

16
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:11,700
essentially,
I wouldn't say archaic,

17
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:15,330
but at least traditional for modern free
thinking.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,553
Fundamentally liberal people.
The idea of the sacred is anachronistic 

19
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,010
or if not anachronistic,
at least incomprehensible.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,713
So I want.
I want to start with a story from the 

21
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:26,334
Old Testament.
There's a scene in the old testament 

22
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,123
when the ancient Hebrews are moving the 
Ark of the covenant and the Ark of the 

23
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,694
covenant is a device that was 
manufactured in order to contain the 

24
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:37,944
word of God and there was a rule among 
the ancient Hebrews which was you were 

25
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,130
not to touch the Ark of the covenant no 
matter what,

26
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,563
and there's a story in the old testament
were the bearers of the Ark of the 

27
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:50,550
covenant.

28
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,383
They used to carry it,
the bearers of the Ark of the covenant 

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,283
trip,
and a man reaches out to steady it and 

30
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,370
when he touches it,
God strikes them dead and modern.

31
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:06,660
People look at a story like that and the
first thing they think is a that seems a

32
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,494
little bit harsh on the part of God,
given that the man was attempting to do 

33
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:11,724
something that he believed was good,
but what the story is designed to 

34
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:16,830
indicate,
in my opinion,

35
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:20,910
is that there are certain things that 
you touch at your peril,

36
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,570
regardless of your intentions and those 
things that you touch at your peril,

37
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,420
regardless of your intentions.
Most cultures regard as sacred,

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,800
as untouchable.
I want to make a case for you today that

39
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,693
those things exist and also why they 
exist and why it's necessary for you to 

40
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:42,540
know that they exist.
I would also say that if you're properly

41
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,374
educated in the university,
especially with regards to the 

42
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:49,200
humanities which are in some conceptual 
trouble at the moment,

43
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,543
what you are,
what essentially happens to you is that 

44
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,154
you're introduced in a relatively 
secular way to the concept of the 

45
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:56,460
sacred.

46
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,120
You're here in the university to learn 
about the eternal values of humankind,

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,153
and I think that people who tell you 
that those values do not exist or that 

48
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:11,110
they're endlessly debatable.
Do you an an unbelievable disservice?

49
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,950
Now I'm going to tell you first how you 
think about the world.

50
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,083
I think so.
This would be a Newtonian view of the 

51
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:19,924
world.
It's Newtonian and deterministic and 

52
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,983
it's a worldview that dominated 
psychology and economics and 

53
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:30,331
anthropology and political science.
You name it for probably 400 years,

54
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,630
but it's coming to a crashing halt in 
the last 50 years,

55
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,070
and the consequence of that consequences
of that have been manifested in a number

56
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:39,904
of domains.
The old world presuppositions or 

57
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:47,350
something like this.
The world is made out of objects.

58
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,230
When you look at the world,
you see the objects,

59
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,193
they are,
they are in front of you as a 

60
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:57,391
consequence of seeing the objects.
You think about what to do and after you

61
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:01,300
think about what to do in presence of 
the objects you act.

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,620
Now that seems self evident because when
you look at the world,

63
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,863
there are the objects are and it appears
to you that you see them and then you 

64
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:15,940
think about them and then you act,
but there's a real problem with that.

65
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,013
First problem is use half your brain to 
see literally human visual Cortex is 

66
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:27,904
very large part of your brain and the 
reason that the visual cortex is so 

67
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:35,791
large is that seeing is as far as we can
tell actually impossible now,

68
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:39,040
the fact that seeing perception is 
impossible,

69
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,063
it wasn't discovered by psychologists 
and it wasn't discovered by 

70
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:42,574
philosophers,
was discovered by people who are 

71
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:45,794
working,
who were working on artificial 

72
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:50,110
intelligence and trying to make 
artificially intelligent machines.

73
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,970
The presupposition of the people who 
were making intelligent machines was the

74
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:55,804
hardest part of interacting with the 
world is figuring out what to do once 

75
00:04:58,811 --> 00:04:59,644
you see the objects,
but it turned out that making machines 

76
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,884
that could see objects was impossible,
and the reason for that is that 

77
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:08,410
boundaries between objects are not 
obvious.

78
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,870
They're not obvious at all.
In fact,

79
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:14,560
it's very difficult to understand how it
is that we separate things up at all.

80
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,810
I'll let me give you an example.
So if you think about yourself,

81
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,720
when you look in the mirror,
you see yourself as an object.

82
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:24,040
You see your eyes,
you see your nose,

83
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,930
you see your face,
you see your body,

84
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,960
and that's pretty much what you see when
you look at other people,

85
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,780
but that isn't all there is to you.
In fact,

86
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,970
that's hardly any of what there is to 
you,

87
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,370
so you could say,
for example,

88
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,400
you exist at the level of the quantum 
particle.

89
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,533
You can't perceive that in fact,
people didn't know that until 75 years 

90
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:44,770
ago.
Above that level,

91
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:45,604
you exist at an atomic level and then a 
molecular level and then you exist at 

92
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,464
the level of complex organs and then the
interactions between those organs and 

93
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:54,634
then you and then your family and then 
the groups that your family belonged to 

94
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,943
and then the ecosystem that the groups 
of your are that that all your groups 

95
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:09,200
belong to and on and so on,
so on and so forth until what it is that

96
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,530
you are can expand to encompass 
virtually anything.

97
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,010
Now,
when you look at yourself,

98
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,903
you don't see that.
You see yourself at a certain level of 

99
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:20,180
resolution.
When you look at the world,

100
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,190
you see yourself at a certain level of 
resolution,

101
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,323
but all those other levels are equally 
real and equally relevant and Lee in 

102
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,454
fact have very little idea how it is 
that you're only able to see what you 

103
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:31,454
see.

104
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,540
Almost nothing has obvious boundaries 
and this has real world consequences.

105
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,063
It's not something that's merely 
abstract the technical term for this 

106
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:43,384
problem.
No problem of how to bind your 

107
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:45,334
perceptions to limit them is called the 
frame problem framing problem was 

108
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:53,470
discovered about 40 years ago and the 
philosopher Daniel Dennett called it the

109
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:57,520
most important philosophical discussion,
a discovery of the last 50 years.

110
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,010
The frame problem emerges to cause all 
sorts of trouble for people.

111
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,380
So for example,
when Henry Ford invented the automobile,

112
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,620
well at least invented the modern 
procedure of building the automobile.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,833
What Ford presumed was that he was 
building an efficient means of 

114
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:17,830
transporting people from one place to 
the other.

115
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,540
There were other unintended consequences
affords discovery.

116
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,153
So for example,
for it happened to be a great supporter 

117
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:27,944
of fascism and the reason that he was a 
supporter of fascism bit wasn't because 

118
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,144
he regarded the Fascia fascist political
structure as a logical extension of the 

119
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,840
efficient methods that he'd used to 
assemble vehicles.

120
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,820
So his motive production was instantly 
manifested in a political philosophy.

121
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,830
Furthermore,
now 2009,

122
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,620
100 years after the invention of the 
automobile,

123
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,693
we've discovered some other things that 
the car was other than a place to move 

124
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:58,310
people from point a to point b.
So for example,

125
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,690
it turns out that the automobile and the
internal combustion engine are among the

126
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,524
most effective technologies ever devised
to transform the nature of the 

127
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:09,530
atmosphere to heat up the world.
Not only that,

128
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,080
the car is completely transformed the 
nature of cities,

129
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,453
and these were all unintended 
consequences of the fact that the car 

130
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:18,440
was far more than what people thought it
was.

131
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,230
You can say that about any technological
structure.

132
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,260
No one knew what TV would do to the 
news.

133
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,094
For example,
no one knew what the Internet would do 

134
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,870
to the music industry.
Everything that you interact with is far

135
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,490
more complicated than you see.

136
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,210
Yeah.

137
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,650
The most ancient ideas we have about the
nature of reality make are predicated on

138
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:42,040
a certain presupposition,
and the presupposition is this.

139
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,710
There's two fundamental modes of being 
that characterize reality.

140
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,750
One is the absolute and absolute is the 
sum total of everything,

141
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,850
so if you think about things in their 
most possible form,

142
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,870
if you think of the things in their 
infinite number of potential variations,

143
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,390
you can think about that as one pool of 
reality.

144
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,163
It appears classically that people have 
regarded their encounters with the 

145
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,514
absolute,
which has all those multiple levels of 

146
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:11,244
being that are beyond your perceptual 
capacity as equivalent to an encounter 

147
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,174
with God.
Now you know that in the Islamic 

148
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,264
religion,
it's against the rules to make a graven 

149
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:21,420
image of any sort of Mohammed,
right?

150
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,250
The idea is that you're not supposed to 
make an image,

151
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,980
and among the ancient Hebrews the idea 
was very similar.

152
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,563
The Dow is say that you shouldn't 
confuse the moon with a finger pointing 

153
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:31,944
to the moon and what all that means is 
that the absolute is always something 

154
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,750
that transcends the finite frame that 
you place around your perceptions.

155
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,270
So as soon as you start talking about 
it,

156
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:45,510
representing it,
making statues of it or idolizing it,

157
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,344
you lose your connection with the 
absolute because you've turned it into 

158
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:50,520
something that's understandable and 
concrete.

159
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,900
Part of the wisdom traditions that the 
world still maintains.

160
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,573
Make the constant moral presupposition 
that you should always be aware of what 

161
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:04,494
it is that transcends both your 
understanding and your perceptions and 

162
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:09,540
you should keep firmly in mind that that
exists.

163
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,360
Now.
When people talk about God in the modern

164
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,194
world,
they tend to think about something 

165
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:14,664
that's more a.
That more has more of the 

166
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,094
characteristics of a being,
and I suppose that's where most of the 

167
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,210
debate about religious reality comes in.

168
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,493
But the idea that there's an absolute 
that's outside of your perceptual 

169
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:28,170
capacity seems to be to be merely a 
statement of fact.

170
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,800
Especially given what we know now about 
the nature of perception.

171
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,400
That the phenomena always transcends the
manner in which you frame it.

172
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,733
We've also come to understand that not 
only does reality have multiple levels 

173
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:43,680
of existence,
but in order to perceive it,

174
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,850
you have to stand inside multiple 
frames.

175
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,680
This is a picture of a French city.
It's a walled city.

176
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,503
Now the walls are there to keep the 
people in and the walls are there to 

177
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,334
keep what isn't in the walls out,
and so you can think about that as a 

178
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,233
protective structure.
Now I want to tell you how it is that 

179
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:10,920
you still inhabit a walled city and 
exactly what that means.

180
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,053
So for example,
you think about this room and I'm going 

181
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:16,854
to tell you how it is that this room 
allows you to see what it is that you 

182
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:20,904
see.

183
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,070
Now,
when you're interacting with a computer,

184
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,200
you actually don't interact with the 
computer.

185
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,690
You interact with the keyboard and the 
screen.

186
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,243
If the computer crashes,
then you interact with the computer and 

187
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:32,514
you find that as a general rule,
very annoying because you don't really 

188
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:38,880
understand the computer very well and 
you don't actually see how complex it is

189
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:42,450
until it stops working.
Most of the time when you're interacting

190
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,970
with the world,
you're doing things with the world.

191
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,380
You're interacting with it in a way that
produces some consequence that you want,

192
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,513
and that means in part that your 
perceptions are always framed by what 

193
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,094
you want and that's actually one of the 
reasons why the world isn't just made 

194
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,244
out of objects.
The world is made out of things you use 

195
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,453
and things that get in your way.
Now you're always applying a frame like 

196
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:05,254
that to the world in order to simplify 
it enough so that you can understand it 

197
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,343
and you're aided in this process by all 
sorts of processes you really don't 

198
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,150
notice because when you look at the 
world,

199
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:13,841
you think,
well,

200
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:14,674
there are the objects,
but there's a thousand things going on 

201
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:18,340
before you make that judgment.

202
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,290
So we'll look at this room.

203
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,520
When you walked in here,
the room tells you what to do.

204
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,850
The reason it tells you what to do is 
because all the seats are pointed in the

205
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:31,390
same direction.
They're all slanted in a particular way.

206
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,760
When you walk in here and there's other 
people sitting,

207
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,970
you can see all their faces point to the
front.

208
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,510
People's faces point towards what 
interests the room is set up to make you

209
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,344
face the front.
The theory behind the room is that the 

210
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:45,940
thing that's interesting in the room is 
happening at the front.

211
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,953
It's a theater.
What's happening at the front is a 

212
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:50,290
drama,
right?

213
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:54,370
Because theater is there to promote and 
and and undergird drama.

214
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,293
A lecture is a dramatic act.
The room tells you what to do so you 

215
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:01,210
don't have to think about what to do.
When you come into a room like this,

216
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,103
you can just do it because the room 
tells you what to do and then you can 

217
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:05,854
think.

218
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,850
You can sit in here in relative comfort 
and listen to this lecture.

219
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,760
Why can you sit in here in relative 
comfort?

220
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,613
Well,
the people around you have been 

221
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,320
relatively carefully selected,
right?

222
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,500
As a consequence of analysis of their 12
years in school.

223
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,513
The university has made a determination 
that they know how to sit down and 

224
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:26,604
listen,
that hypothetically they're intelligent 

225
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:29,544
enough to understand the lecture and 
that they're very unlikely to disrupt 

226
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:36,600
the proceedings with any unexpected 
outburst of emotion or motivation.

227
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,090
Now,
if anybody broke one of those rules,

228
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,013
you can be sure that your eyes would 
move very rapidly away from me and 

229
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,104
directly towards the person who was 
causing the trouble because that would 

230
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:46,920
take center stage.

231
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,403
Now,
this room is actually supported by a 

232
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:53,280
million invisible processes,
so for example,

233
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:54,114
while you're sitting in here,
you don't have to worry about whether 

234
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:55,824
it's raining because there's a roof and 
you don't have to worry about whether 

235
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,050
the roof is going to fall in because you
make the presumption that the people who

236
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:01,884
built the roof are competent and the 
electricity works because the 

237
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:07,560
electricity is the utility is run by 
people who were competent,

238
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:10,710
so it's almost always on buildings 
hardly ever burned down.

239
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,693
The electricity hardly ever fluctuates.
There's thousands of people out there 

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,320
working as hard as they can diligently 
to make this environment constant enough

241
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,273
so that you can ignore all the thousands
of things that you're ignoring so that 

242
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,064
you can concentrate well enough to 
attend to the few things that you are 

243
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:29,790
attending to while you're in this room.
You're in a walled city.

244
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,253
There's multiple walls,
and those walls protect you from what's 

245
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:38,931
outside the walls.
You can think about it this way.

246
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,943
This is a taoist image of reality.
Now people think about this as a 

247
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:48,190
metaphysical symbol,

248
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,990
but it's not a metaphysical.
It's an unbelievably practical symbol.

249
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,663
The Dallas believe that the world,
the reality is made up essentially of 

250
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,274
chaos and order.
Chaos is all those things you don't 

251
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:05,054
understand,
so I would say that chaos is all those 

252
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:09,890
things that exist outside of your 
perceptual preconditions.

253
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,193
Order is all the things you do 
understand and all the places you go 

254
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,530
where the things that you do produce,
the results that you intend,

255
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,550
and the Dallas would say,
everywhere you go,

256
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:23,384
it's like that.
Everywhere you go has things that you 

257
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,084
understand that or orderly and has 
things that you don't understand that 

258
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:29,504
are chaotic and the chaotic things 
attract your attention because you 

259
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:36,911
already understand the orderly things.
If something unexpected happened to your

260
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:38,710
nervous system,
automatically reacts to it,

261
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,720
orients you towards it,
and sometimes that can be catastrophic.

262
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,800
So this is an experience that some of 
you will have in the next four years.

263
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,993
Undoubtedly there's a number of you that
want to go to medical school or to 

264
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:52,880
graduate school or to law school or 
business school,

265
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,433
and a certain percentage of you will 
take the admission tests that will 

266
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:57,674
determine whether or not you're able to 
take that path and a certain percentage 

267
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:01,844
of you will score below the 50th 
percentile on those tests and that will 

268
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:07,880
make and you will not be going to those 
institutions.

269
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,520
And when that happens,
first of all,

270
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,880
you'll shake and tremble when you open 
the envelope to find out your results.

271
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,983
And second,
if you haven't achieved the score that 

272
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:17,660
you expected,
that you will achieve,

273
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,060
that you achieve,
your world will fall apart.

274
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,913
And what that'll mean is that you 
descend from the domain of order into 

275
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:27,350
the domain of chaos,
and that happens to people all the time.

276
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,040
It happens to people when they develop 
an illness that's serious,

277
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,550
that they can't control because then 
their body stops becoming something they

278
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:37,940
can predict and starts to become 
something that they can't predict.

279
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,103
It happens to people when they're in an 
intimate relationship and there'll be 

280
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:42,314
trained,
they assumed fidelity and the person 

281
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:47,600
tells them that they've had an affair.
That's chaos.

282
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,000
That means you didn't know who that 
person was.

283
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,810
The future you imagine no longer exists.
Your perceptions of people are erroneous

284
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:58,310
at some level of analysis that you don't
understand.

285
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,533
It's conceivable that you're naive 
beyond belief and that everything you 

286
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:05,420
believed about yourself and other people
up to that point is false,

287
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,080
and when the revelation occurs that 
knocks out one of the walls that support

288
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:12,920
to you and you descend accidentally into
chaos.

289
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,860
You'll regard that as one of the worst 
experiences of your life.

290
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,940
When that happens to you,
your brain knows exactly what to do.

291
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,163
It stops thinking about the future.
It stops saving up resources for their 

292
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:24,784
future.
It puts you in emergency preparation 

293
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:30,470
mode so you're ready to do anything at 
the drop of a hat because you don't know

294
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:33,440
what to do,
so your body prepares to do everything.

295
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,543
It shifts your cortisol levels up.
It activates your left and right a 

296
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,820
quarter sees your limbic system and your
motivational systems are disinhibited,

297
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,270
turned on and you sweat and you can't 
sleep because the orderly structure that

298
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:50,514
you thought you inhabited that provided 
you with security and direction has now 

299
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,444
disappeared from the Dallas,
believed that the world is always an 

300
00:17:57,721 --> 00:18:01,560
interplay between chaos and order and 
that if you live your life properly,

301
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,580
you stand with one foot in order and one
foot in chaos.

302
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,133
Because if you're only an order,
nothing that's interesting ever happens 

303
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,374
to you.
Nothing is anything but a repeat of all 

304
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,733
of all the things that you already know.
That's the state that fascists desire 

305
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,143
because fascist desire things to be 
exactly the way they are forever and if 

306
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:24,060
you're in a that's only characterized by
chaos.

307
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,073
You're at sea or overwhelmed or things 
have fallen apart for you and there's 

308
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,000
too much of everything for you to deal 
with.

309
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,340
Now,
the Dallas being very wise,

310
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:34,830
people know other things as well and 
they know,

311
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:36,780
for example,
the chaos can turn into order.

312
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,350
That's why there's a white.in
the middle of the Black Paisley and they

313
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:44,670
know that order can turn into chaos,
which is why there's a black.in

314
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:49,671
the middle of the White Paisley and the 
Dallas believed that a meaningful life,

315
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,233
the optimally meaningful life is to be 
found on the border between chaos and 

316
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:57,150
order,
and I would say that your nervous system

317
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,984
tells you exactly when you are there and
it's a kind of place and you can tell 

318
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:05,310
when you're there because you're secure 
enough to be confident but not so secure

319
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,420
that you're bored and you're interested 
enough to be awake but not so interested

320
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:12,420
that you're terrified.
And when you're in a state like that,

321
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:14,400
when you find things interesting and 
meaningful,

322
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,383
time slips by you and you're no longer.
Self conscious is a medieval Christian 

323
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:23,990
representation of the nature of reality.
On the outside.

324
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:28,160
You have the Virgin Mary inside the 
Virgin Mary.

325
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:28,994
You have God the father and God.
The father was supporting a crucifix 

326
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:36,920
with an individual on an individual,
and Christian thinking is Christ.

327
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,430
What does this image mean?
The walled city divides order from chaos

328
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,513
or order from nature.
We think about nature as the thing 

329
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:55,580
that's outside of what we understand.
That's mother nature.

330
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,160
Mother Nature gives birth to all things.

331
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,070
That's the idea that's expressed in this
image.

332
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,040
So the Virgin Mary is standing for 
Mother Nature.

333
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,920
Out of Mother Nature arises order and 
tradition.

334
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,410
How it's true for primates like 
chimpanzees,

335
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:11,244
as much as it's true for us,
any social animals that are grouped 

336
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:17,550
together have to form an orderly 
structure that they can inhabit together

337
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,473
that defines their boundaries and their 
goals because otherwise they fight each 

338
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:24,690
other to the death.
So in the state of untrammeled nature,

339
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,643
as Hobbes pointed out,
it's every man for himself and without 

340
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,633
the order that tradition brains,
there is nothing but chaos and chaos is 

341
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,670
murderous and unproductive.
When there's a problem with order.

342
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,450
If you look at the history of the 20th 
century,

343
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,903
it's a tossup whether mother nature has 
been harder on us or whether our 

344
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,040
governmental traditions been harder on 
us.

345
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,983
You know,
of course that the dictatorship of 

346
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:53,104
Hitler killed 6 million Jews,
120 million people in the Second World 

347
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,780
War.
The you may not know that the stalinists

348
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:02,614
dictatorships in the Soviet Union killed
an estimated 60 million people in 

349
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:06,844
internal repression,
not counting those people who died in 

350
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:09,244
the second world war and the internal 
repression that characterized Mao's 

351
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,310
communist China killed 100 million 
people.

352
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,313
And so the problem with tradition is 
that sometimes it's a wise king and 

353
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:23,080
sometimes it's a king that eats its own 
sons,

354
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,393
which means that although we need 
tradition to guide us and to structure 

355
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,480
even the manner in which we perceive the
world,

356
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,340
our traditions can become archaic and 
outdated and cruel and inhuman,

357
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,100
and as a consequence they can pose a 
threat to us.

358
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:36,934
Then chaos itself.
Nature or chaos is exactly the same 

359
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,343
dichotomous structure.
The figure on the left is a medusa or a 

360
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:51,714
Gorgon.
If you look at them and do so as you 

361
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:56,990
probably already know,
you turned to stone.

362
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,153
The reason you turned to stone is 
because when you look upon nature or 

363
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:02,874
chaos without your normal veils,
it paralyzes you physiologically just 

364
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:09,534
like a prey animal,
like a rabbit is terrified if it sees a 

365
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:16,050
wolf for millions of years,
human beings were prey animals.

366
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,830
We were probably prey animals for large 
reptiles,

367
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,810
which accounts,
for example,

368
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:25,290
for the reason that it appears that 
primates like us are naturally afraid of

369
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,550
predatory reptiles.

370
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,233
If you're in the presence of something 
that violates your assumptions of 

371
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,584
safety,
you'll freeze it freeze so that the 

372
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:39,500
thing that might eat you can't see you,
and that's what turns you to stone.

373
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,413
That's nature and it's terrible aspect 
and the terrible aspect of nature can 

374
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:45,614
freeze everyone and you can be sure and 
we'll be seldom taught that you will 

375
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,290
encounter that at some point in your 
life.

376
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,640
The primary Buddhist dictum is that life
is suffering and what does that mean?

377
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,293
It means that because you're finite and 
you're surrounded by something that's 

378
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:07,334
absolute in a sense,
you're in a battle that you can never 

379
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:14,300
win because there's always more of what 
it is that you're trying to contend with

380
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,720
than there is with you and worse than 
that,

381
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,853
and it's for this reason,
the tyrannies can't last is that the 

382
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:24,290
thing that you're contending with isn't 
even static.

383
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,240
It keeps changing so that what worked 
for you yesterday won't necessarily work

384
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,074
for you tomorrow.
This is an l chemical version of the 

385
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:36,754
Taoist Yin and Yang symbol and basically
it says something that's more 

386
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:39,904
sophisticated and complex.
It says that the world is made up of 

387
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:43,594
chaos and order.
Things that you can predict and 

388
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:48,410
understand and things that you can't 
predict and can't understand,

389
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,500
and inside the order there's some chaos,
and inside that chaos there's some order

390
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:53,334
and that order.
There's some chaos and so on and so 

391
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:58,190
forth,
and equally the case for order.

392
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,780
You have mother nature,
representation of chaos,

393
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,540
sometimes positive,
sometimes negative.

394
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,733
You have a representation of the great 
father that's security and tyranny to 

395
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:15,960
things you'll always have to contend 
with.

396
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,420
And finally,
in this representation,

397
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:21,150
you have a representation of the 
individual,

398
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,680
at least a Christian representation of 
the individual,

399
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:26,160
and that's Christ,
and it's a terrifying representation.

400
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,623
It's a remarkable representation because
it's not a representation of 

401
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,110
transcendence,
it's a representation of suffering,

402
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:39,030
and it's a funny kind of representation 
of suffering because the manner in which

403
00:24:39,031 --> 00:24:42,270
the story unfolds is this,
Christ,

404
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,343
as the archetipal individual,
the model for individuals from a 

405
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,063
psychological or mythological 
perspective knows that he's limited and 

406
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:54,590
knows that he's due to both suffering 
and death in the garden of gifts.

407
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,370
Seventy the night before his 
crucifixion,

408
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,160
he has an argument with God,
and the argument basically is a,

409
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,750
do I actually have to do this?
And the answer is twofold.

410
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,271
Well,
no,

411
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:05,400
actually you don't have to accept your 
suffering,

412
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:06,983
but

413
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,350
you don't have to voluntarily accept 
your suffering,

414
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:13,960
but there are consequences if you don't.
Now,

415
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:17,410
the Christian story is predicated on the
idea that if you voluntarily accept your

416
00:25:17,411 --> 00:25:19,630
suffering,
you can cymbalta obviously transcended.

417
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,483
So remarkable philosophy.
And it's also something that we have 

418
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:28,510
very good support for from a 
psychological perspective.

419
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,763
So for example,
if I'm treating someone who has an 

420
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:32,704
anxiety disorder or panic disorder who 
can go out of their house without their 

421
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:36,094
heart rate elevating and without 
collapsing into a panic stricken heap 

422
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,400
without visiting the emergency ward,
every time their heart rate accelerates,

423
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:44,650
every time they're in the subway,
every time they're in a mall,

424
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,130
so they're so terrified of existence,
they can't even get out of their house.

425
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,820
The Way you cure that person is by 
getting them to voluntarily approach the

426
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:55,150
things that they're afraid of.
And it turns out that physiologically,

427
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,450
if I force you to accept a certain kind 
of challenge,

428
00:25:58,451 --> 00:25:59,284
your body will go into emergency 
preparation mode and you'll become 

429
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:04,900
stressed and that stress will cause you 
physiological damage,

430
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,390
including brain damage.
If it's sustained for long enough.

431
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,140
But if I present you with the same 
challenge and you accepted voluntarily,

432
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,033
your brain doesn't produce stress 
hormones and completely different 

433
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:14,464
physiological systems kick in.
And what that means is that people have 

434
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:19,330
evolved to modes for dealing with the 
unknown.

435
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,450
One is voluntary approach and the other 
is panic stricken paralysis and flight.

436
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:30,243
In this representation,
you can see that there are crowds of 

437
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:33,874
people standing in the wings of the Open
Statue Looking at the crucified 

438
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,600
individual.
It's a very strange thing,

439
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:41,920
but you know,
you still see this,

440
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:45,180
you still see people doing things like 
this that they don't notice.

441
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,910
I went to a museum in New York and there
were a very large number of paintings.

442
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:51,744
They're from the late renaissance and 
they were all religiously themed like 

443
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:55,890
medieval paintings,
except they,

444
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,053
um,
they featured recognizable individuals 

445
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:03,810
and people had come from all over the 
world to look at those paintings.

446
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:05,820
They were extremely valuable paintings,
you know,

447
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,460
they were painted by Michelangelo or 
Leonardo Da Vinci.

448
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,294
And um,
each of them was probably valued for 

449
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:12,780
reasons that are very difficult to 
understand,

450
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,990
something approximating hundreds of 
millions of dollars.

451
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,783
The late renaissance was the first time 
in human history where human beings 

452
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:24,780
dared to presume that sacred images 
could be given an individual human face.

453
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,823
And that idea was actually what launched
the enlightenment and launched the 

454
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:32,310
development of modern culture.
The late renaissance thinkers.

455
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:33,144
The artists in particular were the first
people to posit that there was some 

456
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:40,281
direct relationship between these sacred
images and actual people and people come

457
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:41,214
from all over the world to look at these
paintings even though they don't 

458
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:43,914
understand what they mean.
I want to show you some images that 

459
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:48,354
describe how the idea of the suffering 
individual developed and what that 

460
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:54,474
means.
The first thing I want to show you is 

461
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:58,200
this picture of St George and the 
Dragon.

462
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:04,190
Now you know the main street that runs 
through the university is named after St

463
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,333
George,
right?

464
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,720
This is a very old image.
I'm the oldest story we know,

465
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,080
which is a Mesopotamian creation.
Myth features a,

466
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,023
a God who confronts a reptilian monster 
and makes the world as a consequence of 

467
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:21,564
the conflict.

468
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,770
He faces her.
She's terrifying.

469
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,623
He cuts her up into pieces and one of 
the pieces that makes the world now the 

470
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:29,640
Mesopotamians 5,000
years ago,

471
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,630
we're trying to figure out what the 
nature of individuality was and what the

472
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:34,464
nature of consciousness was and their 
presupposition which was dramatized 

473
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,530
because these people told stories.
They didn't think the way we think,

474
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:43,440
and in,
in an explicit philosophical,

475
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,660
logical meet,
uh,

476
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,903
with philosophical processes,
they thought in stories which is a 

477
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,394
natural way for people to think.
They came to the conclusion that the 

478
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:58,260
object of their ultimate worship was the
God who confronted the dragon of chaos,

479
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,153
cut it into pieces and made the world.
And that idea has echo down through the 

480
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:04,434
ages.
It's an idea that human beings have 

481
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:07,320
never lost.
Now this idea is very interesting,

482
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:08,154
so you see the castle in the background 
and we already know what the castle 

483
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:10,920
stands for.

484
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,753
The castle stands for order and it's a 
multi walled castle because everyone's 

485
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:19,050
protected by multiple walls,
but those walls are constantly breached.

486
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,340
Now,
young people,

487
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,174
especially modern young people,
are often very cynical about the 

488
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:24,174
traditions that they inhabit.
They're cynical about them because they 

489
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:27,174
see the fact that the world is 
theoretically devolving into some kind 

490
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:30,294
of environmental catastrophe and they're
cynical because they're still worn 

491
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,670
because there's still hunger there,
cynical because often the people who are

492
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:38,490
teaching them the traditions don't seem 
to believe in them themselves.

493
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,533
And it's very easy for young people to 
look at the traditions that were and to 

494
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:47,110
notice the brakes with the truth of the 
matter is,

495
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:47,944
is that throughout human history,
tradition has always been an acronystic 

496
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:51,184
and out of date,
and what you see in images of St George 

497
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:55,810
and the Dragon is the dragon's always 
breached the walls,

498
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,350
which means that tradition is always 
under attack from chaos.

499
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,123
Well,
of course it is because the future is 

500
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:02,924
different than the past,
but that doesn't mean that the past 

501
00:30:04,911 --> 00:30:05,744
should be abandoned because if you 
abandoned the past and you knocked on 

502
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:08,944
all your walls,
you fall into a pit of chaos and that 

503
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:13,970
classically speaking,
is indistinguishably.

504
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,073
Indistinguishable from hell.
And I can tell you that if you spend 

505
00:30:17,841 --> 00:30:18,674
long enough in that state,
you'll become bitter and cruel because 

506
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:24,140
that's what happens to people who suffer
endlessly.

507
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,590
St George is a different kind of 
individual.

508
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:30,920
When the walls come crumbling down,
as they always do,

509
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,500
he decides to go out and to confront the
dragons.

510
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,720
Now,
dragons are very strange creatures,

511
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:37,580
as you may have already noted.
First of all,

512
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:40,220
they don't exist.
Second of all,

513
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:42,860
they have very weird propensities,
so for example,

514
00:30:42,861 --> 00:30:46,880
they hoard gold and they tend to trap 
virgins in their layer,

515
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,360
which you will also admit is very 
strange behavior for a reptile.

516
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,410
Now,
the idea behind this is that it's very,

517
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:56,840
very complicated idea and it's all 
presented pictorially.

518
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,960
The idea is that the thing that lurks 
underneath,

519
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:02,540
if you look to the right of the picture,
you can see that there's a cave.

520
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,433
The cave goes way down into the ground 
and way down into the ground is the 

521
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,540
terrifying place that's underneath 
everything.

522
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,553
The dragon crawls out from time to time 
to threaten the structure of everything 

523
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,034
that's known.
St George comes out to confront the 

524
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:17,300
dragon,
voluntarily overcomes it,

525
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,230
and in this image

526
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,480
rescues the virgin that the dragon has 
been guardian.

527
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,503
It's a very complicated story.
It means that the things that terrify 

528
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:31,094
you contain things of value.
That's also what the image of the goal 

529
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:37,190
that the dragon horns represent.
It means something else as well.

530
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:43,030
It means that the individual man who's 
likely to go out and confront chaos when

531
00:31:44,211 --> 00:31:47,270
tradition is crumbling,
is more likely to find a mate.

532
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,470
This is Jonah.

533
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,050
Joe and I had a very weird experience.
He was swallowed by a whale.

534
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,720
That's a very strange whale as you,
as you might well note.

535
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,613
It's a medieval whale,
and of course medieval people didn't 

536
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,360
really know what whales were and so they
were guessing what a way it was.

537
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:14,050
And so a whale for a mid evil person 
would have been a big fish,

538
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,283
would have been a squid.
That would have been some monstrous 

539
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:19,390
thing like a shark that lurks in the 
deep because they didn't have.

540
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,493
They weren't able to Segue,
segregate all those things out 

541
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:22,624
biologically.
Their,

542
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,480
their powers of collective observation 
weren't that good.

543
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,350
So the way off of them was what lurks 
underneath in the darkness,

544
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:31,950
right?
And the idea with Jonah was that now and

545
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:35,110
then what lurks underneath in the 
darkest rises up to swallow you,

546
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,140
but if your attitude is proper,
then you can come back out.

547
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:41,600
The other side changed.
Now that's a story of redemption.

548
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:42,620
So for example,

549
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,963
imagine that you are a,
we're in a bad relationship and maybe 

550
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:50,744
you weren't that happy about it,
but you know it was better than no 

551
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:52,994
relationship at all and then the person 
that you are in a relationship betrayed 

552
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,983
you and maybe they did that because you 
actually weren't that happy with the 

553
00:32:58,791 --> 00:32:59,624
relationship anyways.
Maybe they did that because you're a 

554
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:01,904
little bit naive or maybe they did that 
because you were a little bit too easy 

555
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,950
to get along with and as a consequent,
a little bit on the boring side.

556
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:08,863
And so when they first leave you,
it's a catastrophe because your world 

557
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:13,190
falls apart.
But when your world falls apart,

558
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:17,270
you're somewhere new as possible to 
learn something new in that place.

559
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,470
So you might learn,
for example,

560
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:19,304
that you should be a little sharper the 
next time that you go out with someone 

561
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,303
or you should be a little bit more 
careful about picking up on clues that 

562
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:26,024
your partner's board with you or that 
maybe you should stop associating with 

563
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:29,924
lying psychopaths and your life would be
a lot more positive and stop thinking 

564
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:38,990
that you have the capacity to redeem 
somebody that is not after redemption in

565
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:41,990
the least,
and what that means now and then is that

566
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:42,824
when you fall into the belly of a whale 
and you're swallowed up by something 

567
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:46,724
that lurks underneath that you can come 
out the other side transformed and 

568
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:52,460
that's actually how people learn.

569
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:53,983
Every time you learn something,
you learn because something you did 

570
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:57,524
didn't work,
and that exposes you to the part of the 

571
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:02,390
world that you don't understand.
Every time you're exposed to part of the

572
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:03,224
world that you don't understand,
you have the possibility of rebuilding 

573
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:08,750
the structures that you use to interpret
the world.

574
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,303
That's often why it's more important to 
notice that you're wrong than it is to 

575
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:13,664
prove that you're right.
One of the things that you're supposed 

576
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:16,064
to learn in university is precisely that
it might be useful to listen to people 

577
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:23,120
that annoy you on the off chance that 
they know something,

578
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:26,780
that if they tell you you can use 
instead of dying.

579
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,983
Talking to people who agree with what 
you say is like walking around in a 

580
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:33,734
desert.
You already know everything that they 

581
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:36,524
say.
The reason you're associating with them 

582
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:41,120
in that situation is so that they never 
say anything that challenges you because

583
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:41,954
you're afraid that if you go outside of 
what you understand that you won't be 

584
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:48,140
able to tolerate the chaos,
but it isn't the case.

585
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,213
People have an unbelievable capacity to 
face and overcome things they don't 

586
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:52,904
understand and not only that,
that's essentially what gives life its 

587
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:56,684
meaning.
The Buddhists say life is suffering and 

588
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:00,110
you think,
well,

589
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,360
if that's the case,
why bother with it?

590
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,853
And people do ask that question and they
ask it in ways that result in their own 

591
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:09,860
destruction and worse in the destruction
of others.

592
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,430
So for example,
people who become particularly cruel,

593
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:14,443
particularly in a genocidal manner,
are more than willing to dispense with 

594
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:18,344
as many human beings as they can 
possibly train their sights on because 

595
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:21,734
they're so disgusted by the nature of 
human limitation that they'd rather 

596
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,383
eradicated and lots of people become 
suicidal because they can't bear the 

597
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:34,091
conditions of their own existence and 
suffering is real and it's inescapable.

598
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,720
So the question is what you do about it.
You notice in your own life,

599
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,090
and you can do this by watching your own
life.

600
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,580
I often ask my clients to do this.
Say,

601
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:45,414
look,
watch your life for a week and pretend 

602
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:51,900
you don't know who you are because you 
don't know who you are at all,

603
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:53,963
what you understand most about yourself 
or the arbitrary presuppositions that 

604
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:57,834
you use to him yourself and and you act 
as if those presuppositions are true so 

605
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:07,371
that the revelation of the full nature 
of your character won't terrify you.

606
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,520
People hide in their own boxes and it's 
not surprising,

607
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,510
but it's not a good idea because life is
too hard to hide in a box.

608
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,550
You can't manage it.
If you do that,

609
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,270
if you watch yourself for a week,
you'll see certain things.

610
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:24,120
You'll see some of the time that you're 
resentful and annoyed,

611
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,223
and those are times when you're either 
taking advantage of yourself or you're 

612
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,020
thinking improperly.

613
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,453
Some of the time you'll be bored,
in which case you're either 

614
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:32,454
undisciplined or you're probably 
pursuing something you don't want to 

615
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:35,604
pursue,
and some of the time you'll actually be 

616
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:41,100
engaged in life and the Times that 
you're engaged in life,

617
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:43,950
you will notice that your there,
right?

618
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,060
The distinction between subject and 
object disappears when you're engaged in

619
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:52,920
something that you find meaningful.
The purpose of life as far as I can tell

620
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:56,040
from studying mythology and from 
studying psychology for decades,

621
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,353
is to find a mode of being that so 
meaningful that the fact that life is 

622
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:00,594
suffering is no longer relevant or maybe
that it's even acceptable and I would 

623
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:06,720
say as well that people know when 
they're doing that.

624
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,690
You know when you're doing that in part 
because you're no longer resentful,

625
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,441
you say,
Geez,

626
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:12,170
I could do this forever.
Right?

627
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,540
There's a timelessness,
timelessness that's associated with that

628
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,374
state of being from a mythological 
perspective that's equivalent to brief 

629
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,780
habitation of the Kingdom of God.

630
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,243
That's the place where you are that's so
meaningful that it enables you to bear 

631
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,130
the harsh conditions of life without 
becoming resentful,

632
00:37:29,131 --> 00:37:30,300
bitter,
or cruel,

633
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,620
and there's nothing that you can pursue 
in your life that will be half as useful

634
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:35,454
as that.
Your nervous system being an evolved 

635
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:39,654
structure is evolved for a universe that
is composed of the interaction between 

636
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:46,110
chaos and order.
Those are the most fundamental constants

637
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:46,944
that we know.
They transcend the mirror perception of 

638
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:52,410
objects.
Everywhere you go is chaos and order.

639
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,353
Traditional Chinese doctors go into 
people's houses to diagnose why it is 

640
00:37:57,811 --> 00:37:58,644
that someone in that house is suffering 
and they walk in and they think he was 

641
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:02,574
too much order.
Here,

642
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,163
I've been in houses like that.
That's a house where all the furniture 

643
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:07,994
is covered with plastic.
That's a house where if you put a glass 

644
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:13,650
on a wooden table,
the mistress of the house runs over with

645
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:16,170
the coaster,
slips it under immediately and gives you

646
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,004
a dirty look.
That's a place where the children never 

647
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:19,914
play in the living room.
That's a place where the lines in the 

648
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:27,810
carpet or vacuumed so precisely that 
they're actually parallel.

649
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,393
That's a place where there's so much 
order that no one can survive because 

650
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:32,844
the person who runs the house is a 
tyrant and then anyone who's in that 

651
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:36,130
house is sick

652
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,963
because they're suffering from an excess
of order and then you can walk into a 

653
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:40,594
house that's completely different and 
you can even see this in your own room 

654
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:45,880
if you want.
Everything's in complete disarray.

655
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,073
You can't even look at that place.
You're sick the moment you cross the 

656
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:50,734
threshold because everywhere you look,
there's parts of untransformed chaos 

657
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:00,190
yelling to you.
Do something about this loser.

658
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,563
If you walk into your study and you have
a stack of papers in the midst of which 

659
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:15,350
is buried your homework,
you'll notice that you have a very tough

660
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:20,330
time looking at that stack of papers and
the reason for that is that the stack of

661
00:39:20,331 --> 00:39:21,164
papers that you were ignoring that's 
aging and causing you more trouble with 

662
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:25,574
each passing day is a portal into order 
through which chaos is flowing and if 

663
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:30,974
you ignore that long enough,
the chaos will flow through that portal 

664
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:39,080
and take over your room and then take 
over your life and you might think,

665
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,943
well,
that's a very strange way of looking at 

666
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:46,080
things and I suppose it is,
but just as an experiment to see whether

667
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:46,914
or not this is true.
Try Not paying your taxes for 10 years 

668
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:50,720
and see what happens.

669
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,740
This is an old representation right 
atlas with the world.

670
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,933
Well,
it's a representation that says that 

671
00:40:00,051 --> 00:40:02,090
that's the proper way to live,
right?

672
00:40:02,091 --> 00:40:02,924
That the way that you live properly so 
that you can withstand the nature of 

673
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:10,250
your own being is to pick up a load 
that's heavy enough so that if you carry

674
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:12,170
it,
you have some self respect.

675
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,973
That's a very weird idea because it's 
frequently the case that people do 

676
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:18,620
everything they can to lighten their 
load,

677
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,783
but the problem with carrying a light 
load is that then you have nothing 

678
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:25,760
that's useful to do and if you have 
nothing useful to do all you have around

679
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:27,800
you,
unless you're extremely fortunate.

680
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:28,634
If not,
we'll only be the case for very short 

681
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:30,434
periods of time is meaningless.
Suffering and there's nothing worse for 

682
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:37,840
your sold and meaningless suffering.
If you look around,

683
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:38,674
you see the people that you respect and 
and I don't mean that you think about 

684
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:44,470
respecting.
I mean the ones that you're got,

685
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,313
your whole being,
your embodied being tells you to 

686
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:47,554
respect.
You'll see that it's always people who 

687
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:50,770
picked up something heavy and her 
caring.

688
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:53,620
It's successful.
You think now that's what it means to be

689
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:56,770
a human being,
and when you see that you can think,

690
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:57,604
well,
perhaps life is worthwhile despite the 

691
00:40:59,171 --> 00:41:01,720
fact that the essential nature of 
reality is suffering.

692
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,263
There's an old Jewish idea and the idea 
is that man and God are in a sense 

693
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:13,390
twins.
It's a very strange idea,

694
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:15,460
but it seems to hinge on something like 
this,

695
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,120
the classic attributes of God.
These are the attributes of the absolute

696
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,150
omniscience,
omnipotence and omnipresence.

697
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,480
Do anything be anything kind of 
translate the other one momentarily.

698
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:37,470
There's a question goes along with that.
What is it being that's characterized by

699
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,500
the absolute attributes of God lack

700
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,273
and the answer that is limitation and 
that's an unbelievably interesting idea 

701
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,283
and the reason it's so interesting is 
because one of the things that modern 

702
00:41:49,831 --> 00:41:50,664
psychology is increasingly telling us is
that without the limitation that a 

703
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:54,894
creature like us with the structure of 
our consciousness brings to bear on the 

704
00:41:58,381 --> 00:41:59,880
world.
There's no reality.

705
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,713
The reality is is an emergent 
consequence of the interaction between 

706
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:08,610
something that's painfully limited like 
the US and whatever the absolute is,

707
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,040
which is something that is completely 
without borders,

708
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,030
and what that implies in a sense is that
without limitation,

709
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:19,860
there's no being with limitation.
There's suffering without suffering.

710
00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:22,560
Then there's no Ba,
well you might think,

711
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:25,710
well perhaps there should be no beating 
and lots of people act their whole lives

712
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:26,544
in order to see if they can make that a 
possibility and that's really a luxury 

713
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:29,754
we don't have anymore,
but the alternative is to presume that 

714
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,353
being is worth the suffering and to find
a mode of being that allows you to make 

715
00:42:37,351 --> 00:42:38,184
that claim.

716
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,053
In reality,
I would say in a sense that's your 

717
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:41,574
existential destiny and if you're here 
at university rather than a trade 

718
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:45,834
school,
your job is to figure out how to be a 

719
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:52,881
human being and that's a much more 
important job than any specific time.

720
00:42:54,211 --> 00:42:56,970
Limited concrete permit,
pragmatic plan,

721
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,820
you have an unlimited possibility for 
good.

722
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,773
Really,
individuals are way more powerful than 

723
00:43:02,941 --> 00:43:04,860
they think.
They're more powerful for evil,

724
00:43:04,861 --> 00:43:05,694
but they're also more powerful for good.
These archaic stories that I've been 

725
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:12,090
telling you about,
they have something to say to you.

726
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,223
They say life is uncertain.
You'll never know enough and normally 

727
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,620
that you never can do enough,
and not only that,

728
00:43:19,621 --> 00:43:23,490
everything that you stand on is shaky 
and then they say,

729
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:26,400
but you still have to stand on it and 
while you're standing on it,

730
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,050
you have to improve it

731
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,410
and that's how life goes on and that's 
how you live your life and if you forget

732
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:34,244
those things or if you undermine them,
you're in the same situation that the 

733
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:38,714
unfortunate man was that I told you 
about in the Old Testament who reached 

734
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:45,110
out to touch something he should've left
alone.

735
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,023
To the degree that you're human,
you have to abide by a certain set of 

736
00:43:51,741 --> 00:43:52,574
truths.
The truths that I told you about today 

737
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,030
are as far as I can tell,
something that's close to a minimal set.

738
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,150
There's chaos.
There's order.

739
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,493
You're stuck with both of them and they 
both have a cost and they both have 

740
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:10,370
advantages and your job is to figure out
how to serve as the appropriate mediator

741
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:11,204
between the two.
And you can tell when you're doing that 

742
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:14,294
because when you're doing that,
the dismal circumstances of your life 

743
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,580
manifest them selves to you as eminently
acceptable,

744
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,073
and it's in that situation that you know
that you've placed yourself in a 

745
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:28,604
position in nature where everything is 
in harmony and that's the place to aim 

746
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:34,680
for.
Nice talking to you.

747
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,473
The first thing I would say is that if 
you're dealing with someone who's 

748
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,873
depressed and they're really depressed,
you should try giving them 

749
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:54,710
antidepressants because if they die,
you can't help them.

750
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,590
Okay?
So if you're suffering,

751
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:03,220
you are obligated in a sense to hold 
onto whatever roped someone throws you.

752
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,530
And one of the things I do with my 
clients all the time,

753
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,390
especially if they're really in trouble,
is to tell them,

754
00:45:08,391 --> 00:45:09,224
look,
I don't know exactly what's going to 

755
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:11,180
happen.
Help you,

756
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,930
but don't arbitrarily throw out any 
possibilities because you might not have

757
00:45:14,931 --> 00:45:17,990
that luxury.
Antidepressants help a lot of people and

758
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:20,060
there are technical reasons why that's 
the case.

759
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,253
So that's a simple answer.
It's not relevant to what I already 

760
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:28,640
described except that if you're offered 
a gift by your society and it works,

761
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,503
try it.
I don't care what your presuppositions 

762
00:45:31,251 --> 00:45:34,190
are.
Apart from that,

763
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,093
lots of lots of time,
lots of the time you see people who are 

764
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,110
suffering with depression,
for example.

765
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:45,330
There's a multitude of reasons,
but I'll take one common reason.

766
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,543
Um,
you could think about it as associated 

767
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:48,834
with the story of Peter Pan.
Peter Pan is someone who won't grow up 

768
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:54,030
right now.
The problem with Peter Pan is he gets to

769
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:56,190
be king,
but it's King of Neverland.

770
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,173
Neverland doesn't exist.
So being king of nothing isn't that 

771
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:01,880
helpful?
Well,

772
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,723
one of the things that you often see 
with people who suffer from depression 

773
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:05,341
and,
and,

774
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:06,174
and not making a blanket statement about
the cause of depression because there's 

775
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:09,504
lots of them,
is that people who don't have enough 

776
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:13,560
order in their life tend to get 
overwhelmed.

777
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,873
So for example,
if someone comes into me and see to see 

778
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:17,934
me and they say they're depressed,
I always asked him a very standard set 

779
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:23,160
of questions.
Do you have a job?

780
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,020
If you don't have a job,
you're really in trouble in our society,

781
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:27,973
first of all,
you,

782
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,813
your biological rhythms tend to go off 
the rails right away because there's no 

783
00:46:30,741 --> 00:46:33,560
reason to go to bed at any particular 
time and there's no reason to get up and

784
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,830
for many people,
if they don't get up at the same time,

785
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:37,963
they follow up the functioning of their 
circadian rhythms and that's enough to 

786
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:41,204
make them depressed right off the bat,
especially if they start napping during 

787
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:45,980
the afternoon.
They don't also don't have a purpose.

788
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,470
People aren't good without a purpose,
and this isn't.

789
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:49,543
This isn't hypothesizing.
We absolutely understand the circuitry 

790
00:46:53,091 --> 00:46:56,330
that underlies positive emotion.
We know how it works.

791
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,313
Almost all the positive emotion that any
of you are likely to experience in your 

792
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:02,300
life will not be a consequence of 
attaining things.

793
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:03,523
It will be a consequence of seeing that 
things are working as you proceed 

794
00:47:06,771 --> 00:47:07,910
towards a goal you value.

795
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,223
That's completely different and you need
to know this because people are often 

796
00:47:11,481 --> 00:47:12,560
stunned.
For example,

797
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:13,394
they finished their phd thesis and their
presupposition is that they're going to 

798
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:17,054
be elated for a month and often instead 
they're actually depressed and they 

799
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:20,804
think,
what,

800
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:21,703
hell I'd been working on this for seven 
years and I handed it in and what do I 

801
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:26,930
do now?
And that's what depresses them,

802
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:27,411
right?
It's the,

803
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,640
what do I do now?
Well,

804
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:31,300
they're fine if they enjoyed it,
pursuing the thing,

805
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,223
as long as it was working out,
they get a lot of enthusiasm and 

806
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:36,190
excitement out of that because that's 
how our nervous systems work.

807
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,220
Most of your positive emotion is goal 
pursuit,

808
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,083
emotion.
If you take drugs like cocaine or 

809
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:42,544
amphetamine,
the reason they're enjoyable is because 

810
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:46,420
they turn on the systems that help you 
pursue goals.

811
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,560
That's why people like them.

812
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,230
So if you don't have a job,
you got no structure,

813
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,230
that's not good.
Plus you tend not to have a point.

814
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,693
So you're overwhelmed by chaotic lack of
structure and you don't have any 

815
00:47:57,101 --> 00:47:58,180
positive emotion.
Well,

816
00:47:58,181 --> 00:47:59,014
do you have any friends?
So sometimes you see people who are 

817
00:48:01,001 --> 00:48:02,080
depressed,
they have no job,

818
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,660
they have no friends,
they have no intimate relationship,

819
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:05,703
they have an additional health problem,
and they have a drug and alcohol 

820
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:10,000
problem.
My experience has been,

821
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:14,470
if you have three of those problems,
it's almost impossible to help you.

822
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:15,843
You're so deeply mired in chaos that you
can't get out because you make progress 

823
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:21,700
on one front and one of the other 
problems pulls you down.

824
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,730
So one of the things I tell people who 
are depressed is like,

825
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,990
don't sacrifice your stability.
Get a job.

826
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,060
Even if it's not the job you exactly 
want,

827
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:32,530
get a damn job.
You need a job.

828
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,100
Find some friends,
get out in the dating circuit,

829
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,650
see if you can establish an intimate 
relationship.

830
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:39,663
Put together some of the foundation 
litems that that are like pillars that 

831
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:45,400
you're life rests on.
Well that's the practical thing to do.

832
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,880
So that's one example with regards to 
depression.

833
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,170
Well the thing is you don't just launch 
it on them.

834
00:48:56,171 --> 00:48:58,960
You know,
you got to negotiate with the person and

835
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:01,240
you also got to teach them to negotiate 
with themselves.

836
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:03,220
And this is something that's very useful
to know,

837
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,263
you know,
you can tear an eis yourself into doing 

838
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,810
things,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

839
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,673
What I would recommend that instead is 
that you ask yourself what you're 

840
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:13,030
willing to do.
It's a really effective technique.

841
00:49:13,031 --> 00:49:15,190
It's like a meditative techniques.
So for example,

842
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,870
you can get up in the morning and you 
can take,

843
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:17,831
well,
you know,

844
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:20,530
I'd like to have a good day to day.
So I'd like to go to bed tonight without

845
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:23,980
feeling guilty because I didn't do some 
things I said I was going to do and I,

846
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,873
you know,
I'd like to have kind of an interesting 

847
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:26,374
day.
So you've got to fulfill my 

848
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:29,170
responsibilities and I want to enjoy the
day.

849
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:30,820
Then you can ask yourself,
well,

850
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,933
okay,
what would I have to do in order for 

851
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:35,200
that to happen?
That I would do?

852
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,620
And the probability if you practice this
for three or four days,

853
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:39,820
is your brain will just tell you.
They'll say,

854
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:40,241
well,
you know,

855
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:42,760
there's that piece of homework that you 
haven't done for like three weeks.

856
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:43,594
You should knock that sucker off because
it will only take you 10 minutes and 

857
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:49,540
you've been avoiding it and torturing 
yourself to death for 72 hours straight,

858
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:50,374
and if you do that,
here's a little interesting thing you 

859
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:52,624
can do and you know maybe this is a 
little obligations you should clean up 

860
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:55,864
and so what you do in a situation like 
that as you teach the person to 

861
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:01,630
negotiate with themselves say,
well,

862
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:04,030
let's figure out what your aims are.
You gotta have some names,

863
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,830
whatever they are,
and they might say,

864
00:50:05,831 --> 00:50:07,540
well,
I'm so depressed I don't have any aims.

865
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,261
And then I say,
well,

866
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:09,094
pick the least objectionable of the Ames
and act it out for awhile and see what 

867
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:13,870
happens.
Because sometimes your emotional,

868
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,303
your emotional systems are so followed 
up that you have to pretend you have to 

869
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:21,100
act the thing out before you can start 
to believe it.

870
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,113
I mean,
people always assume they have to 

871
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:23,910
believe in then act,
but.

872
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,230
But that's sometimes that's true in lots
of times.

873
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,980
It isn't.
So the trick,

874
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,873
if you're doing therapeutic work with 
somebody and you're helping them 

875
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,690
establish a structure,
is to find out what they'll do.

876
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,690
Now,
if they want to get better,

877
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:40,310
which is not a given because there are 
often payoffs for not getting better.

878
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,653
That's basically the payoffs of being a 
martyr or maybe the payoffs of doing 

879
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:45,044
what you're entirely pathological family
members want you to do because they 

880
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:48,980
actually want you to fail.

881
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,030
Assuming you want to get better.
There's usually something you can figure

882
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:56,570
out that would constitute a step towards
some sort of concrete goal.

883
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,853
And my presumption,
it's a behavioral presumptions 

884
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:04,870
fundamentally is that small accruing 
gains that repeat unbelievably powerful.

885
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:10,100
So this is another thing to know about 
in your own life.

886
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:10,934
It's something I learned in part from 
reading the writings of Alexander 

887
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:13,943
Solzhenitsyn.
He was a great Russian philosopher and 

888
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:16,760
novelist.
He said,

889
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:20,270
you can look at your life and you can 
see what isn't right about it.

890
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:24,230
We know you have to do is look,
and then you can start to fix that.

891
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:29,120
And the way you fix it is by noticing 
what you could in fact fix.

892
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,513
You know,
people are often trying to fix things 

893
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:32,174
they can fix,
which I would not recommend because if 

894
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:35,870
you try to fix something you can't text,
you'll just ruin it.

895
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,960
Like you can find all sorts of 
undergraduates who are perfectly willing

896
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:40,640
to restructure the,
uh,

897
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:41,474
you know,
the international economic system who 

898
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:46,940
cannot keep the room clean and there's 
actually a gap there,

899
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,073
which,
and it's surprising that people don't 

900
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:51,860
actually notice.
So I would say if you pay attention,

901
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:54,620
you can see things that you could fix.
They yell at you,

902
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,230
they really do.
We even know how that happens.

903
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,110
Let me,
let me give you an example because rooms

904
00:52:00,111 --> 00:52:04,040
are full of stories and the stories have
have effects on you.

905
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:04,874
So here's a classic experiment.
So you take two groups of 

906
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:08,294
undergraduates,
you bring them into your lab and you 

907
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:13,730
give one group a multiple choice test 
that has a bunch of words in it that are

908
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:17,510
associated with being old and you give 
the other group the same multiple choice

909
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:19,640
test except the words are associated 
with being young.

910
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,160
This is independent of the content of 
the test.

911
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,790
It's just descriptions.
And then you time the undergraduate says

912
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:28,610
they walked back to the elevators,
the ones who read,

913
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,653
the ones who completed the multiple 
choice tests that had more words 

914
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:32,204
associated with aging,
walk slower back to the elevators and 

915
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:35,324
they don't know that and they don't know
they're doing it and that that study's 

916
00:52:38,181 --> 00:52:40,190
been replicated in various forms.
Many,

917
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:41,024
many times.
You're unbelievably sensitive to the 

918
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:45,590
story that your environment is telling 
you because your environment is not made

919
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:47,570
out of objects.
That's just wrong.

920
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,210
Your environment is basically made out 
of something like tools,

921
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:52,340
that obstacles you're a tool using 
creature,

922
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,070
you a tool perceiving creature,
the things you like.

923
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,390
If I take you out of this room and I 
said,

924
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:57,320
well,
what was in the room?

925
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,650
You're not going to say,
uh,

926
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,213
you know,
random patterns in the carpet because 

927
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,640
they're real or just as good an object 
as anything else.

928
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,510
You're going to say chairs because you 
can sit on them and you're gonna.

929
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:08,363
Say handrails because you can hold them.
You can say stairs because you can walk 

930
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:12,470
down them.
That's what you see.

931
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,453
And that's what you interact with.
And if you pay attention to your 

932
00:53:14,721 --> 00:53:16,160
environment,
which is you,

933
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:18,800
by the way,
extended all of your experiences,

934
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:20,330
you,
it will tell you all the time,

935
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:22,100
what you should do,
all you have to do is do it.

936
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,260
But then you have to decide if you want 
to do it.

937
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,700
One of the things I've noticed about 
people,

938
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:27,534
because I've wondered once I started 
studying these mythological stories and 

939
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:30,534
I got this idea about the fact that life
can be meaningful enough to justify its 

940
00:53:36,081 --> 00:53:36,901
suffering.
I thought,

941
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:39,180
God,
that's such a good idea because it's not

942
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:40,380
optimistic.
Exactly.

943
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:41,610
You know,
some people will tell you what,

944
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:42,420
you can be happy.

945
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,940
It's like those people are idiots.
I'm telling you,

946
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:45,774
they're idiots.
There's going to be things that come 

947
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:47,604
along that flat new so hard,
you won't believe it and you're not 

948
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:51,324
happy then.
And so if life is to be happy while in 

949
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,480
those situations,
what are you doing?

950
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,970
Why are you even live?
But let isn't.

951
00:53:56,971 --> 00:53:58,920
Life isn't to be happy.
If you're happy,

952
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:00,870
you're bloody fortunate and you should 
enjoy it.

953
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,820
You should,
because it's the grace of God,

954
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:06,090
so to speak,
with regards to meaning,

955
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,793
I thought,
well,

956
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,960
people know when they're doing something
meaningful,

957
00:54:09,961 --> 00:54:12,060
they can tell,
so why the hell don't they do meaningful

958
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:15,030
things all the time?
It seems obvious you could do it.

959
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,670
I mean it's hard,
you know,

960
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:19,290
because other people want you to do 
other things and it's a struggle,

961
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:21,720
but everything's a struggle and then I 
thought,

962
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:22,740
well,
oh,

963
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:23,190
I get it.

964
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,500
I see why it took me about 10 years to 
figure this out.

965
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,050
People have a choice.
Choice number one,

966
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,660
nothing you do means anything.
Well,

967
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:31,890
that's kind of a drag,
right?

968
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,920
Meaninglessness of life and all that 
existential angst,

969
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,510
you know,
that's kind of a pain,

970
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,463
but the upside of nothing that you do be
mean is meaningful is you don't have to 

971
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:43,950
do anything.
You've got no responsibility.

972
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,813
No,
you have to suffer because things are 

973
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:46,314
meaningless,
but that's a small price to pay for 

974
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:51,450
being able to be completely useless.
The alternative,

975
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,450
the alternative is everything you do 
matters.

976
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,850
Really,
if you make a mistake,

977
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,640
it's a real mistake.
If you be someone,

978
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,540
you tilt the world a little more sharply
towards evil rather than good,

979
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,420
it matters what you do well.
If you buy that,

980
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:09,900
then you can have a meaningful life,
but there's no mucking around.

981
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,950
It means responsibility.
It means that the decisions you make are

982
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:14,784
important.
It means that when you do something 

983
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:18,210
wrong,
it's wrong.

984
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:20,460
Well,
do you want that?

985
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,073
See,
that's a very hard question because 

986
00:55:25,891 --> 00:55:28,980
people don't always mean the same thing 
when they say their own moral compass.

987
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,150
Now,
so at here,

988
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,983
here,
here's.

989
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:34,290
Here's what I mean by that.
Technically part of the way,

990
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,153
the reason that you're able to 
distinguish between right and wrong is 

991
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:37,734
because you are a certain kind of 
biological organism and then another 

992
00:55:40,621 --> 00:55:43,530
reason is that your head is full of 
other people,

993
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,630
right?
All the people you've met,

994
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:46,464
all the people that you've interacted 
with their own telling you a way to 

995
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:53,010
behave that's good in a way that isn't.
There are circumstances under which your

996
00:55:53,011 --> 00:55:55,830
conscience should,
the or the duty you have to.

997
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:58,860
Your conscience should override the duty
you have to social norms,

998
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,383
but before you break a rule because you 
think you're going to be doing a good 

999
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:06,174
thing,
you bloody well better make sure you 

1000
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:08,454
have your head screwed on straight 
because every time you tell yourself a 

1001
00:56:10,921 --> 00:56:13,050
lie and every time you act out a 
falsehood,

1002
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:14,363
you disturbed the pristine integrity of 
your nervous system and the reports 

1003
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:22,380
it'll give you about the nature of the 
world will be distorted as a consequence

1004
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:23,214
of that.

1005
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,203
So yeah,
you have a moral obligation to follow 

1006
00:56:25,531 --> 00:56:26,364
the dictates of your conscience,
but you also have a moral obligation to 

1007
00:56:29,161 --> 00:56:29,994
make sure that your life is straightened
out so that you can rely on your own 

1008
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:34,260
judgment and you can't separate those 
things.
