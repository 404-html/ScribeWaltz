1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,970
When I started working on this problem,
or I guess when,

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,893
when it started working on me,
it was probably really in the mid 

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,710
eighties and I found myself suffering 
from two things.

4
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:20,160
One was a very lengthy sequence of 
nightmares about nuclear destruction,

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,253
and they were very as affecting dreams 
and associated with that was a sense of 

6
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,960
amazement.
That dream that was,

7
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:34,794
that awful could reflect a reality that 
could be that awful and an additional 

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,013
amazement at the fact that despite the 
production of thousands and tens and 

9
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:48,864
thousands of weapons of unimaginable 
destruction and the qualitative 

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,713
qualitative change in human capacity 
that represented that people could go 

11
00:00:58,951 --> 00:00:59,784
about their day to day lives without 
acting as if anything fundamental 

12
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:06,340
whatsoever had changed.
Now,

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,253
I've never really been able to figure 
out why that disturbed me so much when 

14
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:14,910
it seemed to not disturb to any profound
degree.

15
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:18,420
Most of the people I knew but doesn't 
really matter.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,473
Um,
the upshot of it was of it was that I 

17
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:24,930
spent.
I probably spent my whole life trying to

18
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,020
understand what evil was and more 
importantly,

19
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,370
what might be done about it.
Um,

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,633
it's a strange pursuit in some ways for 
an academic done undertake because 

21
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,410
academics tend to talk about academic 
things.

22
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:40,170
And one thing you can say about evil is 
that whatever it is,

23
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:44,940
it's not bloody well academic,
it's not an intellectual issue,

24
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,680
it's an existential issue and it's not a
theoretical issue,

25
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:50,514
it's an,
it's an issue that deals with that 

26
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,843
absolute nature of reality.
And I guess sometimes I think that 

27
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,700
people go into academia,
go into academia,

28
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:00,534
did shield themselves from having to ask
questions about the absolute nature of 

29
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:07,380
reality.
So anyways,

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,993
I think before you can talk about 
something before you can dare to talk 

31
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:12,744
about something like evil,
you should do some thinking about what 

32
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,450
it is that you're talking about is 
definitionally speaking.

33
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,003
I learned this,
I believe from historian named Jeffrey 

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,833
Burton,
Russell,

35
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,823
who wrote a very detailed history of the
idea of the devil and the 19 eighties 

36
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:34,020
when such histories were,
were strange to say the least.

37
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,950
He was very interested in the history of
the embodiment of ideas of evil.

38
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:38,784
And one of the things he his work did 
for me was to help me clarify the 

39
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:46,620
distinction between two terrible things,
the distinction,

40
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,683
a distinction that has to be made,
and that's the distinction between 

41
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,244
tragedy and evil and I don't think you 
can talk about it evil at all until you 

42
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:54,414
distinguish it from tragedy.
And so I'm going to try to distinguish 

43
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:57,864
evil from tragedy by making some 
reference to the essential existential 

44
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,294
condition of human beings.
I would say that the nature of human 

45
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,970
being is such that it consists of a 
confrontation with the bounded finite,

46
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:10,804
with the unbounded infinite,
and those are the bare facts of the 

47
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:14,500
matter.

48
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,333
And the facts are that the,
the world of experience as it presents 

49
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,983
itself to us is literally and not 
metaphorically complex beyond our 

50
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,624
capacity to understand.
And that means that people deal in a 

51
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:32,440
real sense on an ongoing basis with the 
infinite.

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,513
And I believe that that fact is the 
reason why religious experiences 

53
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,770
essentially and belief is essentially 
endemic to mankind.

54
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,753
It's a human universal and it's not 
because people believe it's because 

55
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,020
human existence as such consists of a 
confrontation between the finite and the

56
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,080
infinite and religious systems merely 
take that into account.

57
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,670
Now,
our finitude in the face of the infinite

58
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,504
has some inevitable consequences and I 
would say those consequences are 

59
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:03,670
essentially the existential conditions 
of life.

60
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,073
The first of those consequences is that 
the finite is always overwhelmed by the 

61
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,244
infinite.
It has to be because it can't 

62
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,560
encapsulate it,
and so what that means is that it's that

63
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,394
suffering is central to the nature of 
human existence and suffering exists as 

64
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:22,480
a consequence of the consequences of our
limitations.

65
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,183
I mean every single person who's alive 
is going to die and every single person 

66
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,194
who's alive,
who's going to deal with with serious 

67
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:34,060
physical illness and mental distress,
if they don't suffer,

68
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,690
if they aren't suffering directly 
immediately right now on their own,

69
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,973
it's almost inevitably the case that 
every single person who walks the earth 

70
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,523
is confronting the bare bones of reality
at that level in the guise of an 

71
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:47,574
afflicted family member.
And so the fact of our affinity duties 

72
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,161
is,
again,

73
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:51,994
no academic issue,
it's essential to the nature of our 

74
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:57,820
being and we're forced to deal with it 
on an ongoing basis.

75
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,943
So I would say insufficiency is built 
into human experience and their 

76
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,480
existential consequences to that.

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,563
Now,
I read something a long time ago and I 

78
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,334
don't remember who wrote it,
but it was written about Jewish 

79
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:18,400
commentary on the Torah.
God Is Omniscient,

80
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,720
omnipotent and omnipresent.
What does he lack?

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,240
Announcers,
limitation.

82
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,220
And that's,
that's a,

83
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,083
that's a riddle and announcer of 
unparalleled brilliance as far as I'm 

84
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:31,024
concerned because I think it speaks 
deeply to something about the central 

85
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:37,720
nature of existence itself and that is 
without limitation.

86
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:41,170
There's no being.
Now that's a hard thing to understand,

87
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:43,810
but I think you can understand it in a 
number of different ways.

88
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,003
The first thing you might want to 
understand is that I played this game 

89
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,414
with my students sometimes in my class.
I'll come up to a student to pick them 

90
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:54,490
at poor victim at random and come up to 
them and say,

91
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:55,540
okay,
we're going to play a game.

92
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,680
Say I.
They say,

93
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:58,371
okay,
and I say,

94
00:05:58,371 --> 00:05:59,204
well,
you move first and they don't know what 

95
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:01,574
to do,
and the reason for that is because the 

96
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:04,394
limiting parameters of the game of not 
being defined and as a consequence of 

97
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:07,784
that,
they're are stunned by their infinite 

98
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:10,650
freedom into complete and mobility.

99
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,580
And what that means in a sense is that 
the,

100
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,610
in the absence of serious constraint,
there can be no choice,

101
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,140
no freedom,
no existence,

102
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,410
and I believe this to be fundamentally 
true,

103
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,910
just as the fact that human being as 
vulnerable is fundamentally true.

104
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,810
Here's another example I think is more,
it's more personal to me,

105
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,033
and it emerged in my imagination as a 
consequence of my contemplation of my 

106
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:34,514
son's vulnerability.
So I have children that are teenagers 

107
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:39,470
now.
I still like them.

108
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,740
Um,
am i.

109
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,573
One of the things I was really struck by
when my children were little was how 

110
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,634
perfect they were like,
and I believe that that was the 

111
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,040
benevolence of God.
In a sense.

112
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,100
Children are tremendously difficult.
They're tremendous responsibility,

113
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,650
but they're so perfect and they manifest
that perfection in such a,

114
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,753
a remarkable way that that's the payment
for taking on the responsibility of 

115
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,090
bringing them into the B,
into being,

116
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:05,930
in caring for them.

117
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,930
And the thing about being a parent is 
that the vulnerability of people is made

118
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:15,200
manifest to you in a way that was never 
the case prior to that.

119
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,530
And it's not.
It's haunting and it's beautiful,

120
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,230
but it's also exactly right in a way.
And I was thinking,

121
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,100
well,
look at my son,

122
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:22,934
he's a little kid and you know,
you've got to chase after him all the 

123
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,460
time.
You can get sick.

124
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,990
People heard him,
uh,

125
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:28,310
you know,
people are going to be mean to him.

126
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:30,020
He's going to be disappointed in his 
life.

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,950
He's vulnerable and,
and it's,

128
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,300
it's,
it's a constant tragic reality that he's

129
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:36,051
vulnerable.
And I thought,

130
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:36,410
well,
okay,

131
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,420
let's say we wanted to do something 
about that.

132
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:41,690
So let's say we make them so that no one
can pick on him.

133
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:46,340
So he could inflate them to about 20 
feet high and equip them with a metallic

134
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,010
scout.

135
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,090
And and uh,
and a cast iron exoskeleton,

136
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:50,924
and you could equip them with a 
computerized intelligence that far 

137
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:54,824
supersedes his own and you could remove 
his vulnerabilities one by one 

138
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:58,364
hypothetically,
and of course more and more we're in a 

139
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:01,610
position where we could do that in 
reality.

140
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,653
And one of the things I realized right 
away was that as you remove the 

141
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:07,280
vulnerabilities,
you remove the thing you love.

142
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,223
And then I started to understand more 
deeply that vulnerability was a 

143
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,123
precondition for human being and that 
was a desirable preconditioned because 

144
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,383
the things about human existence that 
are wonderful and remarkable are so 

145
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:25,460
integrally tied up with vulnerability 
that they're actually inextricable.

146
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,830
The Jewish commentary.
What the infinite lacks is the finite is

147
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:36,140
a more abstract way of getting at the 
same thing.

148
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,563
If you could do absolutely anything you 
wanted at any point and be anywhere you 

149
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:42,790
want it to be,
anything you wanted,

150
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,653
and if,
if there was nothing that was out of 

151
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:46,004
your reach,
there would be nothing to do because 

152
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:51,230
you'd be everything at once.
And when you're everything at once,

153
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,930
which is at least in principle,
the position of God.

154
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,450
There's no story,
there's no being,

155
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:58,284
and there's something about being that 
is a story and without limitation 

156
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:01,464
there's no story,
so then the question starts to become 

157
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,670
with regards to consideration of human 
vulnerability,

158
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,923
is there a way to conduct your life in 
such a manner that the intrinsic 

159
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:15,741
vulnerability that characterizes your 
life is rendered not only acceptable but

160
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,870
desirable,
and to me that's the central question of

161
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,790
existence and I tell you I get that 
wrong.

162
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,430
You're on the wrong track and if you're 
on the wrong track,

163
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,920
man,
you are in one terrible place.

164
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,100
I would say with regards to tragedy,
right?

165
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,273
Humans are vulnerable and that's tragic,
but if tragedy is the price that we pay 

166
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:36,590
for existence,
then so be it.

167
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:40,250
If existence is justifiable and so 
tragedy itself,

168
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:42,440
which is merely a revelation of our 
vulnerability,

169
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,040
can't be regarded as evil.
It's just A.

170
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,250
It's a condition of existence and so 
it's necessary to distinguish the tragic

171
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,590
conditions of existence from evil before
you can even address the problem.

172
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,573
And I think what that means to some 
degree is you should not blame on the 

173
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,890
relationship between the finite and the 
infinite.

174
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,043
The terrible failings of humanity that 
can be laid directly at the feet of 

175
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:07,034
human beings,
so earthquakes aren't evil and cancer 

176
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:13,990
isn't evil and mental illness isn't evil
and predators aren't evil.

177
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,940
They just are part of the way things 
are,

178
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,980
but there are certain categories of 
human action that are definitely outside

179
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:22,814
the parameters of mirror tragedy and 
those are the things we really have to 

180
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:26,180
get a handle on.

181
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,803
Evil for me is differentiated from 
tragedy by its lack of necessity and 

182
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,624
it's volunteerism and its attendant.
I think of modern materialistic thought 

183
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,003
that there are social or material causes
for actions and it's an extraordinarily 

184
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:47,314
useful theory and I think,
but I think one of the unfortunate 

185
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,153
consequences of that is that we've 
tended to write off much of human 

186
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:57,460
misbehavior and attributed to say 
insufficiencies and material conditions,

187
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:58,570
which isn't.
It's not an.

188
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,733
It's not an acceptable theory.
There are all sorts of human cultures 

189
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:03,634
that were characterized by virtually 
complete absence of material luxury 

190
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:11,530
wellbeing,
whose culture is we're highly functional

191
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,364
and highly moral,
and to describe the propensity towards 

192
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:20,860
misbehavior as a consequence of economic
inequality is entirely beside the point.

193
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:21,880
As far as I'm concerned,

194
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,790
evil is more pernicious than that which 
has generated,

195
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,740
for example,
by social inequality.

196
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,860
I think it's actually,
although this is a terrifying thought,

197
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:34,694
in some ways it's more appropriate to 
consider it a form of a demonically 

198
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,163
warped aesthetic,
and I'll give you a couple of examples 

199
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:47,120
of what I mean by that,
for example,

200
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,140
because the exam,
because the manifestation of this warped

201
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:55,210
athetic aesthetic makes itself apparent 
under certain conditions.

202
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:56,044
So for example,
I think it made itself apparent in the 

203
00:11:58,721 --> 00:11:59,554
imagination of the first politician who 
coined the acronym a mad or mutually 

204
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:09,151
assured destruction.
That's an aesthetic of evil to to make a

205
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,054
joke of a situation that catastrophic 
indicates the kind of malevolence that 

206
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:19,060
lurks behind the fact that such a 
condition exists.

207
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,223
The motto on the gates of Auschwitz,
I believe in the Second World War work 

208
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,934
will make you free.
That's another manifestation of this 

209
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:32,710
authentic of evil.
It's a terrible,

210
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,544
terrible,
ironic joke and it's instructive to 

211
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,284
meditate on what sort of imagination 
would have the arrogance to tell such a 

212
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,100
terrible joke.

213
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,120
The concentration camps are classic 
examples of evil one,

214
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,223
I think by an analyzing at least certain
kinds of events that occurred within 

215
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:55,004
them,
it's easier to get a clear idea of what 

216
00:12:56,781 --> 00:13:00,200
evil constitutes in one of the stories.
It's always haunted me,

217
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,034
I guess is,
I believe it's another story derived 

218
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:03,344
from Auschwitz.
The prison guards in Auschwitz would 

219
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,284
take the prisoners who were already 
stripped of their dignity and to 

220
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:12,830
whatever degree possible their identity 
and their culture and their language and

221
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,580
their status of as valuable beings.
And yet that wasn't sufficient.

222
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,780
They needed to be tortured in addition 
to that before they were killed.

223
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,060
And the torture often consisted of a 
self evidently counterproductive work.

224
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,480
Uh,
uh,

225
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,493
a situation that also frequently 
characterized activity in the Soviet 

226
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:34,940
Gulag archipelago where perhaps 60 
million people met their death.

227
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,093
A typical Auschwitz example was the 
requirement for prisoners to carry 100 

228
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:45,130
pound sacks of wet salt from one side of
the compound and then back again.

229
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,643
Now that's evil as far as I'm concerned 
and and you have to think about it from 

230
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:54,151
an aesthetic perspective in a sense 
because it's a celebration of horror and

231
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,153
it's a.
it's a conscious attempt to violate the 

232
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,283
conditions that make life itself 
tolerable and it's aimed at 

233
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,063
dehumanization destruction of the ideal 
and at an even deeper level revenge 

234
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:12,040
against the conditions of existence 
itself.

235
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,470
I've tried to understand it.
Developmental pathway that leads to acts

236
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:18,304
like that.
My academic research as well as my 

237
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:24,824
clinical experience has revealed to me 
that what appears to lie at the bottom 

238
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:31,214
of motivation for the excesses of 
behavior that characterize evil are too 

239
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,930
tightly,
causally related factors.

240
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,443
One arrogance and other resentment and 
both of those are tied up with 

241
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,490
vulnerability of human beings

242
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,600
in the face of the infinite,
but

243
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,070
but tied up with something more profound
as well.

244
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,790
The most thorough account of this that 
I've managed,

245
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,710
I think,
at least a partially comprehend,

246
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,843
I believe is contained in the first 
couple of the stories in the Old 

247
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:14,250
Testament,
in Genesis,

248
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,953
the story of Adam and eve in the fall of
man and the immediately following story 

249
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:20,700
of Cain and Abel.

250
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,740
As far as we can tell,
those are very,

251
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:26,860
very old stories.
They predate Judaism,

252
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,110
at least in some of their in some of 
their structural elements.

253
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,723
It's conceivable that some of the 
elements in those stories are as old as 

254
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:38,200
the human capacity to tell stories 
itself,

255
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,460
assuming that they were grounded in an 
oral tradition that predated the written

256
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:43,294
tradition and we know that oral 
traditions can last at least in some 

257
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:48,790
forms unchanged for periods of up to 
25,000

258
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,700
years.
So the anthropological and archeological

259
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,940
evidence is fairly clear on that point.
These are very,

260
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:55,774
very,
very old stories and people remember 

261
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:58,814
them and created them for reasons we 
really don't understand and they're 

262
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,860
strange and mysterious and unforgettable
all at the same time.

263
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,520
The story of Adam and Eve as far as I 
can tell,

264
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,090
is the story of the coming of 
consciousness,

265
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,460
the coming of self consciousness to 
mankind,

266
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,620
and I think that the human,

267
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,943
the,

268
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,180
the human human self consciousness is 
what separates us from animals.

269
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,153
In Genesis.
There's an insistence that went out to 

270
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:32,304
meet the apple that eve offered to him.
The scales fell from his eyes and the 

271
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,470
first thing that he realized was that he
was naked.

272
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,140
And what that seems to me to mean is 
that,

273
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,760
I mean,
I think it means first of all,

274
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:42,594
that women make men self conscious and I
think there's ample reason to presume 

275
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:48,870
that and there's good evolutionary 
reasons for suggesting why that might be

276
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:53,850
the case because sexual selection among 
human beings has been a primary force of

277
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:54,684
evolutionary development.
And sexual selection in human beings is 

278
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,430
primarily conducted by women.
So for example,

279
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:06,270
as Roy has pointed out in his address to
the APA a few years ago,

280
00:17:06,271 --> 00:17:09,490
and I hope I get this right twice as 
many of your relatives who were women as

281
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:10,410
well as men.

282
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,423
And that means that women are more 
frequently reproductively successful 

283
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,553
than men,
and that they reject most Matt and the 

284
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:19,854
rejection of a man for reproductive 
purposes by a woman is the most serious 

285
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:23,814
form of rejection that's possible from 
an evolutionary point of view because 

286
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:29,010
the judgment is that what you might be 
nice enough to talk to,

287
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,883
whoever you're sure not fit to have your
genes propagate into the next 

288
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:33,054
generation.
So it's no wonder that women can make 

289
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:37,020
self,
make men self conscious.

290
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:37,854
And I think there's some reason to 
presume that it's the sexual selection 

291
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:44,520
forces that women placed upon man that 
drove rapid human cortical evolution and

292
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,354
the development of self consciousness.
Now that's a leap and then there's no 

293
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:51,450
way I can justify that the course of 
this particular talk.

294
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:56,130
But I think there is good reason to 
presume that it's the case in genesis.

295
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,963
Human beings become self conscious and 
the first thing that happens to them is 

296
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,024
that they realized they they're naked.
And then the next thing that happens to 

297
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:02,454
them as they develop the moral sense to 
tell the difference between good and 

298
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:06,930
evil.
And it's a very strange thing because in

299
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:09,270
some sense,
before our creature is self conscious,

300
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:12,480
there is no distinction between good and
evil because as I said before,

301
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,300
a Predator is not evil.
It's just a predator.

302
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,080
The fact of a Predator like a wolf might
be a tragedy for the rabbit,

303
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:19,914
but you can't be assuming that the wolf 
is evil merely because it wants to eat 

304
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,124
the rabbit.
But with the dawning of self 

305
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:28,470
consciousness,
there there seems to be the emergence of

306
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:29,304
a moral sense that's essentially unique 
to human beings and that has something 

307
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:36,900
to do with our capacity to reflect upon 
the mechanisms of our action.

308
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:40,830
And then for some reason to be able to 
modify those actions and to choose which

309
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:43,020
ones to implement into the future and 
the future.

310
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,973
We don't understand that and you can 
even deny if you'd like that the the 

311
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,443
phenomena of free choice exists.
But our culture is essentially 

312
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,680
predicated on the notion that it does 
exist.

313
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,990
And in the absence of evidence that it 
doesn't.

314
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,510
I'm going to take the easy way out and 
assume that it does.

315
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,033
Otherwise,
things fall apart and they fall apart 

316
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:01,074
badly

317
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,293
when

318
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,050
after Adam and eve become self 
conscious,

319
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,480
the first thing they do is closed 
themselves and to me,

320
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,314
that's a mythological description of the
emergence of culture as an intercession 

321
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:15,414
between the Ne,
the fundamental vulnerability and 

322
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:20,610
nakedness of the human form and the 
depredations of nature.

323
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,880
If you realize that you're vulnerable 
and prone to death,

324
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:24,714
the first thing you're going to do is to
start rearranging the manner in which 

325
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:27,774
you construe yourself so that you can 
protect yourself from suction 

326
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,793
unfortunate outcome.
So I think partly why God curses Adam 

327
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,880
with the necessity of work.
Once he finds out,

328
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,430
once God finds out that people have 
become self conscious,

329
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:42,000
like if you know that what's the winter 
is lurking in the future,

330
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:42,834
for example,
you are going to work and animals don't 

331
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:45,204
work.
They're just motivated to do whatever 

332
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:47,004
they do,
but humans work and that means they 

333
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:48,834
subvert their day to day motivations,
their immediate motivations for the 

334
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:56,490
purposes of future security.
And there's a real cost to that.

335
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,653
Part of the cost is separation from the 
pure and unadulterated flow of animal 

336
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:02,784
life.
And I believe that people suffer from 

337
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:08,841
that absence of flow continually and 
and,

338
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,280
and the advantage that they gained from 
it is that they can plan for the future,

339
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:14,114
but the disadvantages that they are 
calculating and cold and separated from 

340
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,530
their own instinctual resources,

341
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,331
eve,
of course,

342
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:27,331
is cursed by what's going to be terrible
pain in childbirth and that's related to

343
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:28,384
the development of the immense skull 
size that characterizes human infants 

344
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,490
and they're incredibly lengthy period of
dependence,

345
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:39,190
which is also associated with their 
immense spring

346
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,640
after Adam and eve become self 
conscious.

347
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,990
They hide and this is actually a comical
of genesis.

348
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:50,600
It's never really read as a comedy,
but it is a comedy.

349
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:55,550
Even the fall itself as a comedy,
and so they're hiding away behind a Bush

350
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,130
and God comes to walking through the 
garden.

351
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:58,964
And God,
the infinite is accustomed to walking 

352
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:06,320
without him with no interruption of the 
flow of information between them.

353
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,620
Madame is narrowed and God says,
you know,

354
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,900
where,
where have you gone?

355
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:12,860
And Adam says,
well,

356
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,840
I'm hiding.
And God says,

357
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,590
which is kind of stupid really?
And this is why it's a common.

358
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:20,290
It's like he's hiding behind a bush.
This is God,

359
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,124
and he can see through bushes and like 
Adam should know that it doesn't really 

360
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:25,220
matter.
He's hiding out in this Bush anyways.

361
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,470
And uh,
and got so Adam says,

362
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm hiding.
And God says,

363
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:29,930
well,
why are you know,

364
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,100
what,
why are you hiding?

365
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,790
Because Adam's ashamed.
And Adam says,

366
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,230
well,
I'm naked.

367
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,623
And this is an example of the tremendous
compression of human wisdom into a few 

368
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:44,150
lines that characterizes mythologies.
Say,

369
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:46,700
well,
why would people hide from God once they

370
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:48,410
realized they're naked?
And I would say,

371
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:49,370
well,
that's pretty obvious.

372
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,280
Once you know you're vulnerable.
All right.

373
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:53,114
Do you really have enough courage to 
manifest any sort of semblance of a 

374
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:57,350
divine destiny?
Well,

375
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:59,240
the answer that is pretty much clearly 
know,

376
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:00,074
and it's no bloody wonder.
And so the hiding is people hide when 

377
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:04,050
they're self conscious and vulnerable.
No.

378
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,860
Are they hide from them?
They hide from their deepest destiny and

379
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:09,260
it's no wonder God says,
okay,

380
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:09,681
yeah,
well,

381
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:11,360
you figured that out.
How that happened?

382
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:12,310
And Adam says,
Mrs.

383
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,303
Carmen was the woman's fault,
which I think is really funny in which 

384
00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:19,070
actually may have been the original sin 
and not the eating of the apple,

385
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,400
right?

386
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,400
The first time that the man blamed the 
woman for his self conscious misery.

387
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:29,390
I think that's the real fall and knock 
the rise of self consciousness itself.

388
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,520
Anyways,
we knew the rest of the story.

389
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,211
God says,
Oh,

390
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:33,500
well,
the cat's out of the bag.

391
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,020
Now you know,
you know you're vulnerable and from here

392
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,720
on in history starts,
you're out of paradise here,

393
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:41,300
out of unconscious identification with 
the natural world,

394
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,120
you're gonna work.
You're gonna sweat.

395
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,030
Lots of the time it isn't going to work,
and women,

396
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,280
they are going to be beholding to their 
husbands,

397
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:53,750
not because that's divine theater,
but because the developmental,

398
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,453
the developmental dependency of the 
human infant is so extreme that women 

399
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,910
are cursed to rely on men for protection
when they're at their most vulnerable,

400
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,513
fine.
So that's self consciousness and an 

401
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:09,050
explanation for why people would hide 
away from their destiny,

402
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:09,884
but then the next story that can enable 
story really elaborates that out and 

403
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:14,930
describes it.
And so cain and Abel,

404
00:23:14,931 --> 00:23:17,750
of course,
our two sons of Adam and eve,

405
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:21,620
and they're really the first people 
because of course Adam and eve were made

406
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:22,454
by God,
so they're really not people at all 

407
00:23:23,391 --> 00:23:24,224
because people are born and Cain and 
Abel are the first two people and they 

408
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:33,521
characterize as far as I can tell,
to canonical patterns of reaction to the

409
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:34,664
terrible vulnerability that's revealed 
as a consequence of the development of 

410
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:42,701
self consciousness.
Cain and Abel make sacrifices to God.

411
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,543
Why?

412
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,700
Human cultures make sacrifices.
That's what they do.

413
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,590
Sacrifice sacrificial rituals.
A human universal blood sacrifices.

414
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,453
A human universal human sacrifice,
at least in some anthropological at was 

415
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:03,190
regarded as a human universal.
Why do people make sacrifices to God?

416
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,370
To please him?
Seems like a mystery to modern people.

417
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:07,983
I ask my students,
what sacrifices did you make to go to 

418
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:12,670
university?
While they can answer that in two tenths

419
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:13,504
of a second,
they can't party as much as they might 

420
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:15,770
have.
They.

421
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,750
They can't drink nearly as much beer as 
they might've liked to more seriously.

422
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,870
A lot of them work.
A lot of them have put their families in

423
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:23,704
in,
in serious financial straits to send 

424
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,374
them to university.
They've given up all sorts of things in 

425
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:30,004
order to pursue,
pursue a course of action that they 

426
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:32,134
believe will best ensure they're 
harmonious relationship with the nature 

427
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:37,450
of reality.
Everyone makes sacrifices.

428
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:38,284
Okay,
we can say that now because we're a 

429
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:42,400
psychologically sophisticated and 
linguistically sophisticated.

430
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:44,200
We know something about human 
psychology,

431
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,393
but thousands and thousands of years ago
before people had this explicit 

432
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:48,694
psychological acumen,
the best they could do is act out and 

433
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:51,874
tell stories about human psychology 
because they hadn't developed any 

434
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:54,964
further than that.
And cain and Abel is one of those 

435
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:57,304
stories.

436
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,190
The sacrifices are burnt on an altar.
Why?

437
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,370
Well,
the smoke rises well,

438
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,273
so what?
Well go ends up in the sky and if the 

439
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:08,820
smoke rises up there and he gets a whiff
of it,

440
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:09,654
he can tell what the quality of the 
sacrifice was and you can laugh about 

441
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:15,180
that and you can think of.
You can think about a desk primitive,

442
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:16,014
but it's not permitted.
It's artistic and it's beautiful and 

443
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,900
it's.
And it's accurate.

444
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:19,734
And here's why,
is because before the invention of the 

445
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,170
electrical light and maybe before the 
invention of fire,

446
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,913
the closest to human being could ever 
give to direct confrontation with the 

447
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:32,664
absolute unknown,
was to look up at the night sky because 

448
00:25:34,891 --> 00:25:35,724
the night story,
especially when it sprinkled with stars 

449
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,243
confronts you directly with the fact of 
the infinite and to make the 

450
00:25:41,191 --> 00:25:42,024
presupposition that God resides in the 
incident and you're having a direct 

451
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:48,630
experience of the infinite at that 
moment is not a primitive notion.

452
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:49,464
It's a.
it's a very intelligent and creative 

453
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:52,944
hypothesis,
and so the notion that God occupies the 

454
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:57,120
sky,
the days guy being equally as impressive

455
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:59,640
as the night sky is not a primitive 
hypothesis.

456
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,240
It's a reflection of the nature of a 
certain kind of human experience.

457
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,090
You burn something and you send the 
smoke up.

458
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,900
God gets a crack at determining the 
quality of your offering,

459
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,970
the quality of your sacrifice.
Well,

460
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,760
let's get.
Let's be perfectly clear about this.

461
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,200
If your sacrifices aren't first grade,
the nature of your relationship with the

462
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:20,034
infinite is going to suffer dreadfully.
And that's exactly what the story of 

463
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:27,540
Cain and Abel reveals now able.
He's interesting character.

464
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,433
He believes in the nature of experience 
and the nature of existence when he's 

465
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:31,704
called on to make a sacrifice,
he sacrifices the best that he has to 

466
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:36,930
offer and that makes God happy.
And as a consequence,

467
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:39,180
everything that Abel touches turns to 
gold.

468
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,860
Everyone likes him,
they respect him,

469
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,530
his crops multiply.
He's successful women.

470
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,513
Plus he's a wonderful guy,
so you could hardly imagine a more 

471
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,650
annoying creature if you possibly 
attempted to do it.

472
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:50,484
Whereas cain see cain has reacted to his
self consciousness by withdrawing from 

473
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:56,604
the infinite.
And there's a tremendous danger in that 

474
00:26:58,231 --> 00:26:59,064
because it starts to mean that he 
realized purely on his own devious 

475
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:07,140
devices to sale is shipped through the 
shoulders of life.

476
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,593
He believes as his arrogance developed 
as a consequence of his withdrawal from 

477
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,214
the infinite,
the contact that he can't tolerate 

478
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,060
because he can't tolerate his own 
vulnerability.

479
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,940
That he's able to deceive the structure 
of reality itself,

480
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:21,774
to offer second rate sacrifices to God 
himself who can see absolutely 

481
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,820
everything because the infinite is 
absolutely everything and to prevail.

482
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:31,050
Nonetheless,
well,

483
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,943
needless to say,
this does not work and it doesn't work 

484
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:38,850
in an obvious way.
If you talk to people and they reveal to

485
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:43,530
you they're unnecessary suffering,
it's very straightforward to look behind

486
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:47,880
what it is that they have to say.
They'll tell you the poor decisions they

487
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:48,714
made in their lives and the 
opportunities that they didn't take and 

488
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:54,540
the chances that they didn't.
They didn't have enough courage to grasp

489
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:55,374
and the sacrifices they failed to make.
There's nothing mysterious about it and 

490
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,693
their own experiences teach them full 
well that they pathologize the 

491
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:04,800
relationship they have with the nature 
of reality.

492
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,960
Well,
that's a terrible thing.

493
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,903
Well in Kane is dreadfully unhappy.
He's unhappy because nothing he ever 

494
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:11,544
wants happens and that's partly because 
he doesn't really want it because if he 

495
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:14,604
really wanted it,
he'd make the right sacrifices to salt 

496
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:17,724
is rubbed into his wounds by the 
existence of his brother for whom 

497
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:22,860
everything seemed simple,
but of course really isn't.

498
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,143
Cane goes to complain to God and I had 
to read three or four different 

499
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:30,810
translations of these particular verses 
to figure out what this meant.

500
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,670
Penny says,
what in the world is going on here?

501
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,270
I'm marketing myself to the bone.
I'm sacrificing things left,

502
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:41,880
right and center.
Everything I touch turns to dirt.

503
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:46,881
Everything turns against me like what's 
up with the nature of reality canes?

504
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:52,271
Essential vulnerability is revealed and 
exacerbated by his pathological attitude

505
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:55,530
towards his own actions.
God says to him,

506
00:28:55,531 --> 00:29:00,531
essentially sin is a predatory cat that 
crouches at your doorway and leaps on us

507
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,380
will it,
but if you only wanted to,

508
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:05,214
you could master it,
and that is absolutely the last thing 

509
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:09,714
that Kayden wants to hear because if 
things are going from bad to worse for 

510
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:15,750
you and you're playing a causal role in 
it,

511
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,950
there is nothing more horrible than some
that someone can do to you,

512
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,023
but reveal to you in a way that you can 
deny that you're entirely complicit in 

513
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:27,990
your own demise and that's exactly what 
God does to cane,

514
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,550
and so what is can do?

515
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,153
Well,
the logical thing would be listened 

516
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,300
because if the structure of reality 
itself tells you something,

517
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:38,340
it's best to listen since there is no 
way out of it,

518
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:39,174
but that's not what kin does.
He's so incensed by his essential 

519
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:43,804
vulnerability,
compromised and exacerbated by his 

520
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:48,690
failure to make the appropriate 
sacrifices in,

521
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:51,340
to conduct himself appropriately,
that he decides that in there,

522
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,920
number one,
to destroy his ideal,

523
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,023
to reduce the tension that he feels when
that ideal exists as a contrast point 

524
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,510
and number two,
to destroy the favorite son of God,

525
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,860
and so he goes out into the field and 
kills Abel and God comes along and says,

526
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,080
where's my favorite Sonnen?
Cain says,

527
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,970
I killed him and it's so interesting to 
me that that story is placed.

528
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,380
Really it's the third story in the Old 
Testament.

529
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,990
It's,
it's with the archaic stories and it's a

530
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:23,830
story that reveals as far as I can tell,
that there are two essential patterns of

531
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:28,240
reaction to the self conscious,
vulnerable conditions of existence,

532
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:33,241
and one is humble approach to an 
infinity with determined attempt to make

533
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:35,950
the appropriate sacrifices.

534
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,900
The other is arrogance,
resentment,

535
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,620
the keeping of everything good for 
oneself and the degeneration of the soul

536
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:43,990
into something that's homicidally 
murderous.

537
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,230
Well,
the story doesn't stop there and it gets

538
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:50,680
really compressed in this part and 
that's perhaps because some of it's been

539
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:53,800
lost with the passages of time,
but the next thing that happens is that,

540
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,270
well,
God doesn't punish cane anything.

541
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,780
That's Kinda strange.
I mean the Old Testament God,

542
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:03,100
he's punishing people left,
right,

543
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:03,911
and center.
It's right.

544
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:06,340
Why not cane and you think,
well,

545
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,323
he marks cane and he says to the people 
who are around that they should leave 

546
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:13,960
him alone because he's been marked by 
God as to be left alone.

547
00:31:13,961 --> 00:31:14,794
And the reason for that I think,
and this is something that's reflected 

548
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:17,944
on our legal system,
is that murder promotes revenge and 

549
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,800
revenge,
destroy societies,

550
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,083
and so God puts an end to the situation 
right there and then by telling people 

551
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:32,611
that despite the fact that cane has,
has committed a terrible crime,

552
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,433
that there will be no retribution.
Cannon goes off and gets married and he 

553
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:44,980
has a number of generations of 
offspring.

554
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,760
If you insult a member of the first 
generation of keynes offspring,

555
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,580
he doesn't kill you.
It killed seven of you.

556
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,990
And if you insult a member of the second
generation of Keynes offspring,

557
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,930
he doesn't kill seven of you,
he killed seven times,

558
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:02,764
seven of you,
and then on down the rate down the road 

559
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,700
of the offspring of Cain is tubilcain.
Tubilcain is the artificer of weapons of

560
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:19,441
war.
And this stunningly brilliant story says

561
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:20,494
in it's incredibly compressed fashion,
that the motivation that drives the 

562
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:29,620
commission of the worst human atrocities
isn't inevitable.

563
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:30,454
Social consequence of the refusal of the
self conscious individual to make the 

564
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:35,764
sacrifices appropriate to establishing a
harmonious life and there consequent 

565
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,773
degeneration into a kind of murderous 
and resentment filled raged rage 

566
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,793
propagating endlessly through its 
variations in society until everything 

567
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:55,400
comes to an end.
And the next story is the flood.

568
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,430
And it's not surprising because if 
things go from bad to worse,

569
00:33:01,431 --> 00:33:04,190
long enough,
everything falls.

570
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,670
And it's a terrifying story.
And I didn't understand that story.

571
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:09,320
I didn't understand that story for 
years.

572
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,340
It wasn't really until I read Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn that,

573
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,120
that,
that I develop,

574
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,870
I think the cognitive capacity to even 
understand what the story meant.

575
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:21,440
Because Solzhenitsyn said in his Nobel 
Prize accepting speech,

576
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,800
a single person who stopped lying can 
bring down a tyranny,

577
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,113
which is a stunning thing to say,
but I would also say something that's 

578
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:31,000
been amply demonstrated in the 20th 
century because we have the.

579
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,160
We have historical examples of people 
who did precisely that.

580
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,970
Got Them.
He did it in fact,

581
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,090
well,
how well did it Nelson Mandela did it,

582
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,223
Solzhenitsyn's gulag.
Archipelago was definitely one of the 

583
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:42,704
acs blows that brought down the Soviet 
Union a stunning achievement for a 

584
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:46,514
person who started writing that book by 
memorizing it when he was a 

585
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,950
concentration camp victim this far away 
from starvation.

586
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,280
It shows you as clearly as anything 
possibly can,

587
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,323
how powerful the human spirit can be if 
it's willing to take on the obligation 

588
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:04,280
of its relationship with the divine and 
also how terrible things can become.

589
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,130
If the responsibility of that burden is 
not children.

590
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,570
Now it's no wonder as far as I can tell 
that people don't think this way because

591
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,093
thinking this way is,
it's catastrophic in a way because the 

592
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:16,364
burden it places on the individual is so
extreme that it's almost unbearable 

593
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:19,630
while in,
uh,

594
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,463
but,
but that's exactly why it is in genesis 

595
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,020
to begin with it.
Adam hides.

596
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,080
He becomes conscious of his own 
vulnerability.

597
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,090
It's like he thinks,
well,

598
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:30,590
a creature such as I could never bear 
such a burden.

599
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:31,424
Well,
there's a lot more to people than meets 

600
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:33,464
the eye.
And the only way I learned that was by 

601
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:35,954
looking at people's and my own peoples 
in my own capacity for evil because I 

602
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:39,764
started to realize that we regard 
ourselves as narrow little beings in a 

603
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:44,090
particular kind of box.

604
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,120
And there's real comfort in that older.
There's tremendous limitation.

605
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,940
You cannot see your way out of that box 
until,

606
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:50,774
you know what I teach my students.
I teach them about Nazi Germany and I 

607
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:57,950
try to make them understand that there's
an overwhelming probability if they were

608
00:34:57,951 --> 00:35:01,040
in Nazi Germany in the 19 thirties,
that they would've been perpetrators and

609
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:01,874
Nazis and overwhelming probability.
And if they can't accept that because 

610
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:06,044
it's a historical fact,
they have absolutely no idea who they 

611
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:08,894
are now,
imagining yourself as a Nazi 

612
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:13,820
perpetrators an unbearably terrifying 
thing to do,

613
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,923
but I don't believe that you can do it.
I don't think that you have any insight 

614
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:18,344
whatsoever into your capacity for good 
until you have some well-developed 

615
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,933
insight into your capacity for evil 
because people can tell you until 

616
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,800
they're blue in the face about your 
capacity for good.

617
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:28,910
It just sounds like a.

618
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,493
It sounds like wishful thinking.
It sounds like this sort of thing that 

619
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:32,924
an advertiser might tell you on TV.
It's just too good to be true and I 

620
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:40,440
don't think believe it,
but I think that if you tell people that

621
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:43,350
you know in a cold,
dark corners of their mind,

622
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:46,020
there are motivations that are so 
terrible that they would.

623
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,093
They would traumatize themselves if they
were ever revealed that everyone knows 

624
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,520
at some level of analysis that that's 
absolutely true.

625
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,380
You think there's evidence throughout 
history that it's possible for people to

626
00:35:58,381 --> 00:35:59,214
be enlightened and you would think since
enlightenment is viewed as the 

627
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:05,364
medication for vulnerability in death,
that everybody would be struggling as 

628
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:09,414
hard as they possibly could to be 
enlightened if such a state exactly and 

629
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:13,464
precisely exists,
but if the barrier to enlightenment is 

630
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:19,880
the development of self consciousness,
of the individual humans,

631
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,143
infinite capacity for evil,
then you can be immediately convinced 

632
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,770
about why enlightenment is in such short
supply.

633
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:30,803
When I

634
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,273
finished my first provisional 
examination of the sorts of motivations 

635
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:36,694
that drove people to set up 
concentration camps and to torture 

636
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:44,110
people terribly and those camps,
I came to a terrible conclusion,

637
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,233
a conclusion that I think in some ways 
was the worst thing that had ever 

638
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:50,890
happened to me,
maybe intellectually and morally.

639
00:36:50,891 --> 00:36:51,724
I thought I came to understand why it is
that people depended on their group 

640
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:56,464
identity and their cultural 
identification because that helped 

641
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:00,790
protect themselves from their own 
vulnerability.

642
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,640
You have to believe things because you 
just don't know everything,

643
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,980
so you have to believe things.
They fill in the gaps to bleach,

644
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,980
fill in the gaps.
If the beliefs are stripped from you,

645
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,873
then your defenses against the infinite 
are stripped and it's no wonder that 

646
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:16,730
people will defend their beliefs.
I thought,

647
00:37:16,731 --> 00:37:19,310
well you do.
If you're too involved in defending your

648
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:21,200
beliefs,
you're going to be willing to kill other

649
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:24,380
people in their defense and we're so 
technologically powerful now that we can

650
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:27,830
no longer be willing to kill other 
people in the defense of our own beliefs

651
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:32,570
because the time for that is passed and 
I realized,

652
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:34,430
well,
if you don't stand up for your beliefs,

653
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:37,640
you leave yourself open to the 
depredations of the infinite.

654
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:41,420
That's equally intolerable.
It seems to leave no way out.

655
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,370
There is a way out.
You know,

656
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:49,360
and I think it's the way out that 
genuinely religious people have tried to

657
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:50,194
offer humanity for thousands and 
thousands of years and the way out of 

658
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:59,070
the conundrum posed to you by your 
reliance on ideological beliefs and your

659
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:04,540
vulnerability in the face of the unknown
is the development of a truly integrated

660
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:08,710
and powerful character.
And that's a individual development.

661
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:13,510
And it means constant confrontation with
things you don't understand and constant

662
00:38:13,511 --> 00:38:18,511
attempts to ensure that your character 
is composed of truth and solidity rather

663
00:38:18,821 --> 00:38:23,350
than deceit and to make of yourself 
something that's built on a rock and not

664
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:25,150
predicated on sand.
And the thing is,

665
00:38:25,151 --> 00:38:25,984
it's one thing to tell people that 
because maybe they should take care of 

666
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:29,554
themselves,
but I don't know if that's enough to 

667
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:34,030
tell people because they don't take care
of themselves that well.

668
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:35,960
But it's a completely other thing to 
say,

669
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:36,794
look,
you know,

670
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,410
every time you make a pathological moral
decision,

671
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:43,310
you move the one world one step closer 
to complete annihilation.

672
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,533
And I absolutely believe that.
I think the historical evidence is 

673
00:38:47,841 --> 00:38:48,674
crystal clear.
And I also think that every time you 

674
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:51,854
make an appropriate moral decision and 
you manifest moral courage in the face 

675
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:57,800
of your own vulnerability,
then you move the world one step farther

676
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:58,634
from the break.
And every that's the case for every 

677
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:02,730
single person.
You know,

678
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,583
Solzhenitsyn said,
drawing on his eastern Orthodox 

679
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,500
Christian background.
Every single person is the center of the

680
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:13,190
world as center of the world,
not the center of the world.

681
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,550
The world's a complicated place.
It can have all sorts of centers.

682
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,710
It's hard to believe that you might be 
one of them,

683
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:22,310
but everything about human existence is 
hard to believe.

684
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,950
The fact that it's here at all,
it's hard to believe the nature of.

685
00:39:24,951 --> 00:39:27,920
It's hard to believe everything that 
human beings does.

686
00:39:27,921 --> 00:39:28,754
It's so ridiculous and remarkable that 
it's like it's a consistently and 

687
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:33,224
constantly unfolding miracle.
The idea that each of you might be a 

688
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:36,824
center of the cosmos in that infinite 
admixture of ridiculousness and now 

689
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:46,850
absurdities is hardly more than one more
ridiculous thing to swallow.

690
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,230
Well,
I'll summarize,

691
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:53,350
I guess said that tragedy is a 
precondition for being.

692
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,570
Being is the interplay between the 
finite and the infinite,

693
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:00,060
and in that interplay,
there's tragedy.

694
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,780
There's no way out of that evil 
something different evils.

695
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:05,614
The conscious attempt to make the 
conditions of existence more 

696
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:11,800
pathological than they have to be and 
it's motivated by conscious intent.

697
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,563
The motivations arise because people pay
a terrible price for their self 

698
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:17,814
conscious awareness and that awareness 
is there awareness of their 

699
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:23,110
vulnerability and that is a terrible 
thing to be aware of.

700
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,010
That vulnerability can be confronted,
forthrightly accepted,

701
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,230
and the appropriate decisions made.
Alternatively,

702
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,064
people can retreat into their own 
rationalistic arrogance and attempt to 

703
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,763
deceive themselves and everyone else 
about the nature of their own existence 

704
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:43,334
and about the nature of reality.
That pathway leads to nothing but 

705
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:46,754
destruction.

706
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,763
I think that there's good reason to 
assume that it's too late in the day in 

707
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:54,574
our developmental course as a species 
for that path to be acceptable anymore 

708
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,420
because we're too powerful and if too 
many people stay on that path,

709
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,433
we're going to do ourselves in.
And so I would say as we've become more 

710
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:07,174
technologically powerful and increasing 
moral burden is being placed on each of 

711
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:13,090
us.
It matters to the,

712
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,480
to the,
to the destiny of the cosmos.

713
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:18,700
Whether or not you get your moral act 
straight,

714
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:19,623
and I don't mean that in a trivial way.
I believe that that's as close to an 

715
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:24,880
empirical fact is anything that can be 
demonstrated,

716
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:25,714
and I also believe that's as terrifying 
a thing to consider as anything you 

717
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:30,880
could possibly imagine and maybe it's 
too much to ask of people,

718
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,433
but you know,
our great religious traditions do 

719
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,710
continually remind us that insight,
every human being,

720
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:37,544
there's a spark of divinity and that 
idea is a precondition for our entire 

721
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:46,440
system of law.
There's always the possibility that it's

722
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:49,830
true and if it's true,
it means that there is a.

723
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,723
there's a,
there's an infant and avenue of 

724
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:57,771
potential that lays open to every single
person and that the ability to transform

725
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:03,240
the terrible conditions of reality into 
something not only acceptable but worthy

726
00:42:03,241 --> 00:42:04,074
of celebration actually lies within our 
grasp and the alternative that the 

727
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:09,264
alternative to that is the continual 
generation of a kind of held that so 

728
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,460
incomprehensibly awful that by any 
reasonable person's standards,

729
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,880
it has to be regarded as something to 
avoid.

730
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,180
That's all I have to say about that.

731
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:35,060
Thank you.
