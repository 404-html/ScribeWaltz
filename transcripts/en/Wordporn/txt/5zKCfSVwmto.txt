Speaker 1:          00:04          What do you see? I think we all work too much. I think we've been, we've been brainwashed into being that we have to spend all our lives working. We never used to do that now before the industrial revolution. I mean, one would sort of, you know, the Irish for instance, they would plant the potatoes in the, uh, I suppose it would be the sort of winter in the, in the ocean. They plant their seed potatoes and then they would sit and they would drink and they would sing and they would eat and they would wait for the potatoes to come up. And then, you know, that was their life. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with it in, in Spain, uh, going to sleep for three hours in the afternoon. It's wonderful. It's so civilized. But we are, you see, the problem is we're, we're, we're told that we're put on this planet to work and we work from 8:00 in the morning till 5:00 at night or whatever. And, and if we're lucky we have a Saturday off and Sunday off and then we can go and buy things. But I don't think that's how life should be for all bankrupt. We all owe billions of dollars and billions of whatevers to somebody. I'm not sure who it is we owe it to. But then somebody out there who's a who must be really pissed off.
