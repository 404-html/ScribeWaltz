Speaker 1:          00:04          Ideas where nothing with that an idea. So I say that a desire for an idea is like a bait on a hook and you're desiring an idea and you have to have patients just like you do in fishing. How deep that hook goes depends on the size of that ball of consciousness and designer. Another word for it is like focus, just focus on some and it's a little bit like daydreaming spots come and Fox common stocks come and meet me. Boom. An idea of condoms that is so thrilling. You've caught a little purple fish with red fins and and little little dancing, speckled eyes and this little fish could be just a fragment, but you love this fragment. You love this fish and that idea, you write it down so you won't forget it. Then now that you have that fish even more powerful bait and soon others will swim in and join to it and the thing will start emerging and it goes like that for me anyway, fragments, but it's all ideas coming, ideas that I've fallen in love with and I'm an a fallen in love with different ideas.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Then you will, but there's billions, trillions of ideas coming, ideas for everything. So that's how it, that's how it goes. Then you get the ideas organized and then you translate those ideas and along the way you stay open because the thing isn't finished til it's finished. There can be happy accidents. You say, how did I get so lucky to get this thing? I thought this was complete, but this is beyond the beyond fitting in here and jumping it. Stay on your toes and don't walk away from any element until it feels correct because it's built out of many, many, many elements. Stay true to the idea all along the road, and then you have some hope of the whole working.
