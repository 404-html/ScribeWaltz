Speaker 1:          00:05          You happy with what you got because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions they get. The politicians, the politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners, they own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses and city halls. They got the back pockets and they own all the big media company, so they control just about all of the news and information. You get to here. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying to get what they want.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. Then I didn't, she didn't that that doesn't help them. That's against their interest, what they want. They want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with lower pay, the longer hours to reduce benefits to the end of overtime and the vanishing pension. That disappears the minute you go to collect it and now they're coming for your social security money. They want you to fucking retirement money. They wanted back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street and you know something. They'll get it. They'll get it all from you sooner or later because they own this fucking place. It's a big club and you ain't in it. You and I are not in the big club by the way. It's the same big club they used to beat you over the head with all day long. When they tell you what to believe all day long, beaten over the head and their media telling you what to believe, what they think and what to buy.

Speaker 1:          02:07          The table is tilted, folks, the game is rigged.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good, honest, hard working. People continue to elect these rich cock suckers who don't give a fuck about them. It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it. Things are nothing more than ordinary jungle beast savages. No different from a cro. Magnon people live 25,000 years ago on the place to seem forest seat and grubs off a rotten logs, no different. Our DNA hasn't changed substantially in 100,000 years. We're still operating out of the lower brain. The reptilian brain fight or flight, kill or be killed. Now we like to think we've evolved in advance because we can build a computer flying airplane, travel underwater. We can write a sonnet painter painting, composed an opera, but you know something. We're out of the jungle on this planet, barely out of the fucking jungle. What we are is semis, civilized beast with baseball caps and automatic weapons.

Speaker 1:          03:08          It just seems to me, seems to me that only a really low Iq population could have taken this beautiful continent, this magnificent American landscape that we inherited. Well, actually we stole it from the Mexicans and the Indians, but hey, it was nice. One we stolen. Only a nation of unenlightened halfwits could could've taken this beautiful place and turned it into what it is today. A shopping mall I'll after mile of ball after ball. Many, many malls, major malls in mini malls. They put the mini malls in between their major malls and then between the many walls they put them in the marts and then between the mini marts you got the car, lots, gas stations, muffler shops, laundromats, cheap hotels, fast food joint strip clubs, and dirty bookstores. America, the beautiful one, big transcontinental commercial cesspool. And how did the people feel about all this? How do people feel about living in a coast to coast shopping mall? Well, they think it's just fucking Dan.

Speaker 2:          04:05          Dave,

Speaker 1:          04:07          they think it is cool as can be because Americans love the mall. They love the wall. That's where they get to satisfy their two most prominent addictions. At the same time, shopping and eating. We got to be the most interesting critters on the planet, and then we wonder why Ufo doesn't just land and say hello.
