Speaker 1:          00:04          From this distance vantage point might, let's see him have any particular interest, but for us it's different. Consider again that dot that's here. That's home. That's us on it. Everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was lived out their lives, the aggregate or joy and suffering. Thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines. Every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every Creator and destroyer of civilization, every Kenyan peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer. Every teacher of morals, corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on the dust suspended in a sunbeam. The earth is a very small stage in a fast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glorious triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent their misunderstanding, how eager they are to kill one another. How fervent their hatreds, our posturings, our imagined self importance. The delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe are challenged by this point of Pale light. Our planet. He's a luminary Spec in the great enveloping cosmic dark, you know, are obscurity in all this vastness. There is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. The earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes, settle. Not yet like it or not. For the moment, the earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits. Then this distance image of our tiny world, to me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot. The only home we've ever known him.
