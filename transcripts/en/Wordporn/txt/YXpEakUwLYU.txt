Speaker 1:          00:04          Somehow part of the package of being a living thinking being is that you get a universe inside of you. You know, you get a galaxy sized object inside you that you can access. And there there are the mountains, the rivers, the jungles, the dynastic families, the ruins, the planets, the work sofar, the poetry, the sciences, the magics of millions upon millions upon millions of worlds. And this is apparently who we each are. We're a little bit of eternity sticking into three dimensional space and for some reason occupying time in a monkey Bondi. But when you turn your eyes then inward, you discover the birthright, the, the existential tax out of which this particular existence emerged. And it's a great secret, a great secret, and the great comfort because it means, you know, mystery didn't die with the fall of our third or the fall of Atlantis or the fall of anything.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Mystery is alive in the moment, in the here and now. It just simply lies on the other side of the barrier of courage. And it isn't even that high of a barrier. It just is a barrier high enough to keep out the insincere and the misdirected. But for those who will claim it in the midst of the historic, okay, awesome. The late 20th century, they become the archaic pioneers. They become the first people to carry the aura borek serpent around to its own tail and to make a closure to the degree that any one of us has this, uh, this connection back to the archaic in our life, it makes where we have been make a lot more sense and it makes where we're going seem a lot more inviting, which it really is.

Speaker 2:          02:29          Yes.
