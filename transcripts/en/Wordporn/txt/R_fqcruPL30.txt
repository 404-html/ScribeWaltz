Speaker 1:          00:04          There I was and I met a beautiful woman, the mother of Nigeria to come. I lived left for 15 years and we are to have children. Their eyes there. Those windows to the soul actually was a lie. He was so alive and so sensitive. She became touched by, I don't know, I want to stress because depression came in. She became psychotic, different personalities, such a beautiful woman. So the mother of my kids, my love. Fifteen years, she jumped from my eighth story.

Speaker 1:          01:03          I didn't see it coming, but I saw the declining line of life getting out of her control that a lot alone with four kids. This is life beyond this. I was hoping and couldn't do anything, but I always had this deep, strange feeling. Something more and I don't know what it is and it's not in words. It's a feeling. It's a grieving from the inside, from the soul, from survival, but it got into me like a flash and I had to go on the spot to show the world that we don't need to be powerless in the face of death, in the face of darkness, depression, trauma, Ptsd. Bipolar, schizophrenia, it wasn't that I was looking for it, I just wanted to answers of life like it is a birthright to know why you're here, why you're here as a father of two to bring purpose sense. That is the simple and it is being torpedoed that bill bought by all kinds of things and confusing sets in. No, this was too much. This was the emotional tone in my heart to be healed. Not only to become aware of how to do that and to take away the documents for those to come. That was my journey, so how to begin. The only thing I had was my instinct, my intuition. It's the way it's taught it.

Speaker 1:          03:01          What do you do? You do 26 rackets in ice. Cold water is the most dangerous. You'll go climb mount everest in his shorts. That would kill most people. Use Swim under the ice. I lose the way and you don't know where you are and and it's frozen and you don't know or you go, you survive. I was able to stay for five to seven minutes every time onto the ice and the only thing I ever ate away at the bedside, which we have lost silence is powerful silence. It's dense. It's what I find.

Speaker 1:          04:01          I just wanted to feel good. I just wanted to feel connected. I showed him, but still the cynicism and the market, not only with the scientists know world, this mockery, if it happens 30 years, 35 years, like decades. That really gets into you, but I just feel good so I just follow my feeling. Twenty six world records later, hey, would I can do anybody can do. It's not about becoming superman or superwoman or like these archetypes. It's becoming you yourself and superior to what we have learned. They did an experiment on me with the Vegas nerve and to see if I was able to compare to all those who weren't and yes, I showed complete control over the vegas nerve which is dealing with all the organs. I don't want to make you nervous system and it was, and that means you have influenced their right.

Speaker 1:          05:09          You have influence on inflammation. Inflammation is the cause of any disease, but he's the iceman we can do with it. Yeah. He is an exception that confirms the rule and I said, no, no, no, no, no, no. What I can do you can do to that a. finally they said, okay, let's do a comparative study. How much time do we need to teach people to get a little bit to the results you have produced in a laboratory setting? It took me four days to bring people both in freezing temperatures without form experience on wantons cope town. Four days later, we had endotoxemia, everybody doing it and 100 percent score within a quarter of an hour. They could suppress it and compare to 16,000 others. They had to compete to prove outcomes. That changed the medical books that year. Tournament's nervous system. The innate immune system into Korean system can be deeply influenced at will.

Speaker 1:          06:10          We have shown that because it was my wife and I was hopeless then I couldn't deal with psychosis and depression or no. Now I am so far that nature has provided me with all the insights and Ansys and I brought it to brain scans, how to tackle bipolar depression, how to take over the power of the brain inside the brain to deal with that what causes bipolar, depression, inflammation in the in the brain because nature has the answers and what they think. Cancer and depression and all those things only with pills and chemos, man, man, man, man, cancer patients, a million a year. You don't want to lose those clients seek well, we live off people being sick. That makes a healthy economy. We are able to change this second world ruled by people who think they can make money out of pills and medicines and think that is the condition of the human race and we have no other way.

Speaker 1:          07:23          The real terrorists is making us believe that we are not able to control our inner physiology. You know the pharmaceuticals in any other industry, how much they use in, in money for advertising, for brainwashing. Our minds making us believe that dependency in doctors, healthcare pills and medicines and therapies, that is the way to go with hell and not look within ourselves. The are the industries will rule over our moorings and show by data what it is to go in to the deepest of our physiology, at-will that makes us able to get rid of medicines and pills and changed our capacity of what we think is possible in healthcare, both mentally and physical. We take out the villain. We take out a real terrorist which is killing right now, millions of people every year and that war we make visible and that adding, we are going to take data and bringing back the belief that we are the masters of our own mind.
