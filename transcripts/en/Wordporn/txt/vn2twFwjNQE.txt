Speaker 1:          00:04          I think the decision making is a part of the issue of assertiveness is always thinking about assertiveness, a home serving as he can be with other people, but you have to be assertive with yourself and make personal decisions. I know of a woman who takes somebody else to go shopping with him because she can't make a decision as to buy the pink or the blue. Right. Back in my office, I used to have a poster that showed a dog standing between two fire hydrants and the caption was decisions, decisions and sometimes the decisions that we are indecisive about hour of no greater consequences than what I remember in the Shul. There was a whole argument at a meeting from the the short organization about an affair that they were going to have, whether they shouldn't have the keyhole with sugar or they can't hold without sugar. I mean these, they said, but there are decisions on life that are much greater than that.

Speaker 1:          01:06          I mean, you make the decision as to who you're going to marry a decision, what kind of professional you want, what kind of job you want to. A. As a doctor, I have to make a decision, I'm going to treat the patient right sometimes their decision, um, do, do we take a chance on surgery? What are the risks of surgery? So there's all levels of decision making first and we have to realize is we are not always going to make the correct decision, right? Only God can be right 100 percent of the time I'm going to make wrong decisions, but my decision making has to be a with integrity, right? If I go to think about whether I should operate on a patient or not, it's not because how much I can collect for the operation, but what is the best thing for this patient?

Speaker 1:          01:57          So, uh, first of all, we have to realize that we are, uh, uh, housed within a physical body that has desires and it has impulses, etc. And that they may color our decision making, right? We may not realize that sometimes we were bribed, right? And the bribe is because we want things to turn out a certain way and we don't make the decision. Um, whAt is really right? Because we see what is going to be right, what we want to be, right. So, uh, there was a, one of the great facility rivers who was asked by one of his followers, how can I make good decisions? So the rep, he said, did you ever watch the type walker? He says, the way a tightrope walker keeps his balance is that he feels himself pulled over to the one side, he overcorrect spot leading to the other side.

Speaker 1:          02:56          And that's how he keeps his balance. He says, when you have a desire to do something, the first thing you ought to recognize is most of the desires come from an animalistic traits. So the first thing you should do is think as to why he should not do it right? And then he leaned over to that side venue may make a decision. Uh, I think that we have to have self confidence in our decisions and realize I am capable of making decisions. There are times when I have to ask expertise that expert advice, but given that ultimately the decisions are mine. And I also have to realize that not making a decision is a decision, but I've decided not to make a decision and I have to realize that if I'm not going to make decisions, people, other people aren't going to make them for me, right?

Speaker 1:          03:45          And the stations that other people are going to make for me, I much, much Worse than this. And then the worst decision that I can make for myself because, uh, I have my, my own interest that night. Really, most people know what's good for them. So, uh, I think that making decisions means getting the best possible information, right? And having self confidence. I think it's appropriate to pray for decisions, right? And that's for divine guidance and help me make the right decision. And then not to be shaken by the fact that after we do the best we can, that the decision may not work out the way we want. Right? And not to see that a, a decision that has poor consequences, not disease. That as a horrible failure on our part. I always say our decisions are good or bad. Determined by how we made them. Not what the consequences were.
