Speaker 1:          00:15          So much better than your performing under pressure, whether it's me or anybody else is the same. You know, I have the same pressures as anyone else. There's time, there's performance, there's financial. I mean, you know, there's deadlines. My pressures are not unique. Everybody has the same kinds of pressures. Um, but what I found, what I find fascinating is the interpretation of the stimuli. Let me explain. So I was watching the Olympics this last summer leopards, and I was amazed at how bad the questions were that the reporters would ask all the athletes, and almost always they asked the same question whether they were about to compete or after they competed. Where are you nervous? Right? And to a t, all the athletes went no. Right? And what I realized is it's not that they're not nervous, it's their interpretation of what's happening in their bodies. I mean, what is, what happens when you're nervous, right?

Speaker 1:          01:09          Your heart rate starts to go, you're, you know, you sort of get a little tense. You get a little sweaty, right? You have the expectation of what's coming. And we interpreted that as I'm nervous now. What's the interpretation of excited? Your heart rate starts to go. You become, you're anticipating what's coming, right? You get a little sort of like tense. It's all the same thing. It's the same stimuli except these athletes, these, these Olympic quality athletes have learned to interpret the stimuli that the rest of us would say as nervous, as excited. They all said the same thing. No, I'm not nervous. I'm excited. And so I've actually practiced it just to tell myself when I start to get nervous that this is excitement, you know? And so we're, when you, I used to speak in front of a large audience and somebody would say, how do you feel? He's saying little nervous. Now when somebody says, how do you feel? I'm like, really excited actually. And it, it came from just sort of telling myself, no, no, no, this is excitement and it becomes a little bit automatic later on. Um, but it's kind of a remarkable thing to deal with pressure by interpreting what your body is experiencing as excitement rather than nerves. And it's really kind of effective. It makes you want them to rush forward rather than pull back and yet it's the same experience.
