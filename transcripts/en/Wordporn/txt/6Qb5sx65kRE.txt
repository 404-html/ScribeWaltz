Speaker 1:          00:05          What makes you itch? What sort of a situation would you like? That's suppose I do this often in vocational guidance of students. They come to me and say, well, we're getting out of college and we haven't the faintest idea what we want to do. So I always ask the question, what would you like to do if money were no object, how would you really enjoy spending your life?

Speaker 1:          00:39          Wow. It's so amazing. As a result of our kind of educational system, crowds of students say, well, we'd like to be painters. We'd like to be poets, we'd like to be writers. But as everybody knows, you counted on any money that way or not passage. This is what I'd like to live an outdoors life and ride a horses. I said he wanted to teach in the riding school. Uh, let's go through with it. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him, you do that and uh, forget the money. Uh, because if you say that getting the money is the most important, you will spend your life completely wasting your time. You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living. That is to go on doing things you don't like doing, which is stupid. Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing. Then a long life in a miserable way.

Speaker 1:          01:42          And after all, if you do really like what you're doing, it doesn't matter what what it is, you can't, eventually they turn it. You could eventually become a master of it is the only way to become a master of something that we really with it. And then you'll be able to get a good fee for whatever it is. So don't, don't worry too much that that's the, everybody's somebody is interested in everything and anything you can be interested in, you will find out as well. But it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like in order to go on spending things you don't like doing things you got like, and to teach her children following the same track. What we're doing is we're bringing up children in educating to live the same sort of lives we are living in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing. So it all rich and no vomit. It never gets there. And so therefore it's so important instead of this question, what do I desire? Well, when my answer that question in a naive way, we figured out the vaunted desire. Uh, what we want is to control everything

Speaker 1:          03:02          to create girls that don't grow old apples that don't rot, close, that never wear out conveyances that get from one place to another instance list. So we don't have to wait power available to do anything that you could conceive and do it just instantly like that to get this funny technological omnipotence. But if you take time out to think about that and really go into it with your full strength of imagination and find out whether that's where you want it,

Speaker 2:          03:38          b,

Speaker 1:          03:41          you will soon see that's not what you want because the moment you have a situation where you are really in control of things, that is to say in which the future is almost completely predictable. You will see us. As I said last night, that aid completely predictable. Future is already in the past you've had it. That's not what you want. You want a surprise. You don't know what that's going to be because obviously it wouldn't be a surprise in the food here. What a pleasant surprise. I'd like you to say what sort of a surprise would be pleasant and you can't really answer that because you know if there were to be such things as pleasant surprises, that must also be unpleasant. Surprises must be rude shops. So you are like somebody's taking a one of those wishing well boxes, tubs, you know where you're fishing and you bring out a package and you don't know whether you've got a dead rat in it or a new camera. That's the way that's, that seems to be the thing that really excites people. But quite set. And there that comes out of this inquiry, a feeling of

Speaker 1:          05:11          real disillusionment with the ideal of power.

Speaker 2:          05:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:16          To be in power, to be in control is not something that any sense suitable person wants. You imagine the situation of big brother Mr j Edgar Hoover, Heinrich Himmler to be glued day at night to a highly descended office, telephone, television screens, watching peaky spine, everyone in anything. Getting all this information together. Why you could never leave the office. I mean that people characterize cause like they had go hoover's goes home in the evening and uh, but when he's back home, you know, there are gods sitting outside the door. Does that hotline telephones going to something? He's always having to be in control. And so when you think things through like that, you understand that do not want, don't want to control it. And therefore these Zen Buddhist masters that I met and others were not super oncologists and very many westerners who visited Japan expecting to get a Satori as a result of which they would know everything and control everything, but grievously disappointed and said, there's not much in the south.
