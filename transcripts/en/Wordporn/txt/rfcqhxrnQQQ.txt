Speaker 1:          00:04          You take a drink with your friends and somebody says, yeah, we should go skydiving tomorrow, and you go, yeah, we'll go skydiving, or yes, so then that night you're laying in your bed and you just keep. You're terrified. You keep imagining over and over again jumping out of an airplane and you can't figure out why you would do that and you laying there and you have the worst night's sleep of your life. You wake up the next day and you go down and you said where you were going to meet and everybody's there, so you get in a van and you don't know that your friends had the same night that you had because they're pretended like they didn't. They were like, yeah man, my uncle is a navy seal and you know this is going to be great. I'm looking forward to this. And you're like, oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Oh my God, and your stomach is terrible. You can't eat and everything, but you don't want to be the only one who doesn't jump out of this airplane. So you get there and then you have the safety brief and you're standing there. And the guys will tell you what the chute doesn't open. What's going to happen is you're doing, you want help with. So you fly and you go up, you go up, you go up and you go up to 14,000 feet and you notice there's a. A light is red and it's yellow and green, right? So right now the light's red. So then you start thinking, at some point the light's going to go green. If you don't know what's going to happen, right? And you wait and negotiate yellow and the light goes green and somebody opens the door. And in that moment you realize you've never been in a freaking airplane with the door open.

Speaker 1:          01:34          And you go and the guy walks you up to the end of the thing and you're standing and your toes are on the edge and you're looking out down to death. And they say, Oh, I'm three. And they say one, two. And he pushes you on to. Because people grab on three and you go and you fall out of the airplane. And in one second you realize that it's the most blissful experience of your life. Your flying right, it doesn't feel like falling, right? It's like you actually are kind of held a little bit by the wind and then you start and you start falling. You're falling and you. There's zero fear. You realize that the point of maximum danger is the point of minimum fear. It's bless, bless, and you're flying and you're doing that and then 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 40 seconds, and you have enough time to just kind of like, oh shit. That's that building. I, I like that.

Speaker 1:          02:49          And the lesson for me was, why were you scared in your bed the night before? Why did you. What do you need that fear for bundling you scared in your bed. Sixteen hours before you jump. Why are you scared in the car? Why could you not enjoy breakfast with what? What? What did you need to fear is fear of what? You're nowhere even near to the airplane. Everything up to the stepping out. There's actually no reason to be scared. It only just ruins your day, your. You don't have to jump, and then in that moment, all of a sudden where you should be terrified is the most blissful experience of your life, and God placed the best things in life on the other side of terror, on the other side of your maximum fear, all of the best things in life.
