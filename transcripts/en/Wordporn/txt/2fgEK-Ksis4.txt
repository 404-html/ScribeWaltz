Speaker 1:          00:05          We don't have to have fast food workers, we don't, we don't have to have people who work shit

Speaker 2:          00:10          jobs, we don't have to, which Si to figure out how to restructure society. So everybody somehow another plays a part has something to contribute, something to share. I mean that's what a real society is supposed to be like. I've given you some coconuts. You get me some fish, you know, we make a deal and you do it back and forth and left and right, and when there's nothing to contribute, then you start looking. The president needs to give us jobs. We need jobs. So instead of something to contribute, you just find something to do with your time and then it becomes about doing that more than it becomes about finding something to contribute. So society gets wrapped around becoming a part of a machine society instead of becoming a bunch of individuals that are expressing themselves in unique ways and everybody's sort of borrows and shares and sells this and you sell that.

Speaker 2:          00:57          And we all sort of figured out how we can contribute in a society. We got sidetracked and diverted into these boxes that they call companies and corporations and we got stuck into these containers. They go cubicles or offices and we've got forced into this system, so our time, instead of it being invested in making pottery or or fixing cars or doing something where you have a passion or you have some sort of a connection to instead of that you've sold your life to sit in a box and work for a machine, an uncaring machine that demands productivity, doesn't understand you. It doesn't want to understand you. It has a bunch of very strict things in order to keep the humor at a minimum in the office, just in case one fuckheads says some stupid sex jokes that gets him sued and they have to give somebody a million dollars.

Speaker 2:          01:46          So get it together and this is your life now. No natural behavior. Everybody's wearing clothes. They don't want to where everybody's showing up and doing something they don't want to do. They have no connection to. That's the problem with our society and then what's the reward for all this stuff? Go on, get a big TV, go home, you're going to get a shiny belt buckle, you're going to get a nice purse. You're going to wear shoes that you couldn't afford last week. You got to get that dream car and every week we're chasing down this new object and every week trying to fill this hole in this, this, this sad shadow of a life that we've been left with after work that you work eight to whatever, the hours a day plus commuting and then you'll like this and that's your life. That's your real fucking life.

Speaker 2:          02:30          All that other stuff is not your life anymore. All that other stuff is work and most of us have committed to that. I know you've been there before and I've been there before and we understand that it's trapped as we got out of it, but for the people that are in it, a lot of times they don't even understand it's a trap. They just think it's a good job. The thing that got dental, I'm doing really good and I got my own parking spot. It's got my name on it. Just a piece of a heartless shitty machine that makes money.
