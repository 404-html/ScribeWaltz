Speaker 1:          00:04          You want to change the world, you start from yourself and work outward because you build your competence that way. So like I don't know how you can go out and protest the structure of the entire economic system if can't keep your room organized. People try to change the outside world for lots of ways, but many of those ways aren't just pure good. And so what I've thought about is that, well what you start to do is you start to tail and act out the truth locally, like within the domain of your actual competence. You know, cause the world presents itself as a series of puzzles, some of which your capable of solving and some of which you're not. And you have many puzzles in front of you that you could solve, but you choose not to. You know that those are the things that weigh on your conscience.

Speaker 1:          00:47          It's like, you know why I should really do this, but you don't. It's like, so I had this idea a long time ago because the world is a pretty dreadful place. I thought, well, what would the world be like if people stopped avoiding the things they knew they should do? You know? Because the question is how much are we contributing to the fact that life is a, is an existential catastrophe and a tragedy? How much is our own corruption contributing to that? That's a really worthwhile question. Things you leave undone because you're angry, you're resentful, you're lazy, you have a neuro Shia, well you consult your conscience and it says, well, you know, that place over there, it could use a little work. It's the same as working on yourself. And so you clean that up because he can and then things are a little clearer around you and you're a little better off because you've practiced a bit and and so your little stronger.

Speaker 1:          01:36          And then something else manifest itself and says, well maybe you could like take a crack at fixing me up too. So he decided to do that and then that gets a little bit more pristine, you know, and soon. And it's humble because you're not exceeding your domain of competence. You know, it's like, don't be fixing up the economy. 18 year old. Can you even clean up your own room? No. Well, you should think about that. You should think about that because if you can't even clean up your own room, who the hell are you to give advice to the world?
