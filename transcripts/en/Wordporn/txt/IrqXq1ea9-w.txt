Speaker 1:          00:07          So very worried. Secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society. And we are as a people inherently and historic opposed to secret society to secret oats and a secret proceedings. But we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on cupboard, means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on severity. And instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. It's mistakes a buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned. No rumor is printed. No secret is revealed. That is why the Athenian lawmaker solon decreed it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy. But I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be free and ended,
