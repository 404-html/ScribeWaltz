Speaker 1:          00:06          Well, now really when we go back then to falling in love and say it's crazy falling. See, we don't say rising into love, isn't it? The idea of the fall and uh, it is, goes back. As a matter of fact, two extremely fundamental things that, that is always a curious it at some point between the fall and the creation. Taking this gosling risk is the condition of that being live you see for all life is an act of faith and an act of gamble. The moment you take a step, you will do so on an act of faith because you don't really know that the flaw is not going to give unto your feet the limits. You take a journey. What an act of faith. The moment you enter into any kind of Hulan undertaking in relationship, what an act of faith. See you've given yourself up. But this is the most powerful thing that can be done. Surrender. See I love is an act of surrender to another person. Total abandonment. I give myself to you, take me through anything you like when you see so that's quite mad because you see it's letting things get out of control. All sensible people keep things in control. Watch it, watch it, watch it. Security vigilance, watching police watch it. God's watching who's going to watch the gods? So actually, therefore the, the, the cost of wisdom. What is really a sensible, uh, is to let go, is to commit oneself, to give oneself up. And that's quite mad. So we come to the strange conclusion that in madness lies sanity.
