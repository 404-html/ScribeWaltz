Speaker 1:          00:04          I have to make notes because a lot of my inspiration comes from meeting people or going outside of the country or going around a corner and tomorrow neighborhood and talking to a five year old little boy.

Speaker 1:          00:17          It's mainly kids, man. I always say this kids bugging me out because they have no fear, nothing. My little niece, she's two years old, but she's fierce, nothing and she has no concept of reality as we know it. That always inspired me to write for some reason, man, it gives me a moment. Talking to them gives me a moment to step back and look at the world for what I know this case is that always tripped me out cause I told them about the story when I seen him when I was eight, nine years old with two on Rosecrans.

Speaker 1:          01:01          We're shooting a video of my neighborhood in Compton when two blocks down and got me. By the time we got me, everybody was out there. It was like pandemonium. He put me on his shoulders and that it was Dr Dre and um, two part, right. Then fast forward 15 years later, I'm in the studio world and I'm telling him that story. I was one of the kids out there as much as he remembers him. Crazy, crazy to me, which just me being an ultimate fan, I'm still a fan to this day, but to actually sit down and have conversations beyond the music, he wasn't just a figment of my imagination. I was watching on TV screen. The people are watch. They just didn't get there on a pure luck. They actually worked hard and they are human beings. We're real emotion, real dry, real consistency, real hunger.

Speaker 1:          01:52          You know, deep down we're all kids at heart and I know I am. I'm the biggest kid, you know, so I can be able to relate and communicate them, communicate with them in a way that I watch. Most adults can't sit there and hold a conversation, you know, and go back to the studio man, or write them most bugged out song, you know, just because it just gave me, like I said, it gives me a chance to sit back and allow myself and look at the perspectives of the different spectrum of having responsibilities and not having any at all. And I have to remember these things. I have to write them down and then five or three months later, I have to find that same emotion that I felt when I was inspired by definite process. It's working process.
