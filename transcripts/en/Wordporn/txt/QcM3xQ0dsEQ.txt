Speaker 1:          00:04          When no one listens to you, we feel that once they see to all sorts of things start to happen, for instance, you have so much pain inside yourself that you try and hurt yourself on the outside because you want help, but it's the wrong help you're asking for. People see it as crying wolf or attention seeking and they think because you're in the media all the time, you've got enough attention, inverted commerce. But I was actually crying out. I wanted to get better in order to go forward and continue my duty and my role as a wife, mother, Princess of Wales. So I, uh, yes, I did influx for myself. I didn't like myself. I was ashamed because I couldn't cope with the pressures. What did you actually do? Well, I just taught my arms my next and I work in environments now where I see women doing similar things and I'm able to understand completely where they're coming from.

Speaker 1:          00:58          I think every strong woman in history has had to walk down a similar path and I think it's the strength that causes the confusion, the fear. Why is she strong? Where does she get it from? Where she lives? She going to use it. I'd like to be a queen of people's hearts and people's hearts and I don't see myself being queen, just country. I don't think many people would want me to be queen. Actually, when I say many people, I mean established time, married into because they've decided to Salta. Why do you think they've decided? Because I do things differently because I didn't go by when we book because neutral, the whole not the head and that's got me into trouble in my work. I understand that and show it.
