Speaker 1:          00:04          People are starving, they may not know it because they're being fed mass produced garbage, the packaging, it's colorful and it's loud, but it's being produced in the same factories that make pop tarts and ipads by people sitting around thinking, what can we do to get people to buy more of these and they're very good at their jobs, but that's what it is you're getting because that's what they're making. They're selling you something and the world is built on this. Now politics and government are built on this. Corporations are built on this.

It's profound importance in my life. Give that to the world rather than selling something to the world. Don't allow yourself to be tricked into thinking that the way things are is the way the world must work and that in the end, selling is what everyone must do. Try not to the world needs you. It doesn't need you at a party. Having read a book about how to appear smart at parties. These books exist and they're attempting, but resist falling into that trap world needs you at the party starting real conversations saying,
