Speaker 1:          00:06          Anger around, privately held with a lot of us go around feeling quite enraged, angry, privately about the way that I love lives have gone. My task today is to turn that into sadness. If we, if we managed to turn rage into grief, we will have made psychological progress and this is the task today is behind rage very often is an unusual quality because we tend to feed the hungry. People are sort of dark and pessimistic characters absolutely not scratch the surface of any regularly angry person and you will find a wild optimist. It is in fact that drives range. I think of the person who screens every time they can't find their housekeeper or every time they get stuck in traffic. These unfortunate characters are evincing, a curious but reckless faith in a world in which keys never go astray. The roads are mysteriously traffic free.

Speaker 1:          01:05          It is hope that is turbocharging rage. So if were to get a little bit less sad, uh, and as a little less angry about our love lives, we will have to diminish. Some of the reason is that all of us will not manage to find the right person, but we will probably all of us manage to find a good enough so and that's success. In short, we don't know very much how to love and it sounds very odd because it actually. Somebody said, you look, all of us probably in this room would probably need to go to a school of law with a school of love. Love is just an instinct. No, it's not. It's a skill and it's a skill that needs to be learned and it's a skill of it. Our society refuses to consider as a skill. We are meant to always just follow our feelings.

Speaker 1:          01:53          If you keep following your feelings, you will almost certainly make a big mistake in your life. What is love? Ultimately? Love, I believe is something. First of all, there's a distinction between loving and being loved. We all start off in life by knowing a lot about being loved. Being loved is the funded. Uh, that's when somebody brings you something on a tray and ask you how your day at school went to federal. And we grow up thinking that that is what's going to happen in an adult relationship. We can be forgiven for that. It's an understandable mistake, but it's a very tragic mistake and it leads us not to pay attention to the other side of the equation which is to love. And what does it really mean to love, to love ultimately is to have the willingness to interpret someone's on the surface, not very appealing behavior in order to find more benevolent reasons why it may be unfolding.

Speaker 1:          02:39          In other words, to love someone is to apply charity and generosity of interpretation. Problem is we live in a romantic culture that privileges impulse and when it comes to love, something tricky occurs because you don't have to be a paid up believer in psychotherapy or psychoanalysis to realize that the way we love as adults sits on top of our early childhood experiences and in early childhood. The way that we learned about love was not just via experiences of tenderness and kindness and generosity. The love that we would have tasted his children will also be bound up with experiences of being let down, being humiliated. Maybe being with a parent who treated us very harshly scolded us or made us feel small in some way. In other words, quite a lot about our early experiences of love, a bound up with various kinds of suffering. Now something quite bad happens when we start to go out into the adult world and start to choose love partners. We think we're out to find partners who will make us happy, but we were out to find partners who will feel familiar and that may be a very different thing.
