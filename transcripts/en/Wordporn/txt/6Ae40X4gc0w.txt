Speaker 1:          00:05          The physical universe is basically it playful. There is no necessity for it whatsoever. It isn't going anywhere. That is to say it doesn't have some destination that it ought to arrive at that it is best understood by analogy with music because music as an art form is essentially playful. We say you play the piano, you don't work the piano. Why music differs from say travel when you travel you are trying to get somewhere in music though one doesn't make the end all the composition. The point if that was so the best conductors would be those who played faster and there would be composers who wrote of lifting people go to concert, just hear one crashing call cause that's the end. Say went dancing. You don't aim at a particular spot in the room. That's where you should arrive. The whole point of the dancing of the doubt, but we don't see that as something brought by our education into our everyday conduct.

Speaker 1:          01:15          We've got a system of schooling but gives a completely different impression. It's all graded and what we do is we put the child into the corridor of this raid system. Well, it kind of come on Kitty, kitty, kitty. Yeah. You go to kindergarten, you know that's a great thing because when you finish that, you'll get into first grade and then come on first grade needs the second grade and so on. And then you'd get out of grade school, you've got high school and it's revving up. The thing is coming. Then you're going to go to college by Jovan. You get into graduate school and when you're through with graduate school, you go out to join the world. Then you'll get into some racket where you're selling insurance and they've got that quota to make and you're going to make that. And all the time the thing is coming, it's coming, it's coming.

Speaker 1:          02:00          That great thing, the success you're working. And then when you wake up one day, about 40 years old, you say, my God, I've arrived. I'm there. And you don't feel very different from what you always felt. Okay. What would the people who live to retire and put those savings away and then when they 65 they don't have any energy left that more or less important. And they go and in an old people's senior citizens community, because we've sinned, did cheated ourselves the whole way down the line did we thought of life by analogy with a journey, with a pilgrimage which had a serious purpose at the end. And the thing was to get to that end success or whatever it is, or maybe Heaven after you're dead, but we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.
