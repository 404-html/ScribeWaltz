Speaker 1:          00:04          Specify your goal. If you do that, you do that in some sense as a unique individual. You want to. You want to specify goals that make you say, Oh, if that could happen as a consequence of my efforts, it would clearly be worthwhile because the question always is, why do something? Because doing nothing is easy. You just sit there and you don't do anything that's real easy. The question is why would you ever do anything and the answer that has to be because you've determined by some means that it's worthwhile and then the next question might be, well, where should you look for worthwhile things and one would be, well, you could consult your own temperament and the other would be while you kinda look at how. Look at what it is that people accrue that's valuable across the lifespan. Look, look what so you do a structural analysis of the sub components of human existence and already did that.

Speaker 1:          00:54          You need a family. You need friends like you don't need to have all of these things, but you better have most of them. Family, friends, career, educational goals, plans for time outside of work, attention to your mental and physical health, etc. You know those are, that's what life is about. And if You don't have any of those things, well then all you've got left is misery and suffering, so that's a bad, that's a bad deal for you. So, so once you, once you set up that, that goal structure, let's say, and that's really in many in many ways, that's what you should be doing at universities is, that's exactly what you should

Speaker 2:          01:30          you're doing is trying to figure out who it is that you're trying to be, right? And you aim at that and then use everything you learn as a means of building that person that you want to be. And, and I really mean want to be. I don't mean should be even those things, those things are going to overlap and it's important to distinguish between those because that's partly, and this is back down to the micro routine analysis. So ashley is saying, well, you're going to try to make yourself more industrious. Okay? Number one, specify your damn goals because how are you going to hit something if you don't know what it is that isn't going to happen, and often people won't specify their goals too because they don't like to specify conditions for failure. So if you keep yourself all vague and foggy, which is real easy because that's just a matter of not doing as well.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Then you don't know when you fail and people might say, well, I really don't want to know when I fail because that's painful, so I'll, I'll keep myself blind about when I fail. ThAt's fine, except you'll fail all the time. Then you just won't know it until you failed so badly that you're done. And that can easily happen by the time you're 40. So. So I would recommend that you don't let that happen. So that's willful blindness, right? You could have known, but you chose not to. Okay? So once you get your goal structure set up, you think, okay, if I could have this life looks like that might be worth living, despite the fact that it's going to be anxiety provoking and threatening and there's gonna be some suffering and loss involved in all of that. Obviously the goal is to to have a vision for your life such that all things considered that justifies your effort. Okay. So then what do you do? Well then then you turn down to the micro routines, just like, okay, well this is what I'm aiming for. How does that instantiates itself day to day, week to week, month to month. And that's where something like a schedule can be unbelievably useful. Google calendar. It's like naked damn schedule and stick to it. Okay. So what's the rule with the schedule? It's not a bloody prison. That's the first thing that peter, I

Speaker 1:          03:25          will do wrong. He said, well I don't like to follow a schedule once, like, well what kind of schedule are you setting up? Well I, I have to do this, then I have to do this, then I have to do this, you know? And then I just go play video games because he wants to do all these things that I have to do. It's like wrong. Set the damn schedule up so that you have the day you want. That's the trick. It's like, okay, I've got tomorrow. If I was going to set it up so it was the best possible day I could have practically speaking, what would it look like? Well then you schedule that and obviously there's a bit of responsibility that's going to go along with that because if you have any sense, one of the things that you're gonna insist upon is that at the end of the day, you're not in worse shape than you were then at the beginning of the day, right?

Speaker 1:          04:09          Because that's a stupid day. If you have a bunch of those in a row, you just dig, dig yourself a hole, and then you bury yourself in. It's like, sorry, that's just not a good strategy. It's a bad strategy. So maybe 20 percent of your day has to be responsibility and obligation, or maybe it's more than that, depending on how far behind you are. But even that you can, you can ask yourself, okay, well I've got these responsibilities, I have to schedule the damn things in. What's the right ratio of responsibility to reward? And you can ask yourself that just like you'd negotiate with someone who is working for you. It's like, okay, you gotta work tomorrow. Okay, so I want you to work tomorrow. And you might say, okay, well what are you going to do for me that makes it likely that I'll work for you while you could ask yourself that, you know, maybe you do an hour of, of responsibility and then you play a video game for 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          04:57          I don't know, whatever turns your crank man. but you know, you have to negotiate with yourself and not tyrannized yourself like you're negotiating with someone that you care for that you would like to be productive and have a good life. And, and that's how you make the schedule. It's like. And then you look at the day and you think, well, if I had that day, that'd be good. Great. You know, and you, you're useless and horrible. So you'll probably only hit it with about 70 percent accuracy, but that beats the hell out of zero, right? And if you hit it even with 50 percent accuracy, another rule is well, aim for 51 percent the next week or 50 and a half percent for god's sake or because you're going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and spiral you upward and so, so that's one way that you can work on your conscientiousness is a plan a life you'd like to have, and you do that partly by referring to social norms. That'S more or less rescuing your father from the belly of the whale, but the other way you do that is by having a little with yourself

Speaker 2:          05:58          about as if you don't really know who you are because you know what you're like. You won't do what you're told. You won't do what you tell yourself to do. You must have noticed that. It's like you're a bad employee and a worse boss and both of those work for you. You don't know what you want to do and then when you tell yourself what to do, you don't do it anyways. You should fire yourself and find someone else to beat. But, but you know, my point is, is that you have to understand that you're not your own servant, so to speak. You're someone that you have to negotiate with and that's. And you're someone that you want to present the opportunity of having a good life too. And that's hard for people because they don't like themselves very much. so you know, they're always like cracking the whip and then procrastinating and cracking the whip and then procrastinating and it's like so boring and such a pathetic way of spending your time. And you know what that's like because he probably wasted like six hours a day and I think

Speaker 1:          06:51          we did an economic calculation about that awhile back. Right? Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an hour, something like that. I mean, you're not getting paid that now, but you're young. and so this is investment time and what you do now is going to multiply its effects in the future. So, so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour, which is perfectly reasonable. So if you waste six hours a day and you are, then you're wasting about $2,000 a week or about $100,000 a year. So like go ahead. But that's what it's costing you every hour and you need to know what your damn time is worth. So let's say it's not 50 bucks, it's 30, whatever. Maybe it's a hundred. It's somewhere in that range. One of the things that you should be asking yourself is when you spend an hour was that, well, what have I paid someone 50 bucks to have had that hour? And if that answer is no, it's like, well maybe you should do something else with your time. and it depends on whether or not you think that your time is worthwhile. But the funny thing about not assuming that is if you assume your time isn't worthwhile, what happens is you don't just sit around sort of randomly in a state of responsibility lists bliss. What you do is you suffer existentially.
