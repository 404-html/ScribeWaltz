Speaker 1:          00:04          I'm worried really about how much fuzzy thinking is going on in the world. Know Fuzzy thinking. Do people just not thinking straight? Consider this following example. Imagine you have a spelling bee. This is contrived, but it makes the point. There's a spelling bee and you have to spell the word cat. Okay, so one student spells it, c, a tea person. Got It right. The next person spells it, k a t. that's wrong. You got that wrong. Okay. Third Person Spells it. X Q, w you realize that is marked equally is wrong with theK , a t,

Speaker 1:          00:58          when you could argue that Kat is a bitter spelling for cat. Then C, a t, dictionaries know this because that's how they spell it phonetically, and so we've built a system for ourselves where there is an answer and everything else is not the answer. Even when some answers are better than others. So our brains are absent the wiring capable of coming up with an original thought. If you're an employer in two candidates come up looking for a job, and this is again a contrived example and, and you're interviewing the two candidates and, and you say, oh, it's part of this interview. I just want to ask you, what's the height of the spire on this building that we're in? Candidate says, oh, I was, I was just, I was a, uh, an architect. I've majored in architecture for awhile and I memorize the heights of all the buildings on campus.

Speaker 1:          01:58          I know the height and inspire is 150 feet. One hundred 55 feet tall. Okay? Turns out that's the right answer. That's the right answer. And a person came up with it in second. That person goes away, the next candidate walks in. Do you know the height of the spire on this building? The candidate says, no, but I'll be right back. Person runs outside measures the length of the shadow of that spire on the ground measures the length of his or her own shadow ratios. The height to the shadows comes up with a number, runs back inside. It's about a 150 feet. Who are you going to hire? I'm hiring the person who figured it out, even though it took that person longer, even though the person's answer is not as precise. I'm hiring that person because that person knows how to use the mind in a way not previously engaged. You realize when you know how to think, it empowers you far beyond those. No. Only what? Two things.
