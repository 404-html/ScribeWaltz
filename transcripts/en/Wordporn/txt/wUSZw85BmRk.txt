Speaker 1:          00:05          So me and Jayda was reflecting about, and I asked her, I said, what did she think was, you know, one of the biggest revelations that she had had about love? She said that you cannot make a person happy. You can make a person smile. You can make a person feel good. You can make a person laugh, but whether or not a person is happy is deeply and totally and utterly out of your control. We came into this false romantic concept that somehow when we got married that we would become one. And what we realized is that we were two completely separate people on two completely separate individual journeys and that we were choosing to walk our separate journey these together, but her happiness was her responsibility and my happiness was my responsibility.

Speaker 2:          01:22          We decided that we were going to find our individual internal private, separate joy. Then we were going to present ourselves to the relationship and to each other already happened.

Speaker 1:          01:41          It's kind of an unrealistic and can be destructive to place the responsibility for your happiness on anybody other than yourself.
