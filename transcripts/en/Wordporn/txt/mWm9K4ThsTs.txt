Speaker 1:          00:05          How many hours a day you waste or how many hours a week do you waste? The classic answer is something like four to six hours a day. You know, inefficient studying, watching things on youtube that not only do you not want to watch that you don't even care about that make you feel horrible about watching after you're done. That's probably four hours right there. No, what you think, well, that's 2025 hours a week. It's $100 a month. That's two and a half full work weeks. It's half a year of work weeks per year. And if your time is worth $20 an hour, which is a radical undressed, but it's probably more like 50 if you think about it in terms of deferred wages, if you're wasting 20 hours a week, you're wasting $50,000 a year and you are doing that right now and it's because you're young. Wasting $50,000 a year is a way bigger catastrophe than it would be for me to waste it because I'm not going to last nearly as long.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And so if your life isn't everything, it could be, you could ask yourself, well, what would happen if you just stopped wasting the opportunities that are in front of you? You'd be who knows how much more efficient, 10 times more efficient, 20 times more efficient. That's the prieto distribution. You have no idea how efficient, efficient people get. It's completely, it's off the charts while and if we all got her act together collectively and stopped making things worse, because that's another thing people do all the time. Not only do they not do what they should to make things better, they actively attempt to make things worse because they're spiteful or resentful or arrogant or deceitful or or homicidal or genocidal or all of those things all bundled together in an absolutely pathological package. If people stopped really, really trying just to make things worse, we have no idea how much better they would get just because of that.

Speaker 1:          01:53          So there's this weird dynamic that's part of the existential system of ideas between human vulnerability, social judgment, both of which are are, are, are major causes of suffering and the failure of individuals to adopt the responsibility that they know they should adopt. And that's the thing that's interesting too is that I know like one of the, another thing I've asked often ask my undergraduate classes is, you know, there's this idea that, that people have that people have a conscience. You know what the conscience is. It's, it's this feeling or voice you have in your head just before you do something that you know is stupid telling you that probably you shouldn't do that stupid thing. You don't have to listen to it strangely enough. But you go ahead and do it anyways and then, Oh of course, exactly what the conscience told you was going to happen inevitably happen so that you'll feel even stupider about it then you would if it happened by accident.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Cause you know, I knew this was going to happen. I got a warning it was going to happen and I went and did it anyways. And the funny thing too is that that conscience operates within people and we really don't understand the hell that is. So you might say, well, what would happen if you abided by your conscience for five years or for 10 years? What sort of position might you be in? What sort of family might you have? What sort of relationship might you be able to forge? And you can be bloody sure that a relationship that's forged on the basis of who you actually are is going to be a lot stronger and more welcome than one that's forged on the basis of who you aren't. Now of course that means that the person you're with has to deal with the full force of you in all your ability and your catastrophe and that's a very, very difficult thing to negotiate.

Speaker 1:          03:34          But if you do negotiate it well at least you have something, you have somewhere solid to stand and you have somewhere to live. You have a real life and it's a great basis upon which to bring children into the world, for example, because you can have an actual relationship with them instead of torturing them half to death, which is what happens in a tremendous, a tremendously large minority of cases. Well, it's more than that too because, and this is what I'll close with, and this is why I wanted to introduce social knutson's writings to you. You see, because it isn't merely that your fate depends on whether or not you get your act together and to what degree you decide that you're going to live out your own genuine being. It isn't only your fate, it's the fate of everyone that you're networked with. And so you know, you think, well, there's 9 billion, 7 billion people in the world are going to peak at about 9 billion by the way, and then it'll decline rapidly, but 7 billion people in the world, and who are you?

Speaker 1:          04:33          You're just one little dust mote among that 7 billion. And so it really doesn't matter what you do or don't do, but that's simply not the case. It's the wrong model because you're at the center of a network, you're a node in a network. Of course, that's even more true now that we have social media. You'll, you'll know a thousand people at least over the course of your life, and they'll know a thousand people each, and that puts you one person away from 1,000,002 persons away from a billion. And so that's how you're connected and the things you do, they're like dropping a stone in a pond. The ripples move outward and the affect things in ways that you can't fully comprehend, and it means that the things that you do and that you don't do are far more important than you think.
