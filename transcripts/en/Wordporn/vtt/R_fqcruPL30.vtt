1
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>There I was and I met a beautiful woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother of Nigeria to come.</v>

2
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I lived left for 15 years and we are to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have children.</v>

3
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Their eyes there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those windows to the soul actually was a</v>

4
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so alive and so sensitive.</v>

5
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 1>She became touched by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

6
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to stress because depression came</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

7
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 1>She became psychotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different personalities,</v>

8
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.220
<v Speaker 1>such a beautiful woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the mother of my kids,</v>

9
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.730
<v Speaker 1>my love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen years,</v>

10
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 1>she jumped from my eighth story.</v>

11
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.923
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw the declining line of life </v>

12
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>getting out of her control that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone with four kids.</v>

13
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 1>This is life beyond this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping and couldn't do anything,</v>

14
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>but I always had this deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange feeling.</v>

15
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Something more and I don't know what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is and it's not in words.</v>

16
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a grieving from the inside,</v>

17
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>from the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from survival,</v>

18
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.643
<v Speaker 1>but it got into me like a flash and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to go on the spot to show the world </v>

19
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>that we don't need to be powerless in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of death,</v>

20
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>in the face of darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

21
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ptsd.</v>

22
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia,</v>

23
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that I was looking for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to answers of life like it</v>

24
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:09.954
<v Speaker 1>is a birthright to know why you're here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you're here as a father of two to </v>

25
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:19.014
<v Speaker 1>bring purpose sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the simple and it is being </v>

26
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>torpedoed that bill bought by all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of things and confusing sets in.</v>

27
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was too much.</v>

28
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.110
<v Speaker 1>This was the emotional tone in my heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be healed.</v>

29
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.423
<v Speaker 1>Not only to become aware of how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and to take away the documents for </v>

30
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:50.270
<v Speaker 1>those to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my journey,</v>

31
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.170
<v Speaker 1>so how to begin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I had was my instinct,</v>

32
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>my intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the way it's taught it.</v>

33
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do 26 rackets in ice.</v>

34
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:06.544
<v Speaker 1>Cold water is the most dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll go climb mount everest in his </v>

35
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:12.290
<v Speaker 1>shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would kill most people.</v>

36
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.293
<v Speaker 1>Use Swim under the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lose the way and you don't know where </v>

37
00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:21.041
<v Speaker 1>you are and and it's frozen and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know or you go,</v>

38
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.673
<v Speaker 1>you survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to stay for five to seven </v>

39
00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:29.174
<v Speaker 1>minutes every time onto the ice and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only thing I ever ate away at the </v>

40
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.373
<v Speaker 1>bedside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we have lost silence is powerful </v>

41
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dense.</v>

42
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Speaker 1>It's what I find.</v>

43
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to feel connected.</v>

44
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.790
<v Speaker 1>I showed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still the cynicism and the market,</v>

45
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.430
<v Speaker 1>not only with the scientists know world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mockery,</v>

46
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.730
<v Speaker 1>if it happens 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 years,</v>

47
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.730
<v Speaker 1>like decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really gets into you,</v>

48
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>but I just feel good so I just follow my</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>

49
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Twenty six world records later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

50
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.373
<v Speaker 1>would I can do anybody can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about becoming superman or </v>

51
00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:36.354
<v Speaker 1>superwoman or like these archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming you yourself and superior </v>

52
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.823
<v Speaker 1>to what we have learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did an experiment on me with the </v>

53
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:47.944
<v Speaker 1>Vegas nerve and to see if I was able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare to all those who weren't and </v>

54
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showed complete control over the vegas</v>

55
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>nerve which is dealing with all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organs.</v>

56
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make you nervous system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

57
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 1>and that means you have influenced their</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

58
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.443
<v Speaker 1>You have influence on inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inflammation is the cause of any </v>

59
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:18.331
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's the iceman we can do with it.</v>

60
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.013
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is an exception that confirms the </v>

61
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>rule and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

62
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:23.351
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

63
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:23.611
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

64
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I can do you can do to that a.</v>

65
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.550
<v Speaker 1>finally they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

66
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.760
<v Speaker 1>let's do a comparative study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much time do we need to teach people</v>

67
00:05:34.761 --> 00:05:39.530
<v Speaker 1>to get a little bit to the results you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have produced in a laboratory setting?</v>

68
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.543
<v Speaker 1>It took me four days to bring people </v>
<v Speaker 1>both in freezing temperatures without </v>

69
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>form experience on wantons cope town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four days later,</v>

70
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>we had endotoxemia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody doing it and 100 percent score</v>

71
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:54.604
<v Speaker 1>within a quarter of an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could suppress it and compare to </v>

72
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Speaker 1>16,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

73
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.443
<v Speaker 1>They had to compete to prove outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changed the medical books that </v>

74
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tournament's nervous system.</v>

75
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>The innate immune system into Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>system can be deeply influenced at will.</v>

76
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.423
<v Speaker 1>We have shown that because it was my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and I was hopeless then I couldn't </v>

77
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>deal with psychosis and depression or </v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

78
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Now I am so far that nature has provided</v>
<v Speaker 1>me with all the insights and Ansys and I</v>

79
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 1>brought it to brain scans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to tackle bipolar depression,</v>

80
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.963
<v Speaker 1>how to take over the power of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the brain to deal with that what </v>

81
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>causes bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>

82
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.253
<v Speaker 1>inflammation in the in the brain because</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature has the answers and what they </v>

83
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:48.554
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cancer and depression and all those </v>

84
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 1>things only with pills and chemos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

85
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:53.661
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

86
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer patients,</v>

87
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.233
<v Speaker 1>a million a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to lose those clients </v>

88
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>seek well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live off people being sick.</v>

89
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.393
<v Speaker 1>That makes a healthy economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are able to change this second world </v>

90
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.383
<v Speaker 1>ruled by people who think they can make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money out of pills and medicines and </v>

91
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 1>think that is the condition of the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>race and we have no other way.</v>

92
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.703
<v Speaker 1>The real terrorists is making us believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are not able to control our </v>

93
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.633
<v Speaker 1>inner physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the pharmaceuticals in any </v>

94
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:38.540
<v Speaker 1>other industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much they use in,</v>

95
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>in money for advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for brainwashing.</v>

96
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Our minds making us believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependency in doctors,</v>

97
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>healthcare pills and medicines and </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapies,</v>

98
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 1>that is the way to go with hell and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>look within ourselves.</v>

99
00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.640
<v Speaker 1>The are the industries will rule over </v>
<v Speaker 1>our moorings and show by data what it is</v>

100
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 1>to go in to the deepest of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiology,</v>

101
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:08.643
<v Speaker 1>at-will that makes us able to get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicines and pills and changed our </v>

102
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>capacity of what we think is possible in</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>

103
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>both mentally and physical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We take out the villain.</v>

104
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.970
<v Speaker 1>We take out a real terrorist which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing right now,</v>

105
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.700
<v Speaker 1>millions of people every year and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>war we make visible and that adding,</v>

106
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:39.803
<v Speaker 1>we are going to take data and bringing </v>
<v Speaker 1>back the belief that we are the masters </v>

107
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.140
<v Speaker 1>of our own mind.</v>
