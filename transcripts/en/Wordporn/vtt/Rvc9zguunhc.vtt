1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Specify your goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>you do that in some sense as a unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

3
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:10.974
<v Speaker 1>You want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to specify goals that make you </v>

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>if that could happen as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my efforts,</v>

6
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>it would clearly be worthwhile because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the question always is,</v>

7
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>why do something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because doing nothing is easy.</v>

8
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>You just sit there and you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's real easy.</v>

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.943
<v Speaker 1>The question is why would you ever do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and the answer that has to be </v>

10
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:29.514
<v Speaker 1>because you've determined by some means </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's worthwhile and then the next </v>

11
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

12
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>where should you look for worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and one would be,</v>

13
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:37.824
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could consult your own temperament </v>

14
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>and the other would be while you kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at how.</v>

15
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Look at what it is that people accrue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's valuable across the lifespan.</v>

16
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.963
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what so you do a structural </v>

17
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>analysis of the sub components of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence and already did that.</v>

18
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.193
<v Speaker 1>You need a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need friends like you don't need to </v>

19
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>have all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you better have most of them.</v>

20
00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.851
<v Speaker 1>Family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

21
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational goals,</v>

22
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.963
<v Speaker 1>plans for time outside of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to your mental and physical </v>

23
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:07.824
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

24
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>You know those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what life is about.</v>

25
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>And if You don't have any of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

26
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>well then all you've got left is misery </v>
<v Speaker 1>and suffering,</v>

27
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>so that's a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad deal for you.</v>

28
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so once you,</v>

29
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>once you set up that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goal structure,</v>

30
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really in many in many ways,</v>

31
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:29.560
<v Speaker 1>that's what you should be doing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities is,</v>

32
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you should</v>

33
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 2>you're doing is trying to figure out who</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is that you're trying to be,</v>

34
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.473
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you aim at that and then use </v>

35
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:39.564
<v Speaker 2>everything you learn as a means of </v>
<v Speaker 2>building that person that you want to </v>

36
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:43.314
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

37
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.633
<v Speaker 2>and I really mean want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean should be even those </v>

38
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:47.574
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things are going to overlap and </v>

39
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 2>it's important to distinguish between </v>
<v Speaker 2>those because that's partly,</v>

40
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 2>and this is back down to the micro </v>
<v Speaker 2>routine analysis.</v>

41
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:54.991
<v Speaker 2>So ashley is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

42
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 2>you're going to try to make yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>more industrious.</v>

43
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.661
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

44
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:58.494
<v Speaker 2>specify your damn goals because how are </v>
<v Speaker 2>you going to hit something if you don't </v>

45
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 2>know what it is that isn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>

46
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.893
<v Speaker 2>and often people won't specify their </v>
<v Speaker 2>goals too because they don't like to </v>

47
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:06.834
<v Speaker 2>specify conditions for failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you keep yourself all vague and </v>

48
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 2>foggy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is real easy because that's just a</v>

49
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 2>matter of not doing as well.</v>

50
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Then you don't know when you fail and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people might say,</v>

51
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:17.334
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't want to know when I fail </v>

52
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 2>because that's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll,</v>

53
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep myself blind about when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>fail.</v>

54
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 2>ThAt's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except you'll fail all the time.</v>

55
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Then you just won't know it until you </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed so badly that you're done.</v>

56
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 2>And that can easily happen by the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 40.</v>

57
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.303
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would recommend that you don't let </v>

58
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 2>that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's willful blindness,</v>

59
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have known,</v>

60
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 2>but you chose not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

61
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 2>So once you get your goal structure set </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

62
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:42.061
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

63
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 2>if I could have this life looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that might be worth living,</v>

64
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.344
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>anxiety provoking and threatening and </v>

65
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be some suffering and loss</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in all of that.</v>

66
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.183
<v Speaker 2>Obviously the goal is to to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision for your life such that all </v>

67
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 2>things considered that justifies your </v>
<v Speaker 2>effort.</v>

68
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then what do you do?</v>

69
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Well then then you turn down to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>micro routines,</v>

70
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.641
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

71
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 2>well this is what I'm aiming for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that instantiates itself day to</v>

72
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>week to week,</v>

73
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:12.484
<v Speaker 2>month to month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where something like a </v>

74
00:03:13.821 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 2>schedule can be unbelievably useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google calendar.</v>

75
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like naked damn schedule and stick </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

76
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the rule with the schedule?</v>

77
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not a bloody prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing that peter,</v>

78
00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:25.560
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

79
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.311
<v Speaker 1>will do wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

80
00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:28.590
<v Speaker 1>well I don't like to follow a schedule </v>
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>

81
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:29.424
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what kind of schedule are you </v>

82
00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:31.200
<v Speaker 1>setting up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I,</v>

83
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I have to do this,</v>

84
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:34.830
<v Speaker 1>then I have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

85
00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:35.664
<v Speaker 1>And then I just go play video games </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he wants to do all these things </v>

86
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:39.590
<v Speaker 1>that I have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like wrong.</v>

87
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Set the damn schedule up so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the day you want.</v>

88
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

89
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:46.770
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got tomorrow.</v>

90
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.813
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to set it up so it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best possible day I could have </v>

91
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.570
<v Speaker 1>practically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it look like?</v>

92
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.973
<v Speaker 1>Well then you schedule that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's a bit of </v>

93
00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:00.990
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that's going to go along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that because if you have any sense,</v>

94
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.093
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>insist upon is that at the end of the </v>

95
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.633
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in worse shape than you were </v>

96
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.910
<v Speaker 1>then at the beginning of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a stupid day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a bunch of those in a row,</v>

98
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you just dig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig yourself a hole,</v>

99
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>and then you bury yourself in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

100
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.120
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not a good strategy.</v>

101
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.313
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe 20 percent of your day has to </v>

102
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:25.290
<v Speaker 1>be responsibility and obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's more than that,</v>

103
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 1>depending on how far behind you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even that you can,</v>

104
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

105
00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:33.450
<v Speaker 1>well I've got these responsibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to schedule the damn things in.</v>

106
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.020
<v Speaker 1>What's the right ratio of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reward?</v>

107
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.123
<v Speaker 1>And you can ask yourself that just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd negotiate with someone who is </v>

108
00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>working for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

109
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:42.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta work tomorrow.</v>

110
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want you to work tomorrow.</v>

111
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:45.781
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

112
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:46.614
<v Speaker 1>well what are you going to do for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it likely that I'll work for </v>

113
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:52.140
<v Speaker 1>you while you could ask yourself that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.423
<v Speaker 1>maybe you do an hour of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of responsibility and then you play a </v>

115
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:57.300
<v Speaker 1>video game for 15 minutes.</v>

116
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever turns your crank man.</v>

117
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:00.144
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to negotiate with yourself and </v>

118
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:03.264
<v Speaker 1>not tyrannized yourself like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiating with someone that you care </v>

119
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:09.930
<v Speaker 1>for that you would like to be productive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a good life.</v>

120
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:11.880
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how you make the schedule.</v>

121
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:12.714
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at the day and you </v>

122
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:13.741
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

123
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:15.240
<v Speaker 1>if I had that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be good.</v>

124
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

125
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:18.630
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're useless and horrible.</v>

126
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.510
<v Speaker 1>So you'll probably only hit it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 70 percent accuracy,</v>

127
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>but that beats the hell out of zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

128
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:27.270
<v Speaker 1>And if you hit it even with 50 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>accuracy,</v>

129
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.433
<v Speaker 1>another rule is well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aim for 51 percent the next week or 50 </v>

130
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:32.424
<v Speaker 1>and a half percent for god's sake or </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to hit that </v>

131
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.390
<v Speaker 1>position where things start to loop back</v>
<v Speaker 1>positively and spiral you upward and so,</v>

132
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.063
<v Speaker 1>so that's one way that you can work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your conscientiousness is a plan a life </v>

133
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:46.854
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that partly by referring to </v>

134
00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:53.520
<v Speaker 1>social norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'S more or less rescuing your father</v>

135
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:54.354
<v Speaker 1>from the belly of the whale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other way you do that is by </v>

136
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>having a little with yourself</v>

137
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.323
<v Speaker 2>about as if you don't really know who </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are because you know what you're </v>

138
00:06:02.201 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't do what you're told.</v>

139
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 2>You won't do what you tell yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

140
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.063
<v Speaker 2>You must have noticed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're a bad employee and a </v>

141
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 2>worse boss and both of those work for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

142
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.420
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what you want to do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then when you tell yourself what to do,</v>

143
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.273
<v Speaker 2>you don't do it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should fire yourself and find </v>

144
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.460
<v Speaker 2>someone else to beat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

145
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point is,</v>

146
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 2>is that you have to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not your own servant,</v>

147
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:26.714
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're someone that you have to </v>

148
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:28.304
<v Speaker 2>negotiate with and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're someone that you want to </v>

149
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.370
<v Speaker 2>present the opportunity of having a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>life too.</v>

150
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's hard for people because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like themselves very much.</v>

151
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.953
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always like cracking the whip </v>

152
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:41.114
<v Speaker 2>and then procrastinating and cracking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whip and then procrastinating and </v>

153
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like so boring and such a pathetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of spending your time.</v>

154
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:51.370
<v Speaker 2>And you know what that's like because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably wasted like six hours a day and</v>

155
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

156
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.190
<v Speaker 1>we did an economic calculation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that awhile back.</v>

157
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:55.024
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an </v>

158
00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:57.610
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

159
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting paid that now,</v>

160
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.633
<v Speaker 1>but you're young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so this is investment time and what </v>

161
00:07:03.461 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 1>you do now is going to multiply its </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects in the future.</v>

162
00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:08.440
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour,</v>

163
00:07:08.441 --> 00:07:09.274
<v Speaker 1>which is perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you waste six hours a day and you </v>

164
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:13.930
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're wasting about $2,000</v>

165
00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:15.790
<v Speaker 1>a week or about $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

166
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:16.624
<v Speaker 1>So like go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what it's costing you every </v>

167
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.250
<v Speaker 1>hour and you need to know what your damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>time is worth.</v>

168
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.620
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it's not 50 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 30,</v>

169
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.690
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a hundred.</v>

170
00:07:25.691 --> 00:07:26.524
<v Speaker 1>It's somewhere in that range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that you should be </v>

171
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:31.120
<v Speaker 1>asking yourself is when you spend an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour was that,</v>

172
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:31.954
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have I paid someone 50 bucks to </v>

173
00:07:33.701 --> 00:07:36.220
<v Speaker 1>have had that hour?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that answer is no,</v>

174
00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:37.054
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you should do something else </v>

175
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:38.824
<v Speaker 1>with your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it depends on whether or not you </v>

176
00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:41.404
<v Speaker 1>think that your time is worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the funny thing about not assuming </v>

177
00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:46.750
<v Speaker 1>that is if you assume your time isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile,</v>

178
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.153
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you don't just sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>around sort of randomly in a state of </v>

179
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:55.300
<v Speaker 1>responsibility lists bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you suffer existentially.</v>
