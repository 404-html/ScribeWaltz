00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>What do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we all work too much.</v>

2
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:07.914
<v Speaker 1>I think we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been brainwashed into being that </v>

3
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:13.434
<v Speaker 1>we have to spend all our lives working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never used to do that now before the </v>

4
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>industrial revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>one would sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>the Irish for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would plant the potatoes in the,</v>

7
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it would be the sort of winter</v>

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ocean.</v>

9
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:27.864
<v Speaker 1>They plant their seed potatoes and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would sit and they would drink and </v>

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 1>they would sing and they would eat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would wait for the potatoes to come</v>

11
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was their life.</v>

13
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with it in,</v>

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.420
<v Speaker 1>in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>going to sleep for three hours in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon.</v>

16
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so civilized.</v>

17
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>But we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

18
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>the problem is we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

19
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>we're told that we're put on this planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work and we work from 8:00</v>

20
00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>in the morning till 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night or whatever.</v>

21
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.623
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we're lucky we have a Saturday </v>

22
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>off and Sunday off and then we can go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and buy things.</v>

23
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that's how life should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be for all bankrupt.</v>

24
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 1>We all owe billions of dollars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of whatevers to somebody.</v>

25
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:17.844
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure who it is we owe it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then somebody out there who's a who </v>

26
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>must be really pissed off.</v>
