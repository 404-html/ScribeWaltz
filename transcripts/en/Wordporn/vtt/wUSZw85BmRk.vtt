00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>So me and Jayda was reflecting about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I asked her,</v>

2
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did she think was,</v>

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest revelations that she </v>

4
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:19.534
<v Speaker 1>had had about love?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said that you cannot make a person </v>

5
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a person smile.</v>

6
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>You can make a person feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a person laugh,</v>

7
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.143
<v Speaker 1>but whether or not a person is happy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply and totally and utterly out of </v>

8
00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:45.701
<v Speaker 1>your control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We came into this false romantic concept</v>

9
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 1>that somehow when we got married that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>would become one.</v>

10
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.793
<v Speaker 1>And what we realized is that we were two</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely separate people on two </v>

11
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:04.484
<v Speaker 1>completely separate individual journeys </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we were choosing to walk our </v>

12
00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:15.401
<v Speaker 1>separate journey these together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her happiness was her responsibility</v>

13
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>and my happiness was my responsibility.</v>

14
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 2>We decided that we were going to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>our individual internal private,</v>

15
00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:30.814
<v Speaker 2>separate joy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we were going to present ourselves </v>

16
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.440
<v Speaker 2>to the relationship and to each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>already happened.</v>

17
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.533
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of an unrealistic and can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive to place the responsibility </v>

18
00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:54.430
<v Speaker 1>for your happiness on anybody other than</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
