00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.233
<v Speaker 1>It's something I want to tell you about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress and how we have to look at </v>

2
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:14.130
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's an important thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because many people have told me from my</v>

4
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>lectures is the one thing they remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>I was it in a dentist office and looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>at an article that said,</v>

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.590
<v Speaker 1>how do lobsters grow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how lobsters grow,</v>

7
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>but I was interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it points out that a students,</v>

8
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.453
<v Speaker 1>a soft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushy animal that lives inside of the </v>

9
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>rigid shell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rigid shell does not expand.</v>

10
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can the lobster grow?</v>

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the lobster grows,</v>

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.403
<v Speaker 1>that shell becomes very confining and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of the lobster feels itself </v>

13
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:50.544
<v Speaker 1>under pressure and uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes under a rock formation to </v>

14
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>protect itself from predatory fish casts</v>
<v Speaker 1>off Michelle and produces a new one.</v>

15
00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.813
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually that Shell becomes very </v>

16
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.094
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable as it grows in the red </v>
<v Speaker 1>back under the rocks and the lobster </v>

17
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:06.534
<v Speaker 1>repeats this numerous times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stimulus for the lobster to be able </v>

18
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:15.021
<v Speaker 1>to grow is that it feels uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

19
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>If lobsters had doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would never grow.</v>

20
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Because as soon as the lobster feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable,</v>

21
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>goes to the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a valium,</v>

22
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>gets a percocet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels fine,</v>

23
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.163
<v Speaker 1>never kept off his shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that we have to realize is </v>

24
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:28.734
<v Speaker 1>that we have to realize that times of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress are also times that are signals </v>

25
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>for growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we use adversity properly,</v>

26
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>we can grow through adversity.</v>
