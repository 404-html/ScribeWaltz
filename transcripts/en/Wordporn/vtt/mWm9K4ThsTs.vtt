00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.970
<v Speaker 1>How many hours a day you waste or how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many hours a week do you waste?</v>

2
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>The classic answer is something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>four to six hours a day.</v>

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inefficient studying,</v>

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.073
<v Speaker 1>watching things on youtube that not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you not want to watch that you don't </v>

5
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:18.734
<v Speaker 1>even care about that make you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible about watching after you're </v>

6
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably four hours right there.</v>

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you think,</v>

8
00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 2025 hours a week.</v>

9
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.440
<v Speaker 1>It's $100 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's two and a half full work weeks.</v>

10
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.620
<v Speaker 1>It's half a year of work weeks per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if your time is worth $20 an hour,</v>

11
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:37.364
<v Speaker 1>which is a radical undressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably more like 50 if you </v>

12
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:41.630
<v Speaker 1>think about it in terms of deferred </v>
<v Speaker 1>wages,</v>

13
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 1>if you're wasting 20 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wasting $50,000</v>

14
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>a year and you are doing that right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's because you're young.</v>

15
00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:50.714
<v Speaker 1>Wasting $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year is a way bigger catastrophe than </v>

16
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>it would be for me to waste it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to last nearly as long.</v>

17
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.280
<v Speaker 1>And so if your life isn't everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

18
00:00:58.281 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>you could ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.403
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if you just stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasting the opportunities that are in </v>

20
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:04.064
<v Speaker 1>front of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be who knows how much more </v>

21
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 times more efficient,</v>

22
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.470
<v Speaker 1>20 times more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the prieto distribution.</v>

23
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea how efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient people get.</v>

24
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.933
<v Speaker 1>It's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's off the charts while and if we all </v>

25
00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 1>got her act together collectively and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped making things worse,</v>

26
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:27.530
<v Speaker 1>because that's another thing people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

27
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Not only do they not do what they should</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make things better,</v>

28
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.663
<v Speaker 1>they actively attempt to make things </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse because they're spiteful or </v>

29
00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:34.934
<v Speaker 1>resentful or arrogant or deceitful or or</v>
<v Speaker 1>homicidal or genocidal or all of those </v>

30
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>things all bundled together in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely pathological package.</v>

31
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 1>If people stopped really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really trying just to make things worse,</v>

32
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.520
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea how much better they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would get just because of that.</v>

33
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.253
<v Speaker 1>So there's this weird dynamic that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the existential system of ideas </v>

34
00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:00.740
<v Speaker 1>between human vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social judgment,</v>

35
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.960
<v Speaker 1>both of which are are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

36
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.123
<v Speaker 1>are major causes of suffering and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure of individuals to adopt the </v>

37
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:10.190
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that they know they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should adopt.</v>

38
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>too is that I know like one of the,</v>

39
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 1>another thing I've asked often ask my </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate classes is,</v>

40
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea that,</v>

41
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>that people have that people have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

42
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>You know what the conscience is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

43
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.353
<v Speaker 1>it's this feeling or voice you have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your head just before you do something </v>

44
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.393
<v Speaker 1>that you know is stupid telling you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably you shouldn't do that stupid </v>

45
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to listen to it strangely</v>

46
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:38.294
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you go ahead and do it anyways and </v>

47
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:41.240
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh of course,</v>

48
00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:42.074
<v Speaker 1>exactly what the conscience told you was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen inevitably happen so </v>

49
00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:45.704
<v Speaker 1>that you'll feel even stupider about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you would if it happened by </v>

50
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>

51
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew this was going to happen.</v>

52
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I got a warning it was going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went and did it anyways.</v>

53
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing too is that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience operates within people and we</v>

54
00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>really don't understand the hell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

55
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.454
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if you abided by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience for five years or for 10 </v>

57
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of position might you be in?</v>

58
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:09.364
<v Speaker 1>What sort of family might you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of relationship might you be </v>

59
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:12.754
<v Speaker 1>able to forge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can be bloody sure that a </v>

60
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:19.591
<v Speaker 1>relationship that's forged on the basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>of who you actually are is going to be a</v>

61
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:20.674
<v Speaker 1>lot stronger and more welcome than one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's forged on the basis of who you </v>

62
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now of course that means that the person</v>

63
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:27.214
<v Speaker 1>you're with has to deal with the full </v>
<v Speaker 1>force of you in all your ability and </v>

64
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>your catastrophe and that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to negotiate.</v>

65
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>But if you do negotiate it well at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have something,</v>

66
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>you have somewhere solid to stand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have somewhere to live.</v>

67
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:42.664
<v Speaker 1>You have a real life and it's a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis upon which to bring children into </v>

68
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

69
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:48.664
<v Speaker 1>because you can have an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with them instead of </v>

70
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>torturing them half to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what happens in a tremendous,</v>

71
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>a tremendously large minority of cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>it's more than that too because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I'll close with,</v>

73
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I wanted to introduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>social knutson's writings to you.</v>

74
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:06.514
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't merely that your fate </v>

75
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:10.444
<v Speaker 1>depends on whether or not you get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>act together and to what degree you </v>

76
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>decide that you're going to live out </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own genuine being.</v>

77
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:17.884
<v Speaker 1>It isn't only your fate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the fate of everyone that you're </v>

78
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>networked with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

79
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:23.224
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.663
<v Speaker 1>there's 9 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>7 billion people in the world are going </v>

81
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>to peak at about 9 billion by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it'll decline rapidly,</v>

82
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>but 7 billion people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who are you?</v>

83
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>You're just one little dust mote among </v>
<v Speaker 1>that 7 billion.</v>

84
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>And so it really doesn't matter what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do or don't do,</v>

85
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:39.484
<v Speaker 1>but that's simply not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong model because you're at </v>

86
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>the center of a network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a node in a network.</v>

87
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.373
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's even more true now that we have </v>

88
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

89
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>you'll know a thousand people at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the course of your life,</v>

90
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.093
<v Speaker 1>and they'll know a thousand people each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that puts you one person away from </v>

91
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>1,000,002</v>
<v Speaker 1>persons away from a billion.</v>

92
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how you're connected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you do,</v>

93
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.993
<v Speaker 1>they're like dropping a stone in a pond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ripples move outward and the affect </v>

94
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>things in ways that you can't fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehend,</v>

95
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:11.314
<v Speaker 1>and it means that the things that you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you don't do are far more </v>

96
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>important than you think.</v>
