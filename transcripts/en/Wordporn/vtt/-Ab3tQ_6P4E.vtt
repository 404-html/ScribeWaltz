00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 1>went to bed and woke up this morning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't remember a thing.</v>

10
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>You've built a conscience about eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

11
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're 30 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you strap at eight years.</v>

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much traveling have you done it?</v>

15
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to church.</v>

16
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.163
<v Speaker 1>You've probably traveled two years in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life was spent just getting back and </v>

17
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:54.860
<v Speaker 1>forth to where you're going.</v>

18
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>So there's eight years of sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years of traveling.</v>

20
00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long do you sit in school?</v>

21
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.374
<v Speaker 1>In America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stayed in school from the twelfth </v>

22
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.300
<v Speaker 1>grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so from first grade to twelfth grade.</v>

23
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Same here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually it's six hours a day,</v>

24
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>six hours a day for 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Break it down.</v>

25
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 1>You sit in the classroom for three years</v>
<v Speaker 1>without leaving.</v>

26
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two years of traveling,</v>

27
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Speaker 1>eight years of sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fie years of school.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Live plays,</v>

30
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>baseball games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably two years of entertainment.</v>

31
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.523
<v Speaker 1>So by the town of Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you older people bear witness to what </v>

32
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the time you have children,</v>

33
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>by the time you have made a way for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

34
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>for the time you've paid for your home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pushing 60 years old.</v>

35
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Life is real short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

36
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're traveling at a ball.</v>

37
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.390
<v Speaker 1>You sleeping at a school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a ball unit team,</v>

38
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.020
<v Speaker 1>you probably been half your life doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and so what am I out?</v>

39
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm 35 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty more years.</v>

40
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll be 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have no more influence.</v>

41
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.783
<v Speaker 1>We can't do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of 65 wife will tell you that when </v>

42
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>you're 65,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're 65,</v>

43
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much more to do.</v>

44
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>So I'll be 65 and 30 more years in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years after sleep.</v>

45
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:22.314
<v Speaker 1>Nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have 30 years of daylight after </v>

46
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>travel back in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take six,</v>

47
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:27.204
<v Speaker 1>seven miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my traveling probably four years of </v>

48
00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 1>traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next 30 years.</v>

49
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.660
<v Speaker 1>About nine years of sleeping television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

50
00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:35.494
<v Speaker 1>and the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About three years of entertainment out </v>

51
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:40.630

<v Speaker 1>I might have about 16 years.</v>

52
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's how we can all break </v>
<v Speaker 1>individualize them.</v>
