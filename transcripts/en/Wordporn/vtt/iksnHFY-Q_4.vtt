00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.040
<v Speaker 1>She said to me once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish he would just kill yourself.</v>

2
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.670
<v Speaker 1>You're such a burden to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

3
00:00:12.671 --> 00:00:13.504
<v Speaker 1>I think I was nine when my mom drove me </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the deepest part of Baja </v>

4
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>California and she walks me up to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>orphanage and she knocks on the door and</v>

5
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:25.750
<v Speaker 1>the guy comes to the door and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found this kid,</v>

6
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.193
<v Speaker 1>and she left me there for 90 days until </v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother could get out of her </v>

7
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>where she had dumped me and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother came and rescued me.</v>

8
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.883
<v Speaker 1>My mom beat me every single day of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary school years with things you </v>

9
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>could imagine in a lot of things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't.</v>

10
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Every day my back was bloodied and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scarred.</v>

11
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to wear three tee shirts to school</v>

12
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>each day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first tee shirt,</v>

13
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>because the blood would seep through </v>
<v Speaker 1>second tee shirt.</v>

14
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>You could still see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

15
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.503
<v Speaker 1>the third tee shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't see any blood kids at </v>

16
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:12.530
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd make fun of me a fool.</v>

17
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you wearing three tee shirts?</v>

18
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>And then he stopped speaking so </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed with emotion,</v>

19
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.403
<v Speaker 1>and he seemed to be staring at a piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his story that only he could see </v>

20
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>whether he could regain his speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said through his tears,</v>

21
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.293
<v Speaker 1>I wore three tee shirts well into my </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult years because I was ashamed of my </v>

22
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want anybody to see him.</v>

23
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>But now I welcome by roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I run my fingers over my scars.</v>

24
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>My woes are my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

25
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>how can I help heal the wounded if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't welcome my own wounds in awe,</v>

26
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.063
<v Speaker 1>came upon everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The measure of our compassion lies not </v>

27
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.843
<v Speaker 1>in our service of those on the margins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only in our willingness to see </v>

28
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:36.924
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in kinship with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And indeed you have to brace yourselves </v>

29
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:45.651
<v Speaker 1>because people will accuse you of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasting your time and you stand with the</v>

30
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>poor and the powerless and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>voiceless.</v>

31
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.433
<v Speaker 1>You stand with those whose dignity has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been denied and you stand with those </v>

32
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>whose burdens are more than they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>

33
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>And you will go from here and have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>exquisite privilege once in a while,</v>

34
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:06.090
<v Speaker 1>to be able to stand with the easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>despised and the readily left out</v>

35
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.680
<v Speaker 1>with the demonized so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonizing will stop a gentle,</v>

36
00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:15.614
<v Speaker 1>kind soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's proof that only the soul that </v>

37
00:03:20.031 --> 00:03:25.031
<v Speaker 1>ventilator to the world with tenderness </v>
<v Speaker 1>has any chance of changing the world.</v>
