<v Speaker 1>Young man,</v>

2
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.893
<v Speaker 1>Fish you love to fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you took it out of the water </v>

3
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>and killed it and boiled it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

4
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:20.004
<v Speaker 1>don't tell me you love the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You love yourself and because the fish </v>

5
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:24.234
<v Speaker 1>tastes good to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore you took it out of the water </v>

6
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:32.061
<v Speaker 1>and killed it and boiled it so much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what his love is.</v>

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Fish off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and so young.</v>

8
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Couple of falls in love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young man,</v>

9
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>young woman falling in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

10
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.873
<v Speaker 1>That means that he saw in this woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who we felt could provide him </v>

11
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>with knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just physical and emotional needs,</v>

12
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.313
<v Speaker 1>and she thought this meant somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She feels that she can write that was </v>

13
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:53.484
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but each one is looking out for their </v>

14
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>own needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not love for the other.</v>

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>The other person becomes a vehicle for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my gratification,</v>

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>too much of what is called love is fish.</v>

17
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Love external love is man on what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get,</v>

18
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:10.974
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had an ethicist rabbi Tessler who </v>

19
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:15.144
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people make a serious mistake in </v>

20
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you give to those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

21
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.110
<v Speaker 1>The answer is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real answer is you love those too,</v>

22
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>and this point is if I give something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

23
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I've invested myself in you and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this self love is a given.</v>

24
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.353
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loves themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that part of me has become a new </v>

25
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's part of me knew that I love true</v>

26
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>love is a love of giving and receiving.</v>
