1
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.143
<v Speaker 1>Not An inspirational speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never lost a limb on a </v>

2
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:09.320
<v Speaker 1>mountainside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically or otherwise,</v>

3
00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:11.600
<v Speaker 1>and I'm certainly not here to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>career advice because,</v>

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.913
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never really had what most would </v>

5
00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>consider a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

6
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:16.934
<v Speaker 1>I have had large groups of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to what I say for quite a few </v>

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.910
<v Speaker 1>years now and it's given me an inflated </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of self importance.</v>

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.200
<v Speaker 1>So I will now at the ripe old age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>37.9</v>

9
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>bestow upon you nine life lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

10
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.693
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans on talent shows always talk </v>

11
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:35.900
<v Speaker 1>about their dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

12
00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:37.940
<v Speaker 1>If you have something you've always </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do,</v>

13
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>dreamed of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in your heart,</v>

14
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

15
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 1>it's something to do with your time </v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing a dream.</v>

16
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.293
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a big enough one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll take you most of your life to </v>

17
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:47.144
<v Speaker 1>achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time you get to it and are </v>

18
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:52.310
<v Speaker 1>staring into the abyss of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaninglessness of your achievement,</v>

19
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>you'll be almost dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it won't matter.</v>

20
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

21
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.033
<v Speaker 1>I never really had one of those dreams </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I advocate passionate dedication </v>

22
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>to the pursuit of short term goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Micro ambitious.</v>

23
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Put your head down and work with pride </v>
<v Speaker 1>on whatever is in front of you.</v>

24
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.900
<v Speaker 1>You never know where you might end up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just be aware.</v>

25
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>The next worthy pursuit will probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear in your periphery,</v>

26
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.020
<v Speaker 1>which is why you should be careful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm dreams.</v>

27
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.003
<v Speaker 1>If you focus too far in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't see the shiny thing out the </v>

28
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>corner of your eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>

29
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 1>don't seek happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happiness is like an orgasm.</v>

30
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes away.</v>

31
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep</v>

32
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.413
<v Speaker 1>busy and aim to make someone else happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might find you get some as a </v>

33
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:41.594
<v Speaker 1>side effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't evolve to be constantly </v>

34
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:43.934
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contented homo erectus got eaten before </v>

35
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>passing on their genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

36
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all luck.</v>

37
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.320
<v Speaker 1>You are lucky to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are incalculably.</v>

38
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.273
<v Speaker 1>Incalculably lucky to be born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understanding that you can't truly take </v>

39
00:01:58.791 --> 00:01:59.624
<v Speaker 1>credit for your successes nor truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>blame others for their failures will </v>

40
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:04.910
<v Speaker 1>humble you and make you more </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate.</v>

41
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.313
<v Speaker 1>Empathy is intuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is also something you can work on </v>

42
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 1>intellectually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>

43
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

44
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:14.564
<v Speaker 1>you pasty Pale smoking philosophy grads </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually in your eyebrows into a </v>

45
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.004
<v Speaker 1>cartesian curve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you watch the human movement mob </v>

46
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>winding their way through the miniature </v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic cones of their existence,</v>

47
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>you are wrong and they are right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:29.750
<v Speaker 1>you're half right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think therefore you are,</v>

49
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:31.580
<v Speaker 1>but also you jog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore you sleep.</v>

50
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Therefore you're not overwhelmed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential angst.</v>

51
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>You can't be Kant and you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be play a sport,</v>

52
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.470
<v Speaker 1>do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pump iron,</v>

53
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:40.041
<v Speaker 1>run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

54
00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:42.590
<v Speaker 1>but take care of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to need it.</v>

55
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Most of you mob are going to live to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly a hundred and even the poorest of</v>

56
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>you will achieve a level of wealth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>most humans throughout history could not</v>

57
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:50.084
<v Speaker 1>have dreamed of and this long luxurious </v>
<v Speaker 1>life ahead of you is going to make you </v>

58
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:58.220
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

59
00:02:58.221 --> 00:02:59.054
<v Speaker 1>be hard on your opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A famous bon mot asserts that opinions </v>

60
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>are like assholes and that everyone has </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

61
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.893
<v Speaker 1>There is great wisdom in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would add that opinions differ </v>

62
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:10.684
<v Speaker 1>significantly from assholes in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>yours should be constantly and </v>

63
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly examined.</v>

64
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.583
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

65
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>We must think critically and not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the ideas of others.</v>

66
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:25.744
<v Speaker 1>Be Hard on your beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take them out onto the veranda and hit </v>

67
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>them with a cricket bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be intellectually rigorous.</v>

68
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Identify your biases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your prejudices,</v>

69
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.204
<v Speaker 1>your privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of society's arguments are kept </v>

70
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>alive by a failure to acknowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuance.</v>

71
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.073
<v Speaker 1>We tend to generate false dichotomies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then try to argue one point using </v>

72
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:44.944
<v Speaker 1>two entirely different sets of </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions like two tennis players </v>

73
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:49.594
<v Speaker 1>trying to win a match by hitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully executed shots from either </v>

74
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:57.151
<v Speaker 1>end of separate tennis courts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six be a teacher please,</v>

75
00:03:57.641 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please be a teacher.</v>

76
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Teachers are the most admirable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>important people in the world.</v>

77
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do it forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're in doubt about what to do,</v>

78
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>be an amazing teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're not a teacher,</v>

79
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>be a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Share your ideas.</v>

80
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Don't take for granted your education.</v>

81
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Rejoice in what you learn and spray it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven,</v>

82
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.913
<v Speaker 1>define yourself by what you love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found myself doing this thing a bit </v>

83
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>recently where if someone asks me what </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of music I like,</v>

84
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:27.791
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

85
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:28.624
<v Speaker 1>I don't listen to the radio because pop </v>
<v Speaker 1>song lyrics and Nymi or if someone asks </v>

86
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:31.924
<v Speaker 1>me what food I like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think truffle oil is overused and </v>

87
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:34.984
<v Speaker 1>slightly obnoxious and I see it all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time online people whose idea of being </v>

88
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:39.664
<v Speaker 1>part of a subculture is to hate coldplay</v>
<v Speaker 1>or football or feminists or the Liberal </v>

89
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.763
<v Speaker 1>Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a tendency to define ourselves </v>

90
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>in opposition to stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a comedian,</v>

91
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>I make my living out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but try to also express your passion for</v>

92
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:53.584
<v Speaker 1>things you love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Demonstrative and generous in your </v>

93
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:56.494
<v Speaker 1>praise of those you admire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send thank you cards and give standing </v>

94
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 1>ovations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Pro stuff,</v>

95
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:01.804
<v Speaker 1>not just anti stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight respect people with less power </v>

96
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:07.024
<v Speaker 1>than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have in the past made important </v>

97
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>decisions about people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work with agents and producers,</v>

98
00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:12.664
<v Speaker 1>big decisions based largely on how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat the wait staff in the restaurants </v>

99
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>we're having the meeting in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you're the most powerful</v>

100
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:20.164
<v Speaker 1>cat in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will judge you on how you treat the </v>

101
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>least powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there nine,</v>

102
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't rush.</v>

103
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to already know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do with the rest of your</v>

104
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't panic.</v>

105
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 1>You will soon be dead.</v>

106
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

107
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Life will sometimes seem long and tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>and God,</v>

108
00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:44.190
<v Speaker 1>it's tiring and you will sometimes be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy and sometimes sad,</v>

109
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.650
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll be old and then you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be dead.</v>

110
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.623
<v Speaker 1>There is only one sensible thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this empty existence and that is </v>

111
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.840
<v Speaker 1>fill it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fill it,</v>

112
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.973
<v Speaker 1>fill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is best filled by learning as much </v>

113
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>as you can about as much as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking pride in whatever you're doing,</v>

114
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>having compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sharing ideas,</v>

115
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 1>running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being enthusiastic.</v>

116
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>And then there's love and travel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine and sex and art and kids and giving</v>

117
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>and mountain climbing.</v>
