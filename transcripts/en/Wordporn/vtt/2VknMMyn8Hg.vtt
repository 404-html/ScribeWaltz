00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.770
<v Speaker 1>So many creative people talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance</v>

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 2>failure in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 2>The fact that it's okay to make mistakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the creative process.</v>

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Then to do anything creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to take a risk.</v>

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Some kind of cognitive disinhibition is </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

6
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:24.024
<v Speaker 2>You need to cross the streams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to cross the wires just a </v>

7
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:29.004
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of madness is necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 2>connect the dots in a new way.</v>

9
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:36.684
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isaiah Berlin famously said to </v>

10
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:43.821
<v Speaker 2>understand is to perceive patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in essence what creativity is.</v>

11
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Steve Jobs says creativity is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>connecting things,</v>

12
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.113
<v Speaker 2>but in order to see patterns and rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to recombine existing patterns </v>

13
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:54.804
<v Speaker 2>into new forms and new shapes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to be willing to blur the </v>

14
00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 2>boundaries between your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

15
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 2>To be an associational thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right to free style,</v>

16
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 2>to ride a butterfly effecting thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

17
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 2>most of the time we play it safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

18
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 2>We map out what we're going to say.</v>

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 2>We preplan what we're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We make a list.</v>

20
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 2>We have a set of steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are prepared,</v>

21
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 2>we've pre scripted ours beach or we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>

22
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 2>We're not going into a situation blind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

23
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 2>once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends,</v>

24
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 2>we need to be willing to make a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to be willing to fail.</v>

25
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:32.364
<v Speaker 2>It is only when we risk making a mistake</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we might find ourselves </v>

26
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.820
<v Speaker 2>improvising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inventing,</v>

27
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 2>innovating our way back to where we want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get to.</v>

28
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:46.401
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think of this rant as a metaphor for the</v>

29
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 2>creative process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

30
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I have some what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an idea of what I want to say,</v>

31
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:52.224
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's related to creativity and it's </v>

32
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 2>related to cognitive disinhibition and </v>
<v Speaker 2>being willing to make a mistake.</v>

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 2>That's all I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I start jamming about this and what</v>

34
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 2>happens is I might lose myself in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>chain of thought,</v>

35
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

36
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of lose myself in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

37
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 2>The metaphor might like confound me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I know it,</v>

38
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:12.744
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember what I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somehow that's when the creativity </v>

39
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 2>kicks in because somehow I've got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it back.</v>

40
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I've got a rope it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to remember where I'm going.</v>

41
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 2>I've got a summon coherence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

42
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Then the Bardos between one statement </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other.</v>

43
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 2>And in doing so and in risking screwing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the video and the tape,</v>

44
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 2>it is in that risk that the courage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the innovation,</v>

45
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:43.491
<v Speaker 2>that the creativity that the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought might emerge and usually does.</v>

46
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 2>And before I know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've landed and I feel like,</v>

47
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

48
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 2>I just took a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

49
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just sailed into the great unknown and</v>

50
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I brought it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here we are.</v>

51
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>That is what creativity is all about.</v>

52
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 2>That is the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the willingness to fail and make</v>

53
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 2>a mistake that is crucial to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative process.</v>

54
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 2>So the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my fellow thinkers,</v>

55
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 2>writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>painters,</v>

56
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.973
<v Speaker 2>poets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>original doors out in the world trying </v>

57
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:12.724
<v Speaker 2>to come up with an original vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to impact humanity through their </v>

58
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 2>art and their artistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go forth,</v>

59
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>but be willing to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be willing to make a mistake,</v>

60
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.520
<v Speaker 2>pick up the pieces and try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a ride and we're in it together.</v>

62
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:28.174
<v Speaker 2>My friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if we have each other and respect </v>

63
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 2>each other and tolerate each other's </v>
<v Speaker 2>failures and failings,</v>

64
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 2>we will get to a much better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much higher,</v>

65
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.900
<v Speaker 2>much more holy place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And isn't that awesome?</v>
