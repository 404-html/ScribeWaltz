1
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I saw myself as the weakest person God </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever created.</v>

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.270
<v Speaker 1>I got called nigger every day of my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up,</v>

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.770
<v Speaker 1>living in a small town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>

4
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>one of the high ups in the KKK son sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind me two classes,</v>

5
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.750
<v Speaker 1>so he called me nigger all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my first car,</v>

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>they spray painted nigger ruin to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>you on it.</v>

7
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And I was weighing like 297 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was just an insecure,</v>

8
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.370
<v Speaker 1>scared kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the best thing that happened to me,</v>

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.683
<v Speaker 1>no one helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going to be a punk kid all my </v>

10
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way I could turn it around was to</v>

11
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.613
<v Speaker 1>suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to build calluses in my brain the </v>

12
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>same way I built calluses on my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I brought against.</v>

13
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>But the role is record for posts a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time ago.</v>

14
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.230
<v Speaker 1>But I failed at it twice and I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>67,000</v>

15
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>pullups trying to break this record.</v>

16
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>So to do 4,030</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull ups,</v>

17
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I had to do $67,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>for training for that.</v>

18
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.903
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I realized is for me to </v>

19
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:08.504
<v Speaker 1>become the man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to become a saw myself as the </v>

20
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:11.714
<v Speaker 1>weakest person God ever created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I never blamed God for anything he </v>

21
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:15.914
<v Speaker 1>did to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to change that to be the </v>

22
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>hardest man ever created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I that?</v>

23
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.933
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had to have a goal in my goal </v>

24
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>when I was sitting there not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

25
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>being bullied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being having no self esteem.</v>

26
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.150
<v Speaker 1>My goal was the only person that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn this person around is me.</v>

27
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I was so driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say motivated.</v>

28
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] motivation's crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motivation comes and goes.</v>

29
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.333
<v Speaker 1>When you're driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever's in front of you will get </v>

30
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in an external world.</v>

31
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Everything is is you get to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch it.</v>

32
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.610
<v Speaker 1>It's external.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can for the rest of your life,</v>

33
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>live inside of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop listening to people who are calling</v>

34
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>you fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay,</v>

35
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:05.210
<v Speaker 1>transsexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nigger.</v>

36
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.253
<v Speaker 1>Everything that is makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these insecure people putting their </v>

37
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>insecurities on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to flush it out.</v>

38
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 1>You gotta just be whoever the Hell God </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the hell you believe in.</v>

39
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>If you believe in nothing but yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care where it is.</v>

40
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>You got to take everything and throw it </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

41
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.393
<v Speaker 1>You have to believe in one thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is yourself and I'm not saying </v>

42
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:28.220
<v Speaker 1>don't believe in God and we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>

43
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>but right now for you to find greatness </v>
<v Speaker 1>in yourself,</v>

44
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.520
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to find it by looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a book or by even hearing me,</v>

45
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.803
<v Speaker 1>I may give you the spark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to go inside yourself to </v>

46
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:43.004
<v Speaker 1>find it.</v>

47
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>How to ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to do that?</v>

48
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Thicken your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become more of a human being.</v>

49
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.173
<v Speaker 1>Don't be afraid of the reflection in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror because that's all you can be </v>

50
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:54.464
<v Speaker 1>afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you overcome the reflection in the </v>

51
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side is greatness.</v>

52
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what people are saying by me </v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

53
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm callus in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not training for a race.</v>

54
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm training for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm training for the time.</v>

55
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>When I get that 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning call,</v>

56
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>my mom is dead or something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tragic in life.</v>

57
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm training my mind and my body,</v>

58
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:20.803
<v Speaker 1>my spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's all one so I can handle what </v>

59
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>life is gonna throw at me because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>life I've lived,</v>

60
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.883
<v Speaker 1>it throws a whole bunch at you and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not physically and mentally </v>

61
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:30.874
<v Speaker 1>prepare for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to crumble and you're </v>

62
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.204
<v Speaker 1>good for nobody.</v>

63
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.223
<v Speaker 1>In Times of suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do is we forget how hard we </v>

64
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>really are because that's what suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

65
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Suffering's a test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

66
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Suffering is the true test of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beauty is remembering this young,</v>

67
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 1>dumb what people called Nigger is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I'm at today,</v>

68
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>and that is when you finally get to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

69
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's forever lasting peace.</v>

70
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Greatness isn't running towards your </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles at the time of doing 40,000</v>

71
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.294
<v Speaker 1>posts of being a seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greatness is whatever the hell you </v>

72
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>dreamed of in your own mind.</v>

<v Speaker 1>vision in your mind is how am I going to</v>

<v Speaker 1>No matter if you are fat,</v>

<v Speaker 1>matter if you just got back from Iraq or</v>

<v Speaker 1>bose headphones on and silence the noise</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of this world in defined it that </v>

00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:52.920
