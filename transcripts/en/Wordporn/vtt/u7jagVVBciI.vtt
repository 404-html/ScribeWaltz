00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.070
<v Speaker 1>You happy with what you got because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>owners of this country don't want that.</v>

2
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.120

<v Speaker 1>the real owners,</v>

3
00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:14.954
<v Speaker 1>the big wealthy business interests that </v>
<v Speaker 1>control things and make all the </v>

4
00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>important decisions they get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The politicians,</v>

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.313
<v Speaker 1>the politicians are put there to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you the idea that you have freedom of </v>

6
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:24.950
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.040
<v Speaker 1>You have no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have owners,</v>

8
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.130

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>They own all the important land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They own and control the corporations.</v>

10
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.860
<v Speaker 1>They've long since bought and paid for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Senate,</v>

11
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>the Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state houses and city halls.</v>

12
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>They got the back pockets and they own </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the big media company,</v>

13
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>so they control just about all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news and information.</v>

14
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:47.240
<v Speaker 1>You get to here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got you by the balls.</v>

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>They spend billions of dollars every </v>
<v Speaker 1>year lobbying to get what they want.</v>

16
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what they want.</v>

17
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>They want more for themselves and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>for everybody else,</v>

18
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you what they don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want a population of citizens</v>

19
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>capable of critical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want well informed,</v>

20
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>well educated people capable of critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

21
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Then I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't that that doesn't help them.</v>

22
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 1>That's against their interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they want.</v>

23
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>They want obedient workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obedient workers,</v>

24
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.303
<v Speaker 1>people who are just smart enough to run </v>
<v Speaker 1>the machines and do the paperwork and </v>

25
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:22.754
<v Speaker 1>just dumb enough to passively accept all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these increasingly shittier jobs with </v>

26
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.213
<v Speaker 1>lower pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the longer hours to reduce benefits to </v>

27
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>the end of overtime and the vanishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>pension.</v>

28
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:32.084
<v Speaker 1>That disappears the minute you go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collect it and now they're coming for </v>

29
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:35.444

<v Speaker 1>their criminal friends on Wall Street </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know something.</v>

32

<v Speaker 1>They'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll get it all from you sooner or </v>

33
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>later because they own this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 1>telling you what to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they think and what to buy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The table is tilted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nobody seems to notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody seems to care.</v>

42

<v Speaker 1>suckers who don't give a fuck about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

45
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 1>It's called the American dream because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be asleep to believe it.</v>

46
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Things are nothing more than ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle beast savages.</v>

47
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.180

<v Speaker 1>Our DNA hasn't changed substantially in </v>

50
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

51
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>We're still operating out of the lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

52
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.290
<v Speaker 1>The reptilian brain fight or flight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill or be killed.</v>

53
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.543
<v Speaker 1>Now we like to think we've evolved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance because we can build a computer </v>

54
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:54.550
<v Speaker 1>flying airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel underwater.</v>
