1
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.223
<v Speaker 1>Ideas where nothing with that an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I say that a desire for an idea is </v>

2
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:16.124
<v Speaker 1>like a bait on a hook and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>desiring an idea and you have to have </v>

3
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:23.834
<v Speaker 1>patients just like you do in fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How deep that hook goes depends on the </v>

4
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>size of that ball of consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>designer.</v>

5
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Another word for it is like focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just focus on some and it's a little bit</v>

6
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>like daydreaming spots come and Fox </v>
<v Speaker 1>common stocks come and meet me.</v>

7
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An idea of condoms that is so thrilling.</v>

8
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.340
<v Speaker 1>You've caught a little purple fish with </v>
<v Speaker 1>red fins and and little little dancing,</v>

9
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>speckled eyes and this little fish could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be just a fragment,</v>

10
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>but you love this fragment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You love this fish and that idea,</v>

11
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:11.120
<v Speaker 1>you write it down so you won't forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

12
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.733
<v Speaker 1>Then now that you have that fish even </v>
<v Speaker 1>more powerful bait and soon others will </v>

13
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:19.394
<v Speaker 1>swim in and join to it and the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>will start emerging and it goes like </v>

14
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 1>that for me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragments,</v>

15
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.823
<v Speaker 1>but it's all ideas coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that I've fallen in love with and </v>

16
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm an a fallen in love with different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

17
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Then you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's billions,</v>

18
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>trillions of ideas coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas for everything.</v>

19
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.510
<v Speaker 1>So that's how it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it goes.</v>

20
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:46.511
<v Speaker 1>Then you get the ideas organized and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you translate those ideas and along</v>

21
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:51.530
<v Speaker 1>the way you stay open because the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't finished til it's finished.</v>

22
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>There can be happy accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

23
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>how did I get so lucky to get this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

24
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was complete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is beyond the beyond fitting in</v>

25
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:03.194
<v Speaker 1>here and jumping it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay on your toes and don't walk away </v>

26
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:12.131
<v Speaker 1>from any element until it feels correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's built out of many,</v>

27
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:14.420
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many elements.</v>

28
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Stay true to the idea all along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>

29
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:20.000
<v Speaker 1>and then you have some hope of the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
