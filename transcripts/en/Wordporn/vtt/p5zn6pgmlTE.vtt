00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine a world where 10 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are happier?</v>

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>My my I'd go to them is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I developed it because I could not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really define what happiness was,</v>

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.833
<v Speaker 1>so I took as many arbitrary points of </v>
<v Speaker 1>data where I felt happy and try to find </v>

5
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:23.604
<v Speaker 1>what was common between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was common between them was the </v>

6
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.053
<v Speaker 1>equation of happiness and it is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness is equal to or greater than </v>

7
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:30.744
<v Speaker 1>the difference between the way you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the events of your life and your </v>

8
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>expectation of how life should behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the modern world.</v>

9
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.023
<v Speaker 1>We mixed two states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is happiness and the other </v>

10
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happiness is that peaceful,</v>

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>contentment feeling of I like the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it is right now.</v>

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Fun is the modern world's replacement of</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.693
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when I am unable to reach that </v>

14
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>state of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I do is I go out on the weekend and</v>

15
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I go to a party and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

16
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:00.984
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

17
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>My brain stops thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as it's stops thinking I fee,</v>

18
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:06.294
<v Speaker 1>I think I feel happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happiness is not about what the world </v>

19
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Speaker 1>gives you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much water is in this class?</v>

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Happiness is about what you think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the word gives you.</v>

21
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will always see that as something to</v>

22
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>be grateful for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to be happy about.</v>

23
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I think losing it was the call to </v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

24
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I lost my son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden like from,</v>

25
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from having a happy holiday together to </v>

26
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:34.654
<v Speaker 1>losing him was four hours and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question that hits me at the time was </v>

27
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>what can I do now to bring him back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing I could have ever done including</v>

28
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.683
<v Speaker 1>locking my sense in the room and crying </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of my life would bring him </v>

29
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:50.644
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me the whole idea was I can </v>

30
00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:55.354
<v Speaker 1>either choose to suffer or I can choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of accept life as harsh as it </v>

31
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 1>has become and try to make it slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than it is today.</v>

32
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 1>So let's make it slightly better </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

33
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>So the way I did it was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

34
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically set myself a target.</v>

35
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.523
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be amazing if I can reach </v>

36
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 1>out to 10 million people and just give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them that message?</v>

37
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.483
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't bring it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would be likely that they'd been </v>

38
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is truly,</v>

39
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.840
<v Speaker 1>truly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say successful my life.</v>

40
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.590
<v Speaker 1>That has never been a moment in my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I felt I was having a better impact</v>

41
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:33.424
<v Speaker 1>on the Ndis.</v>
