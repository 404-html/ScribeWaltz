00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you three stories from my</v>

2
00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:07.604
<v Speaker 1>life at that time offered perhaps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best calligraphy instruction in the </v>

3
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 1>country throughout the campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every poster,</v>

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.743
<v Speaker 1>every label on every drawer was </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully hand calligraphic because I </v>

5
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>had dropped out and didn't have to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal classes.</v>

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I decided to take a calligraphy class to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to do this.</v>

7
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.260
<v Speaker 1>None of this had even a hope of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical application in my life,</v>

8
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>but 10 years later when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>designing the first macintosh computer,</v>

9
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>it all came back to me and we designed </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all into the Mac.</v>

10
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>It was the first computer with beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>typography.</v>

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.183
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was impossible to connect the dots </v>

12
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>looking forward when I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was very,</v>

13
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking backwards.</v>

14
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Ten years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>you can't connect the dots looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

16
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.973
<v Speaker 1>You can only connect them looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards so you have to trust that the </v>

17
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 1>dots will somehow connect in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

18
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>You have to trust in something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your gut destiny,</v>

19
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karma,</v>

20
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:11.240
<v Speaker 1>whatever was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started apple in my parents garage</v>

21
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>when I was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We worked hard and in 10 years apple had</v>

22
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>grown from just the two of us in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garage into a $2,000,000,000</v>

23
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>company with over 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>

24
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>We just released our finest creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the macintosh a year earlier,</v>

25
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>and I just turned 30 and then I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>fired,</v>

26
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 1>but something slowly began to dawn on </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

27
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I still loved what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been rejected,</v>

28
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.330
<v Speaker 1>but I was still in love and so I decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start over.</v>

29
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.583
<v Speaker 1>The heaviness of being successful was </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced by the lightness of being a </v>

30
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:46.634
<v Speaker 1>beginner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

31
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 1>less sure about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the next five years,</v>

32
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I started a company named next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another company named Pixar.</v>

33
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Pixar went on to create the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>first computer animated feature film and</v>

34
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>is now the most successful animation </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio in the world.</v>

35
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.023
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept me going was that I loved what I </v>

36
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:05.234
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to find what you love and the </v>

37
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.420
<v Speaker 1>only way to be truly satisfied is to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you believe is great work,</v>

38
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 1>and the only way to do great work is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>love what you do.</v>

39
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't found it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep looking and don't settle.</v>

40
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.373
<v Speaker 1>Your time is limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't waste it living someone else's </v>

41
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:25.484
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't let the noise of other's opinions </v>

42
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 1>drowned out your own inner voice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most important,</v>

43
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.560
<v Speaker 1>have the courage to follow your heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and intuition.</v>

44
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.160
<v Speaker 1>They somehow already know what you truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>
