1
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.353
<v Speaker 1>The concept of anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to think about the </v>

2
00:00:09.171 --> 00:00:12.710
<v Speaker 1>phases of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are three phases of anger.</v>

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 1>One is somebody provokes me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel angry.</v>

4
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any control over that.</v>

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.073
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the phase of anger of how </v>

6
00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>do I react to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I walk away?</v>

7
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Do I respond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I punch the guy in the face,</v>

8
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.700
<v Speaker 1>but I call them with something in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my reaction to anger,</v>

9
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.180
<v Speaker 1>and then the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

10
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.350
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any choice to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling angry when I was provoked.</v>

11
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 1>How long am I going to hold onto that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger?</v>

12
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 1>An hour a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 years,</v>

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in order to keep things straight,</v>

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I give these three phases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three different names,</v>

15
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call anger.</v>

16
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>The reaction to anger I call rage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hanging onto the anger is called</v>

17
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

18
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>And then as you clarify and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

19
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.123
<v Speaker 1>I can do nothing about my feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger other than perhaps take some </v>

20
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>things in perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.113
<v Speaker 1>One of my father's teachings that helped</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a great deal was that when somebody </v>

22
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>did something to my father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should have a provoked anger,</v>

23
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>my father would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.793
<v Speaker 1>what he did was so foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he only knew how fully said was what </v>

25
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:38.360
<v Speaker 1>he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't have done it.</v>

26
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.110
<v Speaker 1>I feel sorry for the person for being </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a fool,</v>

28
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>but if she feels sorry for a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you be angry at him?</v>

29
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel pity for him.</v>

30
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Pity and anger girl doesn't go together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

31
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.433
<v Speaker 1>but nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't control how I feel when </v>

32
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:54.734
<v Speaker 1>provoked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I certainly can't control what my </v>

33
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>reaction is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>

34
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.933
<v Speaker 1>how long do I hang on to the resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like greatest lesson came from </v>

35
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:07.280
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics anonymous where somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

36
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.863
<v Speaker 1>harboring your resentment is allowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who you don't like to live </v>

37
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>inside your head without paying any </v>
<v Speaker 1>rent.</v>

38
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.493
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not that kind of a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a nice guy like that to let </v>

39
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

40
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.480
<v Speaker 1>So Aa helped me get rid of resentments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

41
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.403
<v Speaker 1>reacting to anger took me awhile to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to control my rage and then I had </v>

42
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>to realize that this is part of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

43
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Human animals react with rage when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when provoked,</v>

44
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I as a human being,</v>

45
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>am I supposed to be above that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle earth and Homo sapiens.</v>

46
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 1>So I learned how to control my anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think those are.</v>

47
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 1>If a person keeps those things in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And there's some people who feel guilty </v>
<v Speaker 1>for feeling angry,</v>

49
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially a parent.</v>

50
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.600
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.760
<v Speaker 1>The feeling of anger is loving yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't have a choice,</v>

52
00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>there's was a reason to feel guilty </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

53
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>How you react.</v>

54
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.100
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My suggestion is keep an anger journal.</v>

55
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what happened today,</v>

56
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did this is at,</v>

57
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.760
<v Speaker 1>and here's how I did right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then at night,</v>

58
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.613
<v Speaker 1>is it at the time that I'm provoked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it gives them clear because I'm </v>

59
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:28.294
<v Speaker 1>under pressure to respond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at night when I look over what </v>

60
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:33.064
<v Speaker 1>happened during the daytime and I say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I handled that in the best way </v>

61
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:37.744
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could I have done something better and </v>

62
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:42.710
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a lesson for the next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

63
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.030
<v Speaker 1>so I think keeping a journal about anger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how we respond to it is an excellent</v>

64
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>way overnight because ultimately if I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>an raged,</v>

65
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hurt the other person as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it hurts me.</v>
