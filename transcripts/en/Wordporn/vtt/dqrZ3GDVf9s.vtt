1
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.020
<v Speaker 1>So much better than your performing </v>
<v Speaker 1>under pressure,</v>

2
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>whether it's me or anybody else is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

3
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.313
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the same pressures as anyone </v>

4
00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's time,</v>

5
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>there's performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's financial.</v>

6
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>there's deadlines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My pressures are not unique.</v>

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has the same kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressures.</v>

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I found,</v>

10
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.620
<v Speaker 1>what I find fascinating is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of the stimuli.</v>

11
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was watching the Olympics this last</v>

12
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.883
<v Speaker 1>summer leopards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was amazed at how bad the </v>

13
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 1>questions were that the reporters would </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask all the athletes,</v>

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.573
<v Speaker 1>and almost always they asked the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>question whether they were about to </v>

15
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 1>compete or after they competed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you nervous?</v>

16
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to a t,</v>

17
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.900
<v Speaker 1>all the athletes went no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

18
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>And what I realized is it's not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not nervous,</v>

19
00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>it's their interpretation of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in their bodies.</v>

20
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

21
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you're nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Your heart rate starts to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

23
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of get a little tense.</v>

24
00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>You get a little sweaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>You have the expectation of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

26
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>And we interpreted that as I'm nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

27
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>What's the interpretation of excited?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your heart rate starts to go.</v>

28
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Speaker 1>You become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're anticipating what's coming,</v>

29
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a little sort of like tense.</v>

30
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:26.554
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same stimuli except these </v>

31
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

32
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.513
<v Speaker 1>these Olympic quality athletes have </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned to interpret the stimuli that </v>

33
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:36.430
<v Speaker 1>the rest of us would say as nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as excited.</v>

34
00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>They all said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

35
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited.</v>

36
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.073
<v Speaker 1>And so I've actually practiced it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell myself when I start to get </v>

37
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>nervous that this is excitement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

38
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.070
<v Speaker 1>And so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

39
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.860
<v Speaker 1>I used to speak in front of a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and somebody would say,</v>

40
00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying little nervous.</v>

41
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Now when somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel?</v>

42
00:01:54.941 --> 00:01:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really excited actually.</v>

43
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.053
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came from just sort of telling </v>

44
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

45
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:01.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

46
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 1>this is excitement and it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit automatic later on.</v>

47
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of a remarkable thing to </v>

48
00:02:07.871 --> 00:02:08.704
<v Speaker 1>deal with pressure by interpreting what </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body is experiencing as excitement </v>

49
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>rather than nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really kind of effective.</v>

50
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.513
<v Speaker 1>It makes you want them to rush forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than pull back and yet it's the </v>

51
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:18.274
<v Speaker 1>same experience.</v>
