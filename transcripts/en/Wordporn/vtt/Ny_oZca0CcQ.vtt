1
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Sunday school teacher by day and a sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>addict ignite.</v>

2
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>you won't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got her going out.</v>

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.943
<v Speaker 1>We got her with the men and we get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show her and she was willing to show us </v>

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.443
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat down with a woman for the </v>

6
00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:30.601
<v Speaker 1>interview that was taped and during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of the interview I said,</v>

7
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.220
<v Speaker 1>why are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

8
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to help people.</v>

9
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell my story and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help people.</v>

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have children?</v>

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.043
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

12
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>I have a 10 year old son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew right then this is never going to</v>

13
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:45.314
<v Speaker 1>see the light of day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got off the air and I said to the </v>

14
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are not going to air that show.</v>

15
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.840
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

16
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 1>My producer said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why she knew she was being filmed.</v>

17
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.003
<v Speaker 1>She knew what she was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knows what I said because her son </v>

18
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 1>will never get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always know it's the right thing.</v>

19
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:09.704
<v Speaker 1>When in the end there was peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are rewarded by peace in knowing </v>

20
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.233
<v Speaker 1>that you did the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three things that I want to leave </v>

21
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:26.051
<v Speaker 1>with you will carry you if you let them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first and foremost,</v>

22
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.350
<v Speaker 1>knowing who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to answer this question,</v>

23
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.563
<v Speaker 1>who am I and what do I want so I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking for the roles that you play as a </v>

24
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a friend,</v>

25
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>as a sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be a lawyer.</v>

26
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>You're going to teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a pharmacist.</v>

27
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking the bigger question of who am</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and what do I want?</v>

28
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to just be successful in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

29
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.073
<v Speaker 1>I want to fulfill the highest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truest expression of myself as a human </v>

30
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:12.044
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

31
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.843
<v Speaker 1>I want to fulfill the promise that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creator dreamed when he dreamed the </v>

32
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:20.684
<v Speaker 1>cells that made me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must have some kind of vision for </v>

33
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't know the plan.</v>

34
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a direction in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>you choose to go.</v>

35
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>You want to be in the driver's seat of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own life because if you're not,</v>

36
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 1>life will drive you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

37
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.413
<v Speaker 1>you must find a way to serve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King said that not </v>

38
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:52.754
<v Speaker 1>everybody can be famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody can be great because </v>

39
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:59.681
<v Speaker 1>greatness is determined by service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you shift the of whatever it is you</v>

40
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>choose to do to service and you bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance to that,</v>

41
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>success will I promise you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow you.</v>

42
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>That's number two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>

43
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>it's so simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so hard to do.</v>

44
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Always do the right thing.</v>
