00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.260
<v Speaker 1>The physical universe is basically it </v>
<v Speaker 1>playful.</v>

2
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>There is no necessity for it whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't going anywhere.</v>

3
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.103
<v Speaker 1>That is to say it doesn't have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>destination that it ought to arrive at </v>

4
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.173
<v Speaker 1>that it is best understood by analogy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with music because music as an art form </v>

5
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>is essentially playful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We say you play the piano,</v>

6
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.503
<v Speaker 1>you don't work the piano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why music differs from say travel when </v>

7
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:37.824
<v Speaker 1>you travel you are trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in music though one doesn't </v>

8
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:45.294
<v Speaker 1>make the end all the composition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point if that was so the best </v>

9
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:51.704
<v Speaker 1>conductors would be those who played </v>
<v Speaker 1>faster and there would be composers who </v>

10
00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:59.711
<v Speaker 1>wrote of lifting people go to concert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hear one crashing call cause that's</v>

11
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say went dancing.</v>

12
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't aim at a particular spot in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the room.</v>

13
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.563
<v Speaker 1>That's where you should arrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of the dancing of the </v>

14
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:08.714
<v Speaker 1>doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't see that as something </v>

15
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>brought by our education into our </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday conduct.</v>

16
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>We've got a system of schooling but </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives a completely different impression.</v>

17
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>It's all graded and what we do is we put</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child into the corridor of this raid</v>

18
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:26.361
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>it kind of come on Kitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kitty,</v>

20
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>kitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.853
<v Speaker 1>You go to kindergarten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's a great thing because </v>

22
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.913
<v Speaker 1>when you finish that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get into first grade and then </v>

23
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:37.690
<v Speaker 1>come on first grade needs the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>grade and so on.</v>

24
00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:38.524
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd get out of grade school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got high school and it's revving </v>

25
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is coming.</v>

26
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Then you're going to go to college by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jovan.</v>

27
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>You get into graduate school and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're through with graduate school,</v>

28
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.323
<v Speaker 1>you go out to join the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll get into some racket where </v>

29
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:53.074
<v Speaker 1>you're selling insurance and they've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>that quota to make and you're going to </v>

30
00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:58.570
<v Speaker 1>make that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all the time the thing is coming,</v>

31
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.220
<v Speaker 1>it's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming.</v>

32
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>That great thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the success you're working.</v>

33
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.960
<v Speaker 1>And then when you wake up one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 40 years old,</v>

34
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

35
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I've arrived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm there.</v>

36
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>And you don't feel very different from </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you always felt.</v>

37
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would the people who live to retire</v>

38
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.913
<v Speaker 1>and put those savings away and then when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they 65 they don't have any energy left </v>

39
00:02:23.411 --> 00:02:24.244
<v Speaker 1>that more or less important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go and in an old people's </v>

40
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 1>senior citizens community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've sinned,</v>

41
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:31.274
<v Speaker 1>did cheated ourselves the whole way down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line did we thought of life by </v>

42
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:36.234
<v Speaker 1>analogy with a journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a pilgrimage which had a serious </v>

43
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:40.314
<v Speaker 1>purpose at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing was to get to that end </v>

44
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>success or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe Heaven after you're dead,</v>

45
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 1>but we missed the point the whole way </v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

46
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.713
<v Speaker 1>It was a musical thing and you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to sing or to dance while the </v>

47
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.650
<v Speaker 1>music was being played.</v>
