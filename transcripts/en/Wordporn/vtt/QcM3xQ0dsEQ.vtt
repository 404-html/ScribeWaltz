00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.353
<v Speaker 1>When no one listens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel that once they see to all sorts </v>

2
00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>of things start to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

3
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:11.024
<v Speaker 1>you have so much pain inside yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you try and hurt yourself on the </v>

4
00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:15.344
<v Speaker 1>outside because you want help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the wrong help you're asking </v>

5
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:18.704
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People see it as crying wolf or </v>

6
00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 1>attention seeking and they think because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the media all the time,</v>

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>you've got enough attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inverted commerce.</v>

8
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.713
<v Speaker 1>But I was actually crying out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to get better in order to go </v>

9
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Speaker 1>forward and continue my duty and my role</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a wife,</v>

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.250
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Princess of Wales.</v>

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.190
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did influx for myself.</v>

13
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.453
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was ashamed because I couldn't cope </v>

14
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:44.840
<v Speaker 1>with the pressures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you actually do?</v>

15
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just taught my arms my next and I work</v>

16
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.983
<v Speaker 1>in environments now where I see women </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing similar things and I'm able to </v>

17
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>understand completely where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from.</v>

18
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.843
<v Speaker 1>I think every strong woman in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>has had to walk down a similar path and </v>

19
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:05.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the strength that causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the confusion,</v>

20
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.270
<v Speaker 1>the fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is she strong?</v>

21
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Where does she get it from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where she lives?</v>

22
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.053
<v Speaker 1>She going to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to be a queen of people's </v>

23
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>hearts and people's hearts and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see myself being queen,</v>

24
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.293
<v Speaker 1>just country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think many people would want me </v>

25
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>to be queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

26
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>when I say many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean established time,</v>

27
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>married into because they've decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salta.</v>

28
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.603
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they've decided?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I do things differently because </v>

29
00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go by when we book because </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutral,</v>

30
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>the whole not the head and that's got me</v>
<v Speaker 1>into trouble in my work.</v>

31
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I understand that and show it.</v>
