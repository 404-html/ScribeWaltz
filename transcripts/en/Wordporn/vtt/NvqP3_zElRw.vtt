1
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.973
<v Speaker 1>Anger around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>privately held with a lot of us go </v>

2
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>around feeling quite enraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>

3
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>privately about the way that I love </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives have gone.</v>

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>My task today is to turn that into </v>
<v Speaker 1>sadness.</v>

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>If we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we managed to turn rage into grief,</v>

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.403
<v Speaker 1>we will have made psychological progress</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the task today is behind </v>

7
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>rage very often is an unusual quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we tend to feed the hungry.</v>

8
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:38.694
<v Speaker 1>People are sort of dark and pessimistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters absolutely not scratch the </v>

9
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:47.751
<v Speaker 1>surface of any regularly angry person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you will find a wild optimist.</v>

10
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.823
<v Speaker 1>It is in fact that drives range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of the person who screens every </v>

11
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>time they can't find their housekeeper </v>
<v Speaker 1>or every time they get stuck in traffic.</v>

12
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>These unfortunate characters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>evincing,</v>

13
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>a curious but reckless faith in a world </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which keys never go astray.</v>

14
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>The roads are mysteriously traffic free.</v>

15
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>It is hope that is turbocharging rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if were to get a little bit less sad,</v>

16
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.933
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as a little less angry about our </v>

17
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>love lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will have to diminish.</v>

18
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:18.294
<v Speaker 1>Some of the reason is that all of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>will not manage to find the right </v>

19
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we will probably all of us manage to</v>

20
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>find a good enough so and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

21
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.113
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know very much how to love and </v>

22
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>it sounds very odd because it actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said,</v>

23
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:38.694
<v Speaker 1>you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us probably in this room would </v>

24
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>probably need to go to a school of law </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a school of love.</v>

25
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Love is just an instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

26
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a skill and it's a skill that needs</v>

27
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:47.904
<v Speaker 1>to be learned and it's a skill of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our society refuses to consider as a </v>

28
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.444
<v Speaker 1>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are meant to always just follow our </v>

29
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

30
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.083
<v Speaker 1>If you keep following your feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will almost certainly make a big </v>

31
00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>mistake in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is love?</v>

32
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love,</v>

33
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I believe is something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

34
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a distinction between loving and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being loved.</v>

35
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>We all start off in life by knowing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot about being loved.</v>

36
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Being loved is the funded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>that's when somebody brings you </v>
<v Speaker 1>something on a tray and ask you how your</v>

38
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:14.004
<v Speaker 1>day at school went to federal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we grow up thinking that that is </v>

39
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen in an adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

40
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>We can be forgiven for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an understandable mistake,</v>

41
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.173
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very tragic mistake and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads us not to pay attention to the </v>

42
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>other side of the equation which is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

43
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.473
<v Speaker 1>And what does it really mean to love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to love ultimately is to have the </v>

44
00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:33.700
<v Speaker 1>willingness to interpret someone's on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface,</v>

45
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.563
<v Speaker 1>not very appealing behavior in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find more benevolent reasons why it may </v>

46
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:39.574
<v Speaker 1>be unfolding.</v>

47
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.473
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to love someone is to apply charity and </v>

48
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>generosity of interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem is we live in a romantic culture</v>

49
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>that privileges impulse and when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to love,</v>

50
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.323
<v Speaker 1>something tricky occurs because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to be a paid up believer in </v>

51
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:55.914
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy or psychoanalysis to </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that the way we love as adults </v>

52
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>sits on top of our early childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences and in early childhood.</v>

53
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.713
<v Speaker 1>The way that we learned about love was </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just via experiences of tenderness </v>

54
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:09.904
<v Speaker 1>and kindness and generosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The love that we would have tasted his </v>

55
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>children will also be bound up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences of being let down,</v>

56
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.930
<v Speaker 1>being humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe being with a parent who treated us</v>

57
00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>very harshly scolded us or made us feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>small in some way.</v>

58
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.623
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot about our early experiences </v>

59
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:28.414
<v Speaker 1>of love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bound up with various kinds of </v>

60
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:30.634
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now something quite bad happens when we </v>

61
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.970
<v Speaker 1>start to go out into the adult world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to choose love partners.</v>

62
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>We think we're out to find partners who </v>
<v Speaker 1>will make us happy,</v>

63
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.253
<v Speaker 1>but we were out to find partners who </v>
<v Speaker 1>will feel familiar and that may be a </v>

64
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:46.414
<v Speaker 1>very different thing.</v>
