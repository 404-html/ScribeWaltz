1
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I have to make notes because a lot of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration comes from meeting people or</v>

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.943
<v Speaker 1>going outside of the country or going </v>
<v Speaker 1>around a corner and tomorrow </v>

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and talking to a five year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old little boy.</v>

4
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>It's mainly kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I always say this kids bugging me out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have no fear,</v>

6
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My little niece,</v>

7
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>she's two years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's fierce,</v>

8
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 1>nothing and she has no concept of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality as we know it.</v>

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>That always inspired me to write for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some reason,</v>

10
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives me a moment.</v>

11
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Talking to them gives me a moment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>step back and look at the world for what</v>

12
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:51.101
<v Speaker 1>I know this case is that always tripped </v>
<v Speaker 1>me out cause I told them about the story</v>

13
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>when I seen him when I was eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine years old with two on Rosecrans.</v>

14
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.923
<v Speaker 1>We're shooting a video of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood in Compton when two blocks </v>

15
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:07.790
<v Speaker 1>down and got me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time we got me,</v>

16
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>everybody was out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like pandemonium.</v>

17
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>He put me on his shoulders and that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was Dr Dre and um,</v>

18
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.531
<v Speaker 1>two part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

19
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:16.364
<v Speaker 1>Then fast forward 15 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the studio world and I'm telling </v>

20
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:20.514
<v Speaker 1>him that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of the kids out there as much </v>

21
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.210
<v Speaker 1>as he remembers him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy,</v>

22
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>crazy to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just me being an ultimate fan,</v>

23
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:29.984
<v Speaker 1>I'm still a fan to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to actually sit down and have </v>

24
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.153
<v Speaker 1>conversations beyond the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't just a figment of my </v>

25
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:38.810
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching on TV screen.</v>

26
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.483
<v Speaker 1>The people are watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't get there on a pure </v>

27
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.673
<v Speaker 1>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually worked hard and they are </v>

28
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're real emotion,</v>

29
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.500
<v Speaker 1>real dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real consistency,</v>

30
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.513
<v Speaker 1>real hunger.</v>

31
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.583
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep down we're all kids at heart and I </v>

32
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Speaker 1>know I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the biggest kid,</v>

33
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can be able to relate and </v>

34
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:03.434
<v Speaker 1>communicate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with them in a way that I </v>

35
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:06.944
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most adults can't sit there and hold a </v>

36
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.510
<v Speaker 1>and go back to the studio man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or write them most bugged out song,</v>

38
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because it just gave me,</v>

39
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:17.984
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives me a chance to sit back and </v>

40
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:20.534
<v Speaker 1>allow myself and look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives of the different spectrum </v>

41
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>of having responsibilities and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>having any at all.</v>

42
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.953
<v Speaker 1>And I have to remember these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to write them down and then five </v>

43
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:37.634
<v Speaker 1>or three months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to find that same emotion that I </v>

44
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:45.161
<v Speaker 1>felt when I was inspired by definite </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

45
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>It's working process.</v>
