00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.400
<v Speaker 1>You want to change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start from yourself and work outward</v>

2
00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:09.200
<v Speaker 1>because you build your competence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.303
<v Speaker 1>So like I don't know how you can go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and protest the structure of the entire </v>

4
00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:15.410
<v Speaker 1>economic system if can't keep your room </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized.</v>

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>People try to change the outside world </v>
<v Speaker 1>for lots of ways,</v>

6
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:21.380
<v Speaker 1>but many of those ways aren't just pure </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.663
<v Speaker 1>And so what I've thought about is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what you start to do is you start </v>

8
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:26.084
<v Speaker 1>to tail and act out the truth locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like within the domain of your actual </v>

9
00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>cause the world presents itself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>series of puzzles,</v>

11
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:38.480
<v Speaker 1>some of which your capable of solving </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of which you're not.</v>

12
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And you have many puzzles in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that you could solve,</v>

13
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.303
<v Speaker 1>but you choose not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that those are the things that </v>

14
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>weigh on your conscience.</v>

15
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know why I should really do this,</v>

16
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

17
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:50.894
<v Speaker 1>so I had this idea a long time ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the world is a pretty dreadful </v>

18
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:54.051
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

19
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:54.884
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would the world be like if people </v>

20
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.420
<v Speaker 1>stopped avoiding the things they knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should do?</v>

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.833
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the question is how much are we </v>

22
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:02.474
<v Speaker 1>contributing to the fact that life is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an existential catastrophe and a </v>

23
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.234
<v Speaker 1>tragedy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is our own corruption </v>

24
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 1>contributing to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really worthwhile question.</v>

25
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Things you leave undone because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>

26
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>you're resentful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lazy,</v>

27
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:18.074
<v Speaker 1>you have a neuro Shia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you consult your conscience and it </v>

28
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:21.141
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that place over there,</v>

30
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 1>it could use a little work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same as working on yourself.</v>

31
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:27.404
<v Speaker 1>And so you clean that up because he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then things are a little clearer </v>

32
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:31.244
<v Speaker 1>around you and you're a little better </v>
<v Speaker 1>off because you've practiced a bit and </v>

33
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 1>and so your little stronger.</v>

34
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.300
<v Speaker 1>And then something else manifest itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

35
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:41.240
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you could like take a crack </v>
<v Speaker 1>at fixing me up too.</v>

36
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>So he decided to do that and then that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a little bit more pristine,</v>

37
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and soon.</v>

38
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's humble because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceeding your domain of competence.</v>

39
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.033
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

40
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 1>don't be fixing up the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 year old.</v>

41
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Can you even clean up your own room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

42
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should think about that.</v>

43
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>You should think about that because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even clean up your own room,</v>

44
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>who the hell are you to give advice to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world?</v>
