1
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to have fast food workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to have people who work </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit</v>

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 2>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to,</v>

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.150
<v Speaker 2>which Si to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>restructure society.</v>

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.440
<v Speaker 2>So everybody somehow another plays a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part has something to contribute,</v>

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.333
<v Speaker 2>something to share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what a real society is </v>

7
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've given you some coconuts.</v>

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.190
<v Speaker 2>You get me some fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

9
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.250
<v Speaker 2>we make a deal and you do it back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth and left and right,</v>

10
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 2>and when there's nothing to contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you start looking.</v>

11
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.580
<v Speaker 2>The president needs to give us jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need jobs.</v>

12
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.983
<v Speaker 2>So instead of something to contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just find something to do with your </v>

13
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:38.924
<v Speaker 2>time and then it becomes about doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that more than it becomes about finding </v>

14
00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:43.124
<v Speaker 2>something to contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So society gets wrapped around becoming </v>

15
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 2>a part of a machine society instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming a bunch of individuals that are</v>

16
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:51.944
<v Speaker 2>expressing themselves in unique ways and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's sort of borrows and shares </v>

17
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 2>and sells this and you sell that.</v>

18
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 2>And we all sort of figured out how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can contribute in a society.</v>

19
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 2>We got sidetracked and diverted into </v>
<v Speaker 2>these boxes that they call companies and</v>

20
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 2>corporations and we got stuck into these</v>
<v Speaker 2>containers.</v>

21
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.290
<v Speaker 2>They go cubicles or offices and we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got forced into this system,</v>

22
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.124
<v Speaker 2>so our time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of it being invested in making </v>

23
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:16.874
<v Speaker 2>pottery or or fixing cars or doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something where you have a passion or </v>

24
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>you have some sort of a connection to </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of that you've sold your life to</v>

25
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:27.584
<v Speaker 2>sit in a box and work for a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an uncaring machine that demands </v>

26
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 2>productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't understand you.</v>

27
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:34.424
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't want to understand you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a bunch of very strict things in </v>

28
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 2>order to keep the humor at a minimum in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the office,</v>

29
00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:40.604
<v Speaker 2>just in case one fuckheads says some </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid sex jokes that gets him sued and </v>

30
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 2>they have to give somebody a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>

31
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 2>So get it together and this is your life</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

32
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 2>No natural behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's wearing clothes.</v>

33
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:52.934
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to where everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing up and doing something they </v>

34
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:56.470
<v Speaker 2>don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no connection to.</v>

35
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.613
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with our society and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then what's the reward for all this </v>

36
00:02:00.851 --> 00:02:01.510
<v Speaker 2>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go on,</v>

37
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.110
<v Speaker 2>get a big TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go home,</v>

38
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a shiny belt buckle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a nice purse.</v>

39
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:08.060
<v Speaker 2>You're going to wear shoes that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't afford last week.</v>

40
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.103
<v Speaker 2>You got to get that dream car and every </v>
<v Speaker 2>week we're chasing down this new object </v>

41
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 2>and every week trying to fill this hole </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

42
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.823
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sad shadow of a life that we've </v>

43
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:23.150
<v Speaker 2>been left with after work that you work </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight to whatever,</v>

44
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:28.151
<v Speaker 2>the hours a day plus commuting and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll like this and that's your life.</v>

45
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:30.100
<v Speaker 2>That's your real fucking life.</v>

46
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Speaker 2>All that other stuff is not your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

47
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.140
<v Speaker 2>All that other stuff is work and most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us have committed to that.</v>

48
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.320
<v Speaker 2>I know you've been there before and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been there before and we understand that</v>

49
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 2>it's trapped as we got out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the people that are in it,</v>

50
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.790
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times they don't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it's a trap.</v>

51
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 2>They just think it's a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that got dental,</v>

52
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing really good and I got my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>parking spot.</v>

53
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:53.184
<v Speaker 2>It's got my name on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a piece of a heartless shitty </v>

54
00:02:57.711 --> 00:02:59.390
<v Speaker 2>machine that makes money.</v>
