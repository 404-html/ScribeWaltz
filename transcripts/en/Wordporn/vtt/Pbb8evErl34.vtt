00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried really about how much fuzzy </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking is going on in the world.</v>

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Know Fuzzy thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do people just not thinking straight?</v>

3
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Consider this following example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you have a spelling bee.</v>

4
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.110
<v Speaker 1>This is contrived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes the point.</v>

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a spelling bee and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spell the word cat.</v>

6
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one student spells it,</v>

7
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tea person.</v>

8
00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Got It right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next person spells it,</v>

9
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Speaker 1>k a t.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

10
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.390
<v Speaker 1>You got that wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Third Person Spells it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>X Q,</v>

12
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:52.631
<v Speaker 1>w you realize that is marked equally is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with theK ,</v>

13
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.783
<v Speaker 1>a t,</v>

14
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.290
<v Speaker 1>when you could argue that Kat is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter spelling for cat.</v>

15
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Then C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a t,</v>

16
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.370
<v Speaker 1>dictionaries know this because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they spell it phonetically,</v>

17
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.333
<v Speaker 1>and so we've built a system for </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves where there is an answer and </v>

18
00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:16.894
<v Speaker 1>everything else is not the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when some answers are better than </v>

19
00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:21.034
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So our brains are absent the wiring </v>

20
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 1>capable of coming up with an original </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

21
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.530
<v Speaker 1>If you're an employer in two candidates </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up looking for a job,</v>

22
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>and this is again a contrived example </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

23
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and you're interviewing the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates and,</v>

24
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.590
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

25
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.930
<v Speaker 1>it's part of this interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to ask you,</v>

26
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>what's the height of the spire on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>building that we're in?</v>

27
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.161
<v Speaker 1>Candidate says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

28
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

29
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.843
<v Speaker 1>an architect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've majored in architecture for awhile </v>

31
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>and I memorize the heights of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings on campus.</v>

32
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I know the height and inspire is 150 </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

33
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 55 feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

34
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Turns out that's the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the right answer.</v>

35
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>And a person came up with it in second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person goes away,</v>

36
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:13.154
<v Speaker 1>the next candidate walks in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the height of the spire on </v>

37
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>this building?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The candidate says,</v>

38
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll be right back.</v>

39
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.483
<v Speaker 1>Person runs outside measures the length </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the shadow of that spire on the </v>

40
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:33.041
<v Speaker 1>ground measures the length of his or her</v>
<v Speaker 1>own shadow ratios.</v>

41
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>The height to the shadows comes up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a number,</v>

42
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>runs back inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about a 150 feet.</v>

43
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.813
<v Speaker 1>Who are you going to hire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hiring the person who figured it </v>

44
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it took that person longer,</v>

45
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>even though the person's answer is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>as precise.</v>

46
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.973
<v Speaker 1>I'm hiring that person because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person knows how to use the mind in a </v>

47
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:06.571
<v Speaker 1>way not previously engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize when you know how to think,</v>

48
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>it empowers you far beyond those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

49
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Only what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>
