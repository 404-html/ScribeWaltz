1
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of any more human activity</v>

2
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 2>conducting science experiments.</v>

3
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.733
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do as human beings and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that more thoroughly and better than </v>

4
00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:26.920
<v Speaker 1>any other species on earth that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet encountered.</v>

5
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.990
<v Speaker 1>We explore our environment more than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are compelled to utter poetry.</v>

6
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.290
<v Speaker 1>When were toddlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start doing that later.</v>

7
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Before that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every child is assigned.</v>

8
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do kids do?</v>

9
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Young kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids that can barely walk.</v>

10
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.773
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're exploring their environment </v>

11
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.573
<v Speaker 1>through experimentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about your economic </v>

12
00:00:57.971 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what town you're born in,</v>

13
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>what city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what country.</v>

14
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.570
<v Speaker 1>If you're a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are curious about your environment,</v>

15
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.703
<v Speaker 1>your overturning rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're plucking leaves off of trees and </v>

16
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.334
<v Speaker 1>pedals off of flowers and looking inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're doing things that create </v>

17
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>disorder in the lives of the adults </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

18
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>And so then what do adults do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

19
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 1>don't pluck the pedals off the flowers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just spent money on that.</v>

20
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Don't play with the egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might break.</v>

21
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Don't everything is a don't.</v>

22
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.323
<v Speaker 1>I'm often asked by parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what advice can I give them to help get </v>

23
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>kids interested in science?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have only one bit of advice.</v>

24
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Get out of their way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids are born curious period.</v>

25
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.943
<v Speaker 1>We spend the first year of teaching them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to walk and talk and the rest of their </v>

26
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 1>lives tell him to shut up and sit down </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get out of their way.</v>

27
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.480
<v Speaker 1>You know you do and you put things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their myths that help them explore,</v>

28
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 1>help them explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you get a pair of binoculars,</v>

29
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 1>just leave it there one day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch and pick it up and watch them look</v>

30
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll do all kinds of things with it.</v>

31
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at age 11 I had a pair of binoculars and</v>

32
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I looked up to the moon and the moon </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't just bigger,</v>

33
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:15.604
<v Speaker 1>it was better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were mountains and valleys and </v>

34
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:19.720
<v Speaker 1>craters and shadows and it came alive.</v>

35
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I was transformed by picking up a pair </v>
<v Speaker 1>of binoculars looking up.</v>

36
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.490
<v Speaker 1>And so when I think of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of a truly human activity,</v>

37
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>something fundamental to our DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that drives curiosity.</v>

38
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.573
<v Speaker 1>They go together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The act of being curious and the act of </v>

39
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:45.100
<v Speaker 1>wanting to do the experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you conduct science,</v>

40
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.673
<v Speaker 1>it is the natural world that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate decider and what is true and </v>

41
00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:52.324
<v Speaker 1>what is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to create what it is that you </v>

42
00:02:56.201 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>do best that layers onto the formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>training that may be behind it.</v>

43
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I think the greatest of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been in society,</v>

44
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>they were never versions of someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

45
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>They were themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great tragedy,</v>

46
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>people employed in ways that don't fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>tap everything they do best in life.</v>

47
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.593
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the greatest of people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>society carve niches that represented </v>

48
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>the unique expression of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>combinations of talents.</v>

49
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.643
<v Speaker 1>And if everyone had the luxury of </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressing the unique combinations of </v>

50
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:42.244
<v Speaker 1>talents in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our society would be transformed </v>

51
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.393
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>
