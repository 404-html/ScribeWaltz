<v Speaker 1>From this distance vantage point might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see him have any particular </v>

2
00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for us it's different.</v>

3
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Consider again that dot that's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's home.</v>

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>That's us on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone you love,</v>

5
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.130
<v Speaker 1>everyone you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone you ever heard of,</v>

6
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 1>every human being who ever was lived out</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives,</v>

7
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>the aggregate or joy and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of confident religions,</v>

8
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:43.490
<v Speaker 1>ideologies and economic doctrines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every hunter and forager,</v>

9
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.163
<v Speaker 1>every hero and coward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every Creator and destroyer of </v>

10
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every Kenyan peasant,</v>

11
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.740
<v Speaker 1>every young couple in love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every mother and father,</v>

12
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>hopeful child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inventor and explorer.</v>

13
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Every teacher of morals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt politician,</v>

14
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>every superstar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every supreme leader,</v>

15
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.733
<v Speaker 1>every saint and sinner in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our species lived there on the dust </v>

16
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.763
<v Speaker 1>suspended in a sunbeam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earth is a very small stage in a </v>

17
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:22.714
<v Speaker 1>fast cosmic arena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of the rivers of blood spilled by </v>

18
00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:30.244
<v Speaker 1>all those generals and emperors so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in glorious triumph they could become </v>

19
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:39.760
<v Speaker 1>the momentary masters of a fraction of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot.</v>

20
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Think of the endless cruelties visited </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the inhabitants of one corner of this</v>

21
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:50.611
<v Speaker 1>pixel on the scarcely distinguishable </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants of some other corner.</v>

22
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>How frequent their misunderstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how eager they are to kill one another.</v>

23
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>How fervent their hatreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our posturings,</v>

24
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.593
<v Speaker 1>our imagined self importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The delusion that we have some </v>

25
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:12.841
<v Speaker 1>privileged position in the universe are </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged by this point of Pale light.</v>

26
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.353
<v Speaker 1>Our planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a luminary Spec in the great </v>

27
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>enveloping cosmic dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:24.804
<v Speaker 1>are obscurity in all this vastness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no hint that help will come </v>

29
00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:34.780
<v Speaker 1>from elsewhere to save us from </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

30
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 1>The earth is the only world known so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>to harbor life.</v>

31
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>There is nowhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the near future to which our</v>

32
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>species could migrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Visit,</v>

33
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>settle.</v>

34
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Not yet like it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the moment,</v>

35
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.913
<v Speaker 1>the earth is where we make our stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been said that astronomy is a </v>

36
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>humbling and character building </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

37
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>There is perhaps no better demonstration</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the folly of human conceits.</v>

38
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Then this distance image of our tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

39
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.133
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it underscores our responsibility to </v>

40
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:22.051
<v Speaker 1>deal more kindly with one another and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>preserve and cherish the pale blue dot.</v>

41
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>The only home we've ever known him.</v>
