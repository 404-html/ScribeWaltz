00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.453
<v Speaker 1>Somehow part of the package of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>living thinking being is that you get a </v>

2
00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:16.000
<v Speaker 1>universe inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>you get a galaxy sized object inside you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can access.</v>

4
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>And there there are the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rivers,</v>

5
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.720
<v Speaker 1>the jungles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dynastic families,</v>

6
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>the ruins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planets,</v>

7
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>the work sofar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poetry,</v>

8
00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:33.214
<v Speaker 1>the sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magics of millions upon millions </v>

9
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>upon millions of worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is apparently who we each are.</v>

10
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.053
<v Speaker 1>We're a little bit of eternity sticking </v>
<v Speaker 1>into three dimensional space and for </v>

11
00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>some reason occupying time in a monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bondi.</v>

12
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>But when you turn your eyes then inward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you discover the birthright,</v>

13
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.173
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existential tax out of which this </v>

14
00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:08.161
<v Speaker 1>particular existence emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a great secret,</v>

15
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>a great secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the great comfort because it means,</v>

16
00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:14.554
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery didn't die with the fall of our </v>

17
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.280
<v Speaker 1>third or the fall of Atlantis or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall of anything.</v>

18
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Mystery is alive in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the here and now.</v>

19
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.550
<v Speaker 1>It just simply lies on the other side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the barrier of courage.</v>

20
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't even that high of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier.</v>

21
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>It just is a barrier high enough to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the insincere and the misdirected.</v>

22
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.600
<v Speaker 1>But for those who will claim it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>midst of the historic,</v>

23
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

24
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>The late 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become the archaic pioneers.</v>

25
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>They become the first people to carry </v>
<v Speaker 1>the aura borek serpent around to its own</v>

26
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:03.181
<v Speaker 1>tail and to make a closure to the degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>that any one of us has this,</v>

27
00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:05.674
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this connection back to the archaic in </v>

28
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:08.944
<v Speaker 1>our life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes where we have been make a lot </v>

29
00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:17.851
<v Speaker 1>more sense and it makes where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going seem a lot more inviting,</v>

30
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>which it really is.</v>

31
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.603
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
