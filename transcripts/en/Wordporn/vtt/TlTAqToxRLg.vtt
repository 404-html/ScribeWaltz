00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Me Never forget where you come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always,</v>

2
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.250
<v Speaker 1>always pay homage to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always pay homage to it.</v>

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Never stare because then you end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there or you end up back there.</v>

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.880
<v Speaker 1>But just pay respect and be grateful for</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you came from.</v>

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>I show up and walk every single day like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in the position.</v>

7
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:22.124
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I'm not me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the mindset I have and it's </v>

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>woven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's give,</v>

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>it gives inspiration to young kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>young people are anyone any walk of life</v>

10
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>to go and achieve things that are deemed</v>
<v Speaker 1>on thinkable and impossible.</v>

11
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.280
<v Speaker 1>That's such a great thing that I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 1>proud of.</v>

12
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:41.114
<v Speaker 1>So people have dealt with me my hallway </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this has been a bit more </v>

13
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>intensified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doubt and criticism.</v>

14
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just going to relish in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

15
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.990
<v Speaker 1>the aim is to try to prove myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my supporters and my fans and the people</v>

16
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>that were with me prove them correct.</v>

17
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>And then the second aim is to prove that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was wrong.</v>

18
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm in no hurry to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.223
<v Speaker 1>I know my worth and many times have I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said I'm going to do something and I go </v>

20
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be the first time.</v>

21
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It certainly won't be the last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not quite sure what to say about me.</v>

22
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying they're probably just </v>
<v Speaker 1>say I'm A.</v>

23
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.323
<v Speaker 1>I'm a young kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Showed up when he said he was going to </v>

24
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:18.494
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I just know that it will live on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do know.</v>

26
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>I cannot control what people say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>me now or in the future,</v>

27
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.923
<v Speaker 1>but I certainly know what I am doing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that I've done and achieved </v>

28
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>will live on long after I'm gone.</v>
