00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Ms Seven years after my graduation day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had failed on an epic scale,</v>

2
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.913
<v Speaker 1>an exceptionally short lift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marriage had imploded and I was jobless </v>

3
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>alone parent and as poor as it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to be in modern Britain without</v>

4
00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:25.720
<v Speaker 1>being homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fears that my parents had had for me</v>

5
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>and that I had had for myself had both </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to pass and by every usual standard</v>

6
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I was the biggest failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew.</v>

7
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not going to stand here and tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you that failure is fun.</v>

8
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.223
<v Speaker 1>That period of my life was a dark one </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had no idea that there was going </v>

9
00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:45.754
<v Speaker 1>to be what the press has said since </v>
<v Speaker 1>represented as a kind of fairy tale </v>

10
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:50.494
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea then how far the tunnel </v>

11
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:54.964
<v Speaker 1>extended and for a long time any light </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of it was a hope rather than </v>

12
00:00:58.871 --> 00:00:59.704
<v Speaker 1>a reality.</v>

13
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>So why do I talk about the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure?</v>

14
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.843
<v Speaker 1>Simply because failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental stripping away of the </v>

15
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:10.354
<v Speaker 1>inessential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped pretending to myself that I </v>

16
00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:14.494
<v Speaker 1>was anything other than what I was and </v>
<v Speaker 1>began to direct all my energy into </v>

17
00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:19.864
<v Speaker 1>finishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only work that mattered to me had I </v>

18
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:23.464
<v Speaker 1>really succeeded at anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might never have found the </v>

19
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:30.340
<v Speaker 1>determination to succeed in the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>arena where I believed I truly belonged.</v>

20
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.253
<v Speaker 1>I was set free because my greatest fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been realized and I was still alive </v>

21
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.683
<v Speaker 1>and I still had a daughter whom I adored</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had an old typewriter and a big </v>

22
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:43.594
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so rock bottom became the solid </v>

23
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:51.751
<v Speaker 1>foundation on which I rebuilt my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might never fail on the scale I did,</v>

24
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.060
<v Speaker 1>but some failure in life is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is impossible to live without failing</v>

25
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:01.594
<v Speaker 1>at something unless you live so </v>
<v Speaker 1>cautiously that you might as well not </v>

26
00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:08.590
<v Speaker 1>have lived at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case you fail.</v>

27
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.423
<v Speaker 1>By default.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fadia gave me an inner security that I </v>

28
00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 1>have never attained by passing </v>
<v Speaker 1>examinations.</v>

29
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Failure taught me things about myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could have learned no other way.</v>

30
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.573
<v Speaker 1>I discovered that I had a strong will </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more disciplined than I has </v>

31
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:25.434
<v Speaker 1>suspected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also found out that I had friends </v>

32
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 1>whose value was truly above the price of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubis.</v>

33
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.610
<v Speaker 1>The knowledge that you have emerged </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiser and stronger from setbacks.</v>

34
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 1>It means that you are ever after secure </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your ability to survive.</v>

35
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.113
<v Speaker 1>You will never truly know yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the strength of your relationships </v>

36
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 1>until both have been tested by </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversity.</v>

37
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Such knowledge is a true gift for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the titties,</v>

38
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:54.844
<v Speaker 1>painfully one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has been worth more than any </v>

39
00:02:57.311 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>qualification I ever earned.</v>
