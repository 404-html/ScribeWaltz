1
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Merciless but righteous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used that force to tap into the deeper</v>

2
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:12.444
<v Speaker 1>part of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will think I liked the coal too </v>

3
00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

4
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I like a Walmart place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like palm trees.</v>

5
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I respect the cold very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my teacher</v>

6
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>liberation war between heaven and earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I couldn't find it.</v>

7
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.843
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after years I found myself in the park </v>

8
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>in Sunday morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's sleeping and I was pondering</v>

9
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like always pause.</v>

10
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.723
<v Speaker 1>the brain does the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That brain doesn't stop if you really </v>

12
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>search for something and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been founded.</v>

13
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Your brain just keeps on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

14
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.783
<v Speaker 1>your into your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this Sunday morning I was walking </v>

15
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:09.044
<v Speaker 1>through the park and I just felt this </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction to this thin layer of ice on </v>

16
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea came up.</v>

17
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I go into that world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am dressed myself.</v>

18
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 1>When they intimidated water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played a little bit with the.</v>

19
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel the cold whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found power,</v>

20
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>power into power silenced and I came </v>
<v Speaker 1>back avalene game and it's so true.</v>

21
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>A moment I began to become aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading more,</v>

22
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:57.834
<v Speaker 1>deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper and deeper breathing brought </v>

23
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:06.771
<v Speaker 1>about in Oksana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason in my buddy tingling sensation.</v>

24
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I felt this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fall short.</v>

25
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.123
<v Speaker 1>We tap into the deepest part of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain which is pure feeling and it's </v>

26
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.310
<v Speaker 1>great and it hasn't got anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with</v>

27
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.750
<v Speaker 1>after 30 years of mockery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I endured.</v>

28
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.690
<v Speaker 1>It's belief and now it's in the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>university books.</v>

29
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.620
<v Speaker 1>It's all their endocrine systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immune systems,</v>

30
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.240
<v Speaker 1>the chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iceman.</v>

31
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is craziness.</v>

32
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 1>What what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is life about?</v>

33
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>What is the real sense of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot find it in their booth.</v>

34
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 1>You gotta open up</v>

35
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.700
<v Speaker 2>the game to read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be conscious of what you have.</v>
