00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>If you do the three things I tell you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the night,</v>

2
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you whatever it is you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

3
00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>a light you'll be able to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't be able to accomplish whatever</v>

4
00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you want to academically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financially,</v>

5
00:00:19.511 --> 00:00:20.950
<v Speaker 1>relationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.420
<v Speaker 1>So three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you the story and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story is about,</v>

8
00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>you guys have probably heard about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

9
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:28.180
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a young man who,</v>

10
00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:29.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to make a lot of money and so </v>

11
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>he went to this guru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>And he told the Google,</v>

13
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to same level you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Guru said.</v>

14
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:37.570
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be on the same level I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

15
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll meet you tomorrow at the beach at </v>
<v Speaker 1>4:00</v>

16
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the young man got there at 4:00</v>

17
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>AM the old man grabs his hand and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bad do you want to be successful?</v>

18
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.953
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real bad.</v>

19
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.400
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk on out in the water.</v>

20
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.710
<v Speaker 1>So he walks out into the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this.</v>

21
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.840
<v Speaker 1>When he walks up to the water that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>waist deep.</v>

22
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out a little farther.</v>

23
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.383
<v Speaker 1>Walked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for then he had it right around </v>

24
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 1>this area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

25
00:00:58.301 --> 00:00:59.134
<v Speaker 1>come on out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little part that came out a little </v>

26
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>farther.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was right at his mouth.</v>

27
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>My man like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to go back in here.</v>

28
00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:03.844

<v Speaker 1>I thought you said you wanted to be </v>

29
00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:07.660
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

30
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:08.441
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

31
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>walk a little further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can drop this head and held him down.</v>

32
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Hold him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mumia getting scratchy.</v>

33
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.963
<v Speaker 1>Hold him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just before my man was about to pass </v>

34
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he raised him up.</v>

35
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a question for you.</v>

36
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Somebody answered the question for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

37
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 1>when you were underwater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you want to do?</v>

38
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Said I wanted to breathe.</v>

39
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>He told the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

40
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>when you want to succeed as bad as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to breathe,</v>

41
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.353
<v Speaker 1>then you'll be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many y'all got asthma </v>

42
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:37.724
<v Speaker 1>here today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you ever had an asthma attack me </v>

43
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.820
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Short of breath,</v>

44
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740
<v Speaker 1>sob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shortness of breath,</v>

45
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.913
<v Speaker 1>wheezing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you tried to do is get </v>

46
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:47.744
<v Speaker 1>some air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care about no basket ball </v>

47
00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:52.130
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care what's on TV.</v>

48
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't care about nobody calling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care about a party.</v>

49
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.143
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you care about when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to breathe is to get some </v>

50
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 1>fresh air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

51
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.850
<v Speaker 1>And when you get to the point where all </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do is be successful,</v>

52
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>as bad as you want to breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'll be successful.</v>

53
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.073
<v Speaker 1>And I'm here to tell you number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most of you say you want to be </v>

54
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:13.340
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want it bad.</v>

55
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>You just kind of want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want it bad.</v>

56
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.830
<v Speaker 1>And then you want to party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want it as much as you want to</v>

57
00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:19.664
<v Speaker 1>be cool you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of you don't want success as much </v>

58
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:22.544
<v Speaker 1>as you want to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be willing to work off for </v>

59
00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:25.940
<v Speaker 1>three hours of sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours.</v>

60
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some days you will have to stay up three</v>

61
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>days in a row because if you go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep,</v>

62
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.240
<v Speaker 1>you might miss the opportunity to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

63
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>That's how bad you got a warning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 cent was doing this movie.</v>

64
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:38.984
<v Speaker 1>I did a little research on 50 and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that when he wasn't doing the </v>

65
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:42.974
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing the sound track and they </v>

66
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:46.070
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when do you sleep?</v>

67
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>50 sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

68
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:51.080
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleep is for those people who are broke.</v>

69
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.903
<v Speaker 1>I'm asleep and I'm here to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>today if you got somebody came off the </v>

70
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>other day crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

71
00:02:57.711 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't cry to give up.</v>

72
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't cry to quit you already in pain.</v>

73
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>You already hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a reward from it.</v>

74
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Don't go to sleep until you succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing is this.</v>

75
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.910
<v Speaker 1>To be able at any moment to sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you are for,</v>

76
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>what you will become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the number two thing.</v>

77
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>You got to catch that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you,</v>

78
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>you focused into the phone ring and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

79
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>I got an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't answer the phone,</v>

80
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.443
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying to you today that there is </v>

81
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>some of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give up your cell phone,</v>

82
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>you will be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your cell phone is more important to</v>

83
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:39.064
<v Speaker 1>you than your success because the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you spend on your cell phone could be </v>

84
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:43.444
<v Speaker 1>used for your success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time you could be using to be </v>

85
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will use it on the sale and the cell</v>

86
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:50.044
<v Speaker 1>phone is not bringing nothing but a bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able at any moment to sacrifice </v>

87
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>what we are for what we could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do well in math.</v>

88
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>You right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ain't never studied.</v>

89
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good in writing cause you had </v>
<v Speaker 1>never written before,</v>

90
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.153
<v Speaker 1>but I dare you to fail and writing for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole year to see if you can get to the </v>

91
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dare you to fail.</v>

92
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Always want to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dropping.</v>

93
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:15.904
<v Speaker 1>Why are you dropping?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so grateful that the slaves didn't </v>

94
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>drop and quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

95
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a slave.</v>

96
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to be a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a quit.</v>

97
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The slave said,</v>

98
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.343
<v Speaker 1>we will live because one day we will </v>
<v Speaker 1>become and one day our children will be </v>

99
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the slaves would have just said,</v>

100
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>we quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we give up,</v>

101
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 1>we would have died in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>passage,</v>

102
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>but some slaves said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what we go through.</v>

103
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>We going to survive this 400 years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>

104
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>We to get through this and you can't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>through an 1825 the problem is you ain't</v>

105
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 1>never felt no pain before your soft.</v>

106
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a soft generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You quit on everything.</v>

107
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>I people did not quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You quit and you ain't even tried yet.</v>

108
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Last one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

109
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Last one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to me.</v>

110
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Pain is temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may last for a minute or an hour or a</v>

111
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.694
<v Speaker 1>day or even a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually it will subside and </v>

112
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>something else will take its place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I quit,</v>

113
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:15.754
<v Speaker 1>however it will last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was homeless for two and a half </v>

114
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:19.294
<v Speaker 1>years and the problem with most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never felt no pain before y'all </v>

115
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>spoiled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Y'all spoiled.</v>
