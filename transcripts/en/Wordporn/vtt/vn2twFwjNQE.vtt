1
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.273
<v Speaker 1>I think the decision making is a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue of assertiveness is always </v>

2
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:11.034
<v Speaker 1>thinking about assertiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a home serving as he can be with other </v>

3
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:13.794
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be assertive with </v>

4
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:15.984
<v Speaker 1>yourself and make personal decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know of a woman who takes somebody </v>

5
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>else to go shopping with him because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't make a decision as to buy the pink</v>

6
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.150
<v Speaker 1>or the blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.133
<v Speaker 1>Back in my office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a poster that showed a </v>

8
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>dog standing between two fire hydrants </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the caption was decisions,</v>

9
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:37.584
<v Speaker 1>decisions and sometimes the decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are indecisive about hour of no </v>

10
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>greater consequences than what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember in the Shul.</v>

11
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>There was a whole argument at a meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the the short organization about an</v>

12
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:56.424
<v Speaker 1>affair that they were going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they shouldn't have the keyhole </v>

13
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>with sugar or they can't hold without </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>

14
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

15
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>but there are decisions on life that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>much greater than that.</v>

16
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.633
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make the decision as to who you're </v>

17
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>going to marry a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of professional you want,</v>

18
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>what kind of job you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

19
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>As a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to make a decision,</v>

20
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to treat the patient right </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes their decision,</v>

21
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

22
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.480
<v Speaker 1>do we take a chance on surgery?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the risks of surgery?</v>

23
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.743
<v Speaker 1>So there's all levels of decision making</v>
<v Speaker 1>first and we have to realize is we are </v>

24
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>not always going to make the correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>

25
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only God can be right 100 percent of the</v>

26
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:36.564
<v Speaker 1>time I'm going to make wrong decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my decision making has to be a with </v>

27
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:45.940
<v Speaker 1>integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>If I go to think about whether I should </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate on a patient or not,</v>

29
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not because how much I can collect </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the operation,</v>

30
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>but what is the best thing for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>patient?</v>

31
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.893
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to realize that we are,</v>

33
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.750
<v Speaker 1>housed within a physical body that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>desires and it has impulses,</v>

35
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.443
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that they may color our decision </v>

36
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>We may not realize that sometimes we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were bribed,</v>

38
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.423
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the bribe is because we want things </v>

39
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>to turn out a certain way and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the decision.</v>

40
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whAt is really right?</v>

41
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Because we see what is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

42
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>what we want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

43
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great facility rivers who was</v>

45
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:42.441
<v Speaker 1>asked by one of his followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I make good decisions?</v>

46
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>So the rep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

47
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>did you ever watch the type walker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

48
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:48.384
<v Speaker 1>the way a tightrope walker keeps his </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance is that he feels himself pulled </v>

49
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>over to the one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he overcorrect spot leading to the other</v>

50
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

51
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>And that's how he keeps his balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

52
00:02:58.441 --> 00:02:59.274
<v Speaker 1>when you have a desire to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you ought to recognize </v>

53
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>is most of the desires come from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animalistic traits.</v>

54
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.173
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you should do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>think as to why he should not do it </v>

55
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.653
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he leaned over to that side </v>

56
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.210
<v Speaker 1>venue may make a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

57
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.353
<v Speaker 1>I think that we have to have self </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence in our decisions and realize </v>

58
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.743
<v Speaker 1>I am capable of making decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are times when I have to ask </v>

59
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:27.424
<v Speaker 1>expertise that expert advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but given that ultimately the decisions </v>

60
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.614
<v Speaker 1>are mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also have to realize that not </v>

61
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:35.224
<v Speaker 1>making a decision is a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've decided not to make a decision </v>

62
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>and I have to realize that if I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make decisions,</v>

63
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.783
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people aren't going to make them </v>

64
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 1>And the stations that other people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to make for me,</v>

66
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much Worse than this.</v>

67
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>And then the worst decision that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make for myself because,</v>

68
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my,</v>

69
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>my own interest that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

70
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>most people know what's good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

71
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that making decisions means </v>

72
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>getting the best possible information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.513
<v Speaker 1>And having self confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's appropriate to pray for </v>

74
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:14.000
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's for divine guidance and help </v>
<v Speaker 1>me make the right decision.</v>

76
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.470
<v Speaker 1>And then not to be shaken by the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that after we do the best we can,</v>

77
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>that the decision may not work out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way we want.</v>

78
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not to see that a,</v>

79
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>a decision that has poor consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not disease.</v>

80
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:32.914
<v Speaker 1>That as a horrible failure on our part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say our decisions are good or </v>

81
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:41.170
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Determined by how we made them.</v>

82
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Not what the consequences were.</v>
