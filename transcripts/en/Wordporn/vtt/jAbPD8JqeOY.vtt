<v Speaker 1>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sadly,</v>

2
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.820

<v Speaker 1>Every day we hear on the news,</v>

3
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.890
<v Speaker 1>on the radio and television and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers always of war.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of neighbors hurting each other.</v>

<v Speaker 1>other before it's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to stop.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We have to stop the Haiti.</v>

9
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 1>We have to stop living in fear of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own neighbors.</v>

10
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.703
<v Speaker 1>I would like all of you now to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand of the person to the left and to </v>

<v Speaker 1>We can help the world live without fear.</v>

22
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 1>It is our only hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without hope we are lost.</v>
