00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.733
<v Speaker 1>I wonder who might be without my fame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would I be if I said things that </v>

2
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>people didn't want to hear or if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>defied their expectations of me,</v>

3
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.103
<v Speaker 1>what if I showed up to the party without</v>
<v Speaker 1>my Mardi gras back mask and refuse to </v>

4
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:18.124
<v Speaker 1>flash my breasts for him full of beans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a moment to wipe that </v>

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.440
<v Speaker 1>image out of your mind right when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 28,</v>

6
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.440
<v Speaker 1>after a decade as a professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>

7
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.693
<v Speaker 1>I realized one night in La with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose of my life had always been to </v>

8
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:40.030
<v Speaker 1>free people from concern just like my </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>

9
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.530
<v Speaker 1>and when I realized this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dubbed my new devotion,</v>

10
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>the Church of freedom from concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Church of FFC.</v>

11
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dedicated myself to that ministry.</v>

12
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>What's yours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How will you serve the world?</v>

13
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>What do they need that your talent can </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide?</v>

14
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.583
<v Speaker 1>That's all you have to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As someone who's done what you're about </v>

15
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>to go and do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you from experience,</v>

16
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>the effect you have on others is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most valuable currency.</v>

17
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything you gain in life will rot and</v>

18
00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:21.024
<v Speaker 1>fall apart and all that will be left of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you is what was in your heart mind </v>

19
00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>choosing to free people from concern me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the top of a mountain.</v>

20
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Look where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what I get to everywhere I go,</v>

21
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get emotional because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I tapped into this,</v>

22
00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:41.491
<v Speaker 1>it really is extraordinary to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did something that made people present</v>

23
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:44.254
<v Speaker 1>their best selves to meet wherever I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am at the top of the mountain and I </v>

24
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:53.770
<v Speaker 1>was and I the only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only one I hadn't freed was myself,</v>

25
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 1>and that's when my search for identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep.</v>

26
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.370
<v Speaker 1>You can join the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight the wars,</v>

27
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:05.230
<v Speaker 1>play with form all you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to find real peace,</v>

28
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:06.064
<v Speaker 1>you have to let the armor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your need for acceptance can make you </v>

29
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>invisible in this world.</v>

30
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Don't let anything stand in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the light that shines through this form.</v>

31
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.553
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear is going to be a player in your </v>

32
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:22.254
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get to decide how much you can </v>

33
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:25.824
<v Speaker 1>spend your whole life imagining ghosts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about the pathway to the </v>

34
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:29.424
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all there will ever be is what's </v>

35
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>happening here and the decisions we make</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this moment which are based in either</v>

36
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:37.494
<v Speaker 1>love or fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many of us choose our path out of </v>

37
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:45.891
<v Speaker 1>fear disguised as practicality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we really want seems impossibly out</v>

38
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 1>of reach and ridiculous to expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we never dared asked the universe for</v>

39
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:51.664
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I'm the proof that you can </v>

40
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:59.621
<v Speaker 1>ask the universe for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned many great lessons from my not</v>

41
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>the least of which was that you can fail</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what you don't want,</v>

42
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>so you might as well take a chance on </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing what you love.</v>

43
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.320
<v Speaker 1>The thank you.</v>
