1
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Despite what you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two circles are not equal.</v>

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two circles are not equal.</v>

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.980
<v Speaker 1>One is in fact larger than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I need you to do is determine which</v>

4
00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:18.700
<v Speaker 1>one that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so please raise your hand if you believe</v>

5
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:20.260
<v Speaker 1>the blue circle is larger than the red.</v>

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.073
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please raise your hand if you believe </v>

7
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:27.640
<v Speaker 1>the red circle is larger than the blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

8
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

9
00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>before I said anything about these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>circles,</v>

10
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:34.150
<v Speaker 1>what was your first instinct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equal,</v>

11
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:34.984
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they look equal and the reason </v>

12
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:37.360
<v Speaker 1>why they look equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pleasant back.</v>

13
00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.430
<v Speaker 1>They are equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These circles are identical.</v>

14
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.713
<v Speaker 1>Yet I got just about every one of you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise your hand and say that they're </v>

15
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did we learn?</v>

16
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.533
<v Speaker 1>That you can be manipulated like that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in something that goes against </v>

17
00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>your natural instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just just imagine.</v>

18
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.643
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taught that the blue circle is </v>

19
00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>larger than the red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you say it enough times,</v>

20
00:00:58.481 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>you convince yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the truth.</v>

21
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.623
<v Speaker 1>If you're told the lie enough times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes part of your reality and if </v>

22
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:09.220
<v Speaker 1>enough people are taught that lie that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blue circle is larger than the red,</v>

23
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.443
<v Speaker 1>well now it becomes part of the culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that culture then passes that </v>

24
00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:18.541
<v Speaker 1>misinformation along to the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation now become a tradition and we</v>

25
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:20.224
<v Speaker 1>have to remember is that just because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a tradition doesn't mean it's </v>

26
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 1>morally acceptable.</v>

27
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Tradition and morality are not always </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>

28
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.793
<v Speaker 1>so the traditions we have today doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily mean that morally </v>

29
00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:34.870
<v Speaker 1>acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as we evolve as a culture,</v>

30
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>so do our traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the matrix is a story.</v>

31
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a story when told enough times to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough people,</v>

32
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.643
<v Speaker 1>it becomes part of that culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes the tradition and this story </v>

33
00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>is being told over and over every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

34
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 1>if you believe the image on the carton </v>
<v Speaker 1>is where you're getting your milk from,</v>

35
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you're deceiving yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a fantasy.</v>

36
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.463
<v Speaker 1>It only exists in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a blue pill fed to you by the </v>

37
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:04.990
<v Speaker 1>industry to get you to buy their </v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

38
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.273
<v Speaker 1>This is the Matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lie we tell ourselves about where </v>

39
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:12.130
<v Speaker 1>our food is coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is far more disturbing.</v>

40
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Ninety to 95 percent of the milk,</v>

41
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.850
<v Speaker 2>the meat</v>

42
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.403
<v Speaker 1>and the eggs that we consume in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States are coming from these </v>

43
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is called factory farming.</v>

44
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.590
<v Speaker 1>This is what you take thousands of hens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pigs and cows.</v>

45
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.090
<v Speaker 1>You can find them into warehouses is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that every year in the United States,</v>

46
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>10 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 billion cows,</v>

47
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.160
<v Speaker 1>pigs and chickens are being slaughtered </v>
<v Speaker 1>for food.</v>

48
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>So what that works out to be is at every</v>
<v Speaker 1>second in the United States,</v>

49
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 1>300 animals are killed just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 300,</v>

50
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 1>600,</v>
<v Speaker 1>900,</v>

51
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.910
<v Speaker 1>1200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time I'm done talking to the,</v>

52
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.053
<v Speaker 1>it'll be over a million animals that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been slaughtered and most of us </v>

53
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>don't even blink it not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it possible that in United States</v>

54
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.283
<v Speaker 1>of America we can kill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can slot it 300 animals every second </v>

55
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>and not question that because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story we've been told,</v>

56
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>the story justifies the action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you say it enough times,</v>

57
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you actually convince yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the truth.</v>

58
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>How many of you were taught as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to eat meat to get protein.</v>

59
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.803
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you were taught you need to </v>

60
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>drink cow's milk to get strong bones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Dog?</v>

61
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:32.990
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Chimpanzee.</v>

62
00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Elephant Mill.</v>

63
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.111
<v Speaker 1>Not Rhino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milk.</v>

64
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Not Hippo milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Tiger milk.</v>

65
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Not Lion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll not giraffe milk.</v>

66
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Not Elephant Milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I say that already?</v>

67
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>I think you get the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even our own mother's milk,</v>

68
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>but we need to drink cow's milk to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong bones.</v>

69
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.893
<v Speaker 1>The absurdity of drinking the milk from </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other species and any other being </v>

70
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.054
<v Speaker 1>besides her own mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it said enough times loses its </v>

71
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.923
<v Speaker 1>absurdness.</v>
