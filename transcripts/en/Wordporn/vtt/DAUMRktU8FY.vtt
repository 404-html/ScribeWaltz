00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.453
<v Speaker 1>Who saw the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Matrix Matrix was banging movie to </v>

2
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:14.664
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why I appreciated it so </v>

3
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>much was because at the end when Neil </v>
<v Speaker 1>like realize his potential,</v>

4
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>he started to see the binary code.</v>

5
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.520
<v Speaker 1>You remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole world.</v>

6
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.193
<v Speaker 1>That's where I'm trying to be spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to see the word of God and </v>

7
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.720
<v Speaker 1>the whole world's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time that agent throws a punch,</v>

8
00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see you.</v>

9
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just catching this patch of,</v>

10
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't,</v>

11
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not afraid because I'm starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see that,</v>

13
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are just,</v>

14
00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:48.550
<v Speaker 1>situations materialize themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an agent.</v>

15
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.013
<v Speaker 1>Here's the trick is that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that sometimes you can be an </v>

16
00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 1>agent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be an agent for it to yourself.</v>

17
00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.163
<v Speaker 1>You can be an agent against someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not even realize that you're being </v>

18
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:02.920
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

19
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you another thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>matrix.</v>

20
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I was always confused about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that,</v>

21
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Matrix was battling the enemy out </v>

22
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:13.240
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picking them out.</v>

23
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find those enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get that enemy.</v>

24
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Until I realized that until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquered the enemy and yourself,</v>

25
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 1>you can't deal with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to be used by God,</v>

26
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 1>you have to really be used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 1>we always want to be used for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>glorious jobs.</v>

28
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.083
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God put me on a stage in front of the </v>

29
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>people in the grammy show with a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>dress on.</v>

30
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.793
<v Speaker 1>Let me just praise your name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not being used sometimes in </v>

31
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:37.510
<v Speaker 1>order to be used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have to be humiliated.</v>

32
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.693
<v Speaker 1>It's be humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to be kicked and </v>

33
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 1>beaten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that situation,</v>

34
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>the person who was kicking and beating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's feeling more pain than you are.</v>

35
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love is,</v>

36
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:55.840
<v Speaker 1>is an incredible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know love like we should.</v>

37
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 1>We always talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have unconditional love.</v>

38
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Unconditional love is we don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because if a person stops stimulating</v>

39
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:03.580
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stop loving them.</v>

40
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>You're not interesting to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

41
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that real love,</v>

42
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>that love that sometimes it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to have.</v>

43
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 1>That's that love and that's a confidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>builder.</v>

44
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.473
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
