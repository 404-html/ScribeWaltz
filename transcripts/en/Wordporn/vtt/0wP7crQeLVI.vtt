1
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.943
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now really when we go back then to </v>

2
00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:13.061
<v Speaker 1>falling in love and say it's crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling.</v>

3
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't say rising into love,</v>

4
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the fall and uh,</v>

5
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.290
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes back.</v>

6
00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two extremely fundamental things that,</v>

7
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>that is always a curious it at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point between the fall and the creation.</v>

8
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Taking this gosling risk is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition of that being live you see for</v>

9
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:57.521
<v Speaker 1>all life is an act of faith and an act </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gamble.</v>

10
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.733
<v Speaker 1>The moment you take a step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will do so on an act of faith </v>

11
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>because you don't really know that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flaw is not going to give unto your feet</v>

12
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.910
<v Speaker 1>the limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take a journey.</v>

13
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.803
<v Speaker 1>What an act of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment you enter into any kind of </v>

14
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Hulan undertaking in relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an act of faith.</v>

15
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 1>See you've given yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the most powerful thing that</v>

16
00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surrender.</v>

17
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>See I love is an act of surrender to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another person.</v>

18
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Total abandonment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give myself to you,</v>

19
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.873
<v Speaker 1>take me through anything you like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see so that's quite mad because you </v>

20
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>see it's letting things get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

21
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>All sensible people keep things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

22
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it,</v>

23
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Security vigilance,</v>

24
00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.633
<v Speaker 1>watching police watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's watching who's going to watch the </v>

25
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>gods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually,</v>

26
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.511
<v Speaker 1>therefore the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

27
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>the cost of wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is really a sensible,</v>

28
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to let go,</v>

29
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>is to commit oneself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give oneself up.</v>

30
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:16.944
<v Speaker 1>And that's quite mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we come to the strange conclusion </v>

31
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>that in madness lies sanity.</v>
