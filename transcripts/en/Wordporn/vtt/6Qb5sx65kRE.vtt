1
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.940
<v Speaker 1>What makes you itch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of a situation would you like?</v>

2
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.670
<v Speaker 1>That's suppose I do this often in </v>
<v Speaker 1>vocational guidance of students.</v>

3
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.830
<v Speaker 1>They come to me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.163
<v Speaker 1>we're getting out of college and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't the faintest idea what we want </v>

5
00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I always ask the question,</v>

6
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>what would you like to do if money were </v>
<v Speaker 1>no object,</v>

7
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>how would you really enjoy spending your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

8
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so amazing.</v>

9
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>As a result of our kind of educational </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

10
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>crowds of students say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to be painters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to be poets,</v>

12
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to be writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as everybody knows,</v>

13
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>you counted on any money that way or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>passage.</v>

14
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'd like to live an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outdoors life and ride a horses.</v>

15
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>I said he wanted to teach in the riding </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

16
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go through with it.</v>

17
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:02.034
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we finally got down to something </v>

18
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>which the individual says he really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to do,</v>

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>I will say to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that and uh,</v>

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>forget the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

21
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>because if you say that getting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money is the most important,</v>

22
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>you will spend your life completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasting your time.</v>

23
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>You'll be doing things you don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing in order to go on living.</v>

24
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>That is to go on doing things you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like doing,</v>

25
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>which is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better to have a short life that is full</v>

26
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>of what you like doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then a long life in a miserable way.</v>

27
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>And after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do really like what you're doing,</v>

28
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter what what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

29
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.293
<v Speaker 1>eventually they turn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could eventually become a master of </v>

30
00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:54.530
<v Speaker 1>it is the only way to become a master of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that we really with it.</v>

31
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll be able to get a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>fee for whatever it is.</v>

32
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.140
<v Speaker 1>So don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry too much that that's the,</v>

33
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.113
<v Speaker 1>everybody's somebody is interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and anything you can be </v>

34
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will find out as well.</v>

35
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.763
<v Speaker 1>But it's absolutely stupid to spend your</v>
<v Speaker 1>time doing things you don't like in </v>

36
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:16.430
<v Speaker 1>order to go on spending things you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like doing things you got like,</v>

37
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>and to teach her children following the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same track.</v>

38
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.503
<v Speaker 1>What we're doing is we're bringing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>children in educating to live the same </v>

39
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:26.924
<v Speaker 1>sort of lives we are living in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they may justify themselves and </v>

40
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:31.994
<v Speaker 1>find satisfaction in life by bringing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>their children to bring up their </v>

41
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:38.060
<v Speaker 1>children to do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it all rich and no vomit.</v>

42
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.983
<v Speaker 1>It never gets there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so therefore it's so important </v>

43
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>instead of this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I desire?</v>

44
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when my answer that question in a naive </v>

45
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we figured out the vaunted desire.</v>

46
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we want is to control everything</v>

47
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.940
<v Speaker 1>to create girls that don't grow old </v>
<v Speaker 1>apples that don't rot,</v>

48
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.110
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that never wear out conveyances that get</v>

49
00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:17.520
<v Speaker 1>from one place to another instance list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't have to wait power available</v>

50
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:18.354
<v Speaker 1>to do anything that you could conceive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and do it just instantly like that to </v>

51
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.750
<v Speaker 1>get this funny technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>omnipotence.</v>

52
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.463
<v Speaker 1>But if you take time out to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and really go into it with your </v>

53
00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:38.220
<v Speaker 1>full strength of imagination and find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out whether that's where you want it,</v>

54
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.103
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>

55
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.333
<v Speaker 1>you will soon see that's not what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want because the moment you have a </v>

56
00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:55.040
<v Speaker 1>situation where you are really in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of things,</v>

57
00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:59.870
<v Speaker 1>that is to say in which the future is </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost completely predictable.</v>

58
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.830
<v Speaker 1>You will see us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said last night,</v>

59
00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:07.790
<v Speaker 1>that aid completely predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Future is already in the past you've had</v>

60
00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what you want.</v>

61
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.233
<v Speaker 1>You want a surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what that's going to be </v>

62
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>because obviously it wouldn't be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise in the food here.</v>

63
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.033
<v Speaker 1>What a pleasant surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like you to say what sort of a </v>

64
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:25.034
<v Speaker 1>surprise would be pleasant and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really answer that because you know if </v>

65
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>there were to be such things as pleasant</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprises,</v>

66
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>that must also be unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprises must be rude shops.</v>

67
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.640
<v Speaker 1>So you are like somebody's taking a one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those wishing well boxes,</v>

68
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.533
<v Speaker 1>tubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know where you're fishing and you </v>

69
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>bring out a package and you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you've got a dead rat in it or a</v>

70
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:56.971
<v Speaker 1>new camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way that's,</v>

71
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be the thing that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>excites people.</v>

72
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.583
<v Speaker 1>But quite set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there that comes out of this </v>

73
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a feeling of</v>

74
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.330
<v Speaker 1>real disillusionment with the ideal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

75
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

76
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.323
<v Speaker 1>To be in power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in control is not something that </v>

77
00:05:20.391 --> 00:05:25.391
<v Speaker 1>any sense suitable person wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine the situation of big brother</v>

78
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.493
<v Speaker 1>Mr j Edgar Hoover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heinrich Himmler to be glued day at </v>

79
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:43.551
<v Speaker 1>night to a highly descended office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telephone,</v>

80
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.300
<v Speaker 1>television screens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching peaky spine,</v>

81
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.020
<v Speaker 1>everyone in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting all this information together.</v>

82
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.883
<v Speaker 1>Why you could never leave the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that people characterize cause </v>

83
00:05:59.981 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>like they had go hoover's goes home in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evening and uh,</v>

84
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>but when he's back home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.364
<v Speaker 1>there are gods sitting outside the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that hotline telephones going to </v>

86
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always having to be in control.</v>

87
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>And so when you think things through </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

88
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:21.490
<v Speaker 1>you understand that do not want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to control it.</v>

89
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.823
<v Speaker 1>And therefore these Zen Buddhist masters</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I met and others were not super </v>

90
00:06:30.971 --> 00:06:31.804
<v Speaker 1>oncologists and very many westerners who</v>
<v Speaker 1>visited Japan expecting to get a Satori </v>

91
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.170
<v Speaker 1>as a result of which they would know </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and control everything,</v>

92
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Speaker 1>but grievously disappointed and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not much in the south.</v>
