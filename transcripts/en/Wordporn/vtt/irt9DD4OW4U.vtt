1
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.283
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually always found something to </v>

2
00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:07.694
<v Speaker 1>be very true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is most people don't get those </v>

3
00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:11.924
<v Speaker 1>experiences because they never ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never found anybody that didn't </v>

4
00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>want to help me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I asked him for help,</v>

5
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I always call him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called up,</v>

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.243
<v Speaker 1>this will date me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I called up Bill Hewlett when I was </v>

7
00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:24.674
<v Speaker 1>12 years old and he lived in Palo Alto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was number was still on the phone book </v>

8
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.420
<v Speaker 1>and he answered the phone himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Steve Jobs.</v>

10
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:34.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm 12 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a student in high school and I want</v>

11
00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:35.204
<v Speaker 1>to build a frequency counter and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering if you had any spare parts I </v>

12
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:39.014
<v Speaker 1>could have and he laughed and he gave me</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spare parts to build this frequency </v>

13
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 1>counter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any gave me a job.</v>

14
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:46.070
<v Speaker 1>That summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look Packard working on the assembly</v>

15
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:46.904
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting nuts and bolts together on </v>

16
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>frequency counters.</v>

17
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.963
<v Speaker 1>He got me a job in a place that </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and I was in heaven and I've </v>

18
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>never found anyone who said no or hung </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the phone when I call.</v>

19
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.710
<v Speaker 1>I just asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when people ask me,</v>

20
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:02.770
<v Speaker 1>I try to be as responsive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to pay that,</v>

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>that debt of gratitude back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>most people never pick up the phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>call,</v>

23
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:09.854
<v Speaker 1>and most people never ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what separates sometimes the </v>

24
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.710
<v Speaker 1>people to do things from the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just dream about them.</v>

25
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Gotta be you gotta Act and you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be willing to fail.</v>

26
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be willing to crash and </v>
<v Speaker 1>burn,</v>

27
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people on the phone with starting a</v>

28
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:27.920
<v Speaker 1>company with whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're afraid of failing,</v>

29
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.383
<v Speaker 1>you won't get very far.</v>
