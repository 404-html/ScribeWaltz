1
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.600
<v Speaker 1>You take a drink with your friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody says,</v>

2
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should go skydiving tomorrow,</v>

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:12.380
<v Speaker 1>we'll go skydiving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or yes,</v>

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>so then that night you're laying in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bed and you just keep.</v>

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.963
<v Speaker 1>You're terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep imagining over and over again </v>

7
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>jumping out of an airplane and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out why you would do that and you</v>

8
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>laying there and you have the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>night's sleep of your life.</v>

9
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.463
<v Speaker 1>You wake up the next day and you go down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you said where you were going to </v>

10
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:34.734
<v Speaker 1>meet and everybody's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get in a van and you don't know </v>

11
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:39.444
<v Speaker 1>that your friends had the same night </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had because they're pretended </v>

12
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:42.481
<v Speaker 1>like they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

13
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:43.314
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my uncle is a navy seal and you know </v>

14
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to this.</v>

15
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

16
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your stomach is terrible.</v>

17
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:52.464
<v Speaker 1>You can't eat and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to be the only one </v>

18
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.973
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't jump out of this airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get there and then you have the </v>

19
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:00.544
<v Speaker 1>safety brief and you're standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guys will tell you what the </v>

20
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>chute doesn't open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen is you're doing,</v>

21
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you want help with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you fly and you go up,</v>

22
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>you go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go up and you go up to 14,000</v>

23
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.654
<v Speaker 1>feet and you notice there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A light is red and it's yellow and </v>

24
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>green,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>So right now the light's red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you start thinking,</v>

26
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>at some point the light's going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>green.</v>

27
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

28
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.103
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you wait and negotiate yellow and </v>

29
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>the light goes green and somebody opens </v>
<v Speaker 1>the door.</v>

30
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.593
<v Speaker 1>And in that moment you realize you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>never been in a freaking airplane with </v>

31
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:34.224
<v Speaker 1>the door open.</v>

32
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>And you go and the guy walks you up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the thing and you're standing</v>

33
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:45.831
<v Speaker 1>and your toes are on the edge and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking out down to death.</v>

34
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

35
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say one,</v>

36
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he pushes you on to.</v>

37
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:58.131
<v Speaker 1>Because people grab on three and you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you fall out of the airplane.</v>

38
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.533
<v Speaker 1>And in one second you realize that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most blissful experience of your </v>

39
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your flying right,</v>

40
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel like falling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:13.404
<v Speaker 1>It's like you actually are kind of held </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit by the wind and then you </v>

42
00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>start and you start falling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're falling and you.</v>

43
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.543
<v Speaker 1>There's zero fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize that the point of maximum </v>

44
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:29.181
<v Speaker 1>danger is the point of minimum fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bless,</v>

45
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.043
<v Speaker 1>bless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're flying and you're doing that </v>

46
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>and then 20 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 seconds,</v>

47
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>40 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have enough time to just kind of</v>

48
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

49
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.920
<v Speaker 1>That's that building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

50
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.753
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

51
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.993
<v Speaker 1>And the lesson for me was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why were you scared in your bed the </v>

52
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>night before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you.</v>

53
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>What do you need that fear for bundling </v>
<v Speaker 1>you scared in your bed.</v>

54
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen hours before you jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you scared in the car?</v>

55
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Why could you not enjoy breakfast with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

56
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.533
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you need to fear is fear of </v>

57
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:12.574
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're nowhere even near to the </v>

58
00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything up to the stepping out.</v>

59
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.400
<v Speaker 1>There's actually no reason to be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only just ruins your day,</v>

60
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to jump,</v>

61
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.643
<v Speaker 1>and then in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden where you should be </v>

62
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>terrified is the most blissful </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of your life,</v>

63
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.310
<v Speaker 1>and God placed the best things in life </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of terror,</v>

64
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of your maximum fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the best things in life.</v>
