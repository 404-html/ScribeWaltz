1
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.153
<v Speaker 1>People are starving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may not know it because they're </v>

2
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>being fed mass produced garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the packaging,</v>

3
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:10.644
<v Speaker 1>it's colorful and it's loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's being produced in the same </v>

4
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>factories that make pop tarts and ipads </v>
<v Speaker 1>by people sitting around thinking,</v>

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.623
<v Speaker 1>what can we do to get people to buy more</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these and they're very good at their </v>

6
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:22.344
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it is you're getting </v>

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.713
<v Speaker 1>because that's what they're making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're selling you something and the </v>

8
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>world is built on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now politics and government are built on</v>

9
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corporations are built on this.</v>

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.943
<v Speaker 1>Interpersonal relationships are built on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and we're starving all of us and </v>

11
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:40.404
<v Speaker 1>we're killing each other and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting each other and we're calling </v>

12
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.124
<v Speaker 1>each other liars and evil because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all become marketing and we want to win </v>

13
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>because we're lonely and empty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared and we're led to believe.</v>

14
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Winning will change all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is no winning.</v>

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>What can be done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say who you are,</v>

16
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>really say it in your life and in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

17
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Tell someone out there who has lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone not yet born.</v>

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.773
<v Speaker 1>Someone who won't be born for 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're writing will be a record of your </v>

19
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.420
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't help but be,</v>

20
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're honest about who you are,</v>

21
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.943
<v Speaker 1>you'll help that person be less lonely </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their word because that person will </v>

22
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>recognize him or herself in you and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will give them hope and it's done so for</v>

23
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>me and I have to keep rediscovering it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's profound importance in my life.</v>

24
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Give that to the world rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling something to the world.</v>

25
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.523
<v Speaker 1>Don't allow yourself to be tricked into </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that the way things are is the </v>

26
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>way the world must work and that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

27
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>selling is what everyone must do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try not to the world needs you.</v>

28
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.263
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need you at a party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having read a book about how to appear </v>

29
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:49.254
<v Speaker 1>smart at parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These books exist and they're </v>

30
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:52.614
<v Speaker 1>attempting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but resist falling into that trap world </v>

31
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>needs you at the party starting real </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations saying,</v>

32
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being kind.</v>
