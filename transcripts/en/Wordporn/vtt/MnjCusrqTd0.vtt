00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I hated that job and I clung to that job</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years in a place without heat,</v>

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.700
<v Speaker 1>six years at a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt stuck in.</v>

3
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I was afraid of change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>When I was 29,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told myself the next acting job I get,</v>

5
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.590
<v Speaker 1>no matter what it pays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will from now on,</v>

6
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>for better or worse be a working actor </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

7
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have either the internet or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cellphone or a job,</v>

8
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.503
<v Speaker 1>but something good happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a loping theater job in a play </v>

9
00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:46.381
<v Speaker 1>called imperfect love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which led to a film called 13 moons with</v>

10
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:51.961
<v Speaker 1>the same writer which led to other roles</v>
<v Speaker 1>which led to other roles and I've worked</v>

11
00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:57.991
<v Speaker 1>as an actor ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that would happen at 29,</v>

12
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>walking away from data processing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified,</v>

13
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.630
<v Speaker 1>but this made me very hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally</v>

14
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.343
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I tell this story because the world </v>

15
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are not allowed to yet.</v>

16
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.393
<v Speaker 1>Please don't even bother asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't bother telling the world you </v>

17
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>already show it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>

18
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhythm sets in.</v>

19
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Just try not to wait until like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your 29 before you find it,</v>

20
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.770
<v Speaker 1>and if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine too.</v>

21
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Some of us never find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will.</v>

22
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I promise you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise the rest of your life to meet you.</v>

23
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Don't search for defining moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they will never come.</v>

24
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.163
<v Speaker 1>The moments that define you have already</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and they will already happen </v>

25
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.903
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't wait until they tell you you are </v>

26
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get in there.</v>

27
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I waited a long time out in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>before I gave myself permission to fail.</v>

28
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.240
<v Speaker 1>What did becky say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever tried,</v>

29
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 1>ever failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter.</v>

30
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Try again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fail again.</v>

31
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Fail better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is yours.</v>

32
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Treat everyone kindly and light up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

33
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.960
