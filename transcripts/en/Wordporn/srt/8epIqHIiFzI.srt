1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:08,530
Despite what you might be thinking,
these two circles are not equal.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,840
I repeat.
These two circles are not equal.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,980
One is in fact larger than the other.
What I need you to do is determine which

4
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:18,700
one that is,
so please raise your hand if you believe

5
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:20,260
the blue circle is larger than the red.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,073
All right,
please raise your hand if you believe 

7
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:27,640
the red circle is larger than the blue.
Right?

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,870
Very good.
Now,

9
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:30,760
before I said anything about these two 
circles,

10
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:34,150
what was your first instinct?
Equal,

11
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:34,984
right?
Because they look equal and the reason 

12
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,360
why they look equal,
it's pleasant back.

13
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,430
They are equal.
These circles are identical.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,713
Yet I got just about every one of you to
raise your hand and say that they're 

15
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:44,680
not.
So what did we learn?

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,533
That you can be manipulated like that to
believe in something that goes against 

17
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:52,570
your natural instincts.
Just just imagine.

18
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,643
Just imagine as a child,
you're taught that the blue circle is 

19
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:58,480
larger than the red.
If you say it enough times,

20
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:00,040
you convince yourself.
That's the truth.

21
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,623
If you're told the lie enough times,
it becomes part of your reality and if 

22
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:09,220
enough people are taught that lie that 
the blue circle is larger than the red,

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,443
well now it becomes part of the culture 
and if that culture then passes that 

24
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:18,541
misinformation along to the next 
generation now become a tradition and we

25
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:20,224
have to remember is that just because we
have a tradition doesn't mean it's 

26
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:24,250
morally acceptable.

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,630
Tradition and morality are not always 
the same,

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,793
so the traditions we have today doesn't 
necessarily mean that morally 

29
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:34,870
acceptable,
and as we evolve as a culture,

30
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,240
so do our traditions.
Now the matrix is a story.

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,390
It's a story when told enough times to 
enough people,

32
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,643
it becomes part of that culture.
It becomes the tradition and this story 

33
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:52,060
is being told over and over every day.
In fact,

34
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,660
if you believe the image on the carton 
is where you're getting your milk from,

35
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,600
you're deceiving yourself.
This is a fantasy.

36
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,463
It only exists in your head.
It's a blue pill fed to you by the 

37
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:04,990
industry to get you to buy their 
product.

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,273
This is the Matrix,
the lie we tell ourselves about where 

39
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:12,130
our food is coming from.
The reality is far more disturbing.

40
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,790
Ninety to 95 percent of the milk,

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,850
the meat

42
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,403
and the eggs that we consume in the 
United States are coming from these 

43
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:25,550
conditions,
and this is called factory farming.

44
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,590
This is what you take thousands of hens,
pigs and cows.

45
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,090
You can find them into warehouses is 
that every year in the United States,

46
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,870
10 billion,
10 billion cows,

47
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,160
pigs and chickens are being slaughtered 
for food.

48
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,310
So what that works out to be is at every
second in the United States,

49
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,290
300 animals are killed just like that.
So 300,

50
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,240
600,
900,

51
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,910
1200.
By the time I'm done talking to the,

52
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,053
it'll be over a million animals that 
have been slaughtered and most of us 

53
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:04,450
don't even blink it not.
How is it possible that in United States

54
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,283
of America we can kill?
We can slot it 300 animals every second 

55
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,310
and not question that because of the 
story we've been told,

56
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,560
the story justifies the action.
If you say it enough times,

57
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,510
you actually convince yourself.
That's the truth.

58
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,110
How many of you were taught as a child,
you need to eat meat to get protein.

59
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,803
I knew I was.
How many of you were taught you need to 

60
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:31,090
drink cow's milk to get strong bones?
Not Dog?

61
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,990
No.
Not Chimpanzee.

62
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:34,240
Email.
Not Elephant Mill.

63
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,111
Not Rhino.
Milk.

64
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,240
Not Hippo milk.
Not Tiger milk.

65
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:39,220
Not Lion.
They'll not giraffe milk.

66
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,990
Not Elephant Milk.
Did I say that already?

67
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,090
I think you get the point.
Not even our own mother's milk,

68
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,700
but we need to drink cow's milk to get 
strong bones.

69
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,893
The absurdity of drinking the milk from 
any other species and any other being 

70
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,054
besides her own mother.
When it said enough times loses its 

71
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,923
absurdness.
