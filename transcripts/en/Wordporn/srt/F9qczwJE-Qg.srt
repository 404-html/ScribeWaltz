1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,143
Not An inspirational speaker.
I've never lost a limb on a 

2
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:09,320
mountainside,
metaphorically or otherwise,

3
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:11,600
and I'm certainly not here to give 
career advice because,

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,913
well,
I've never really had what most would 

5
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:16,100
consider a job.
However,

6
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:16,934
I have had large groups of people 
listening to what I say for quite a few 

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,910
years now and it's given me an inflated 
sense of self importance.

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,200
So I will now at the ripe old age of 
37.9

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,590
bestow upon you nine life lessons.
One,

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,693
you don't have to have a dream.
Americans on talent shows always talk 

11
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:35,900
about their dreams.
Fine.

12
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:37,940
If you have something you've always 
wanted to do,

13
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:39,260
dreamed of,
like in your heart,

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,880
go for it.
After all,

15
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:43,220
it's something to do with your time 
chasing a dream.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,293
And if it's a big enough one,
it'll take you most of your life to 

17
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:47,144
achieve.
So by the time you get to it and are 

18
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:52,310
staring into the abyss of the 
meaninglessness of your achievement,

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,230
you'll be almost dead.
So it won't matter.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,200
Okay?

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,033
I never really had one of those dreams 
and so I advocate passionate dedication 

22
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:04,660
to the pursuit of short term goals.
Be Micro ambitious.

23
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:07,900
Put your head down and work with pride 
on whatever is in front of you.

24
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,900
You never know where you might end up.
Just be aware.

25
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:14,260
The next worthy pursuit will probably 
appear in your periphery,

26
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,020
which is why you should be careful of 
longterm dreams.

27
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,003
If you focus too far in front of you,
you won't see the shiny thing out the 

28
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:22,540
corner of your eye.
Two,

29
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,500
don't seek happiness.
Happiness is like an orgasm.

30
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,440
If you think about it too much,
it goes away.

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:37,580
Okay?
Keep

32
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,413
busy and aim to make someone else happy 
and you might find you get some as a 

33
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:41,594
side effect.
We didn't evolve to be constantly 

34
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:43,934
content.
Contented homo erectus got eaten before 

35
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:48,770
passing on their genes.
Three,

36
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,350
remember,
it's all luck.

37
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,320
You are lucky to be here.
You are incalculably.

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,273
Incalculably lucky to be born.
Understanding that you can't truly take 

39
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,624
credit for your successes nor truly 
blame others for their failures will 

40
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:04,910
humble you and make you more 
compassionate.

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,313
Empathy is intuitive,
but is also something you can work on 

42
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:10,910
intellectually.
Four,

43
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,730
exercise.
I'm sorry,

44
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:14,564
you pasty Pale smoking philosophy grads 
actually in your eyebrows into a 

45
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,004
cartesian curve.
As you watch the human movement mob 

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,830
winding their way through the miniature 
traffic cones of their existence,

47
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,950
you are wrong and they are right.
Well,

48
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:29,750
you're half right.
You think therefore you are,

49
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,580
but also you jog,
therefore you sleep.

50
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,340
Therefore you're not overwhelmed by 
existential angst.

51
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,270
You can't be Kant and you don't want to 
be play a sport,

52
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:39,470
do yoga,
pump iron,

53
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:40,041
run,
whatever,

54
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,590
but take care of your body.
You're going to need it.

55
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,160
Most of you mob are going to live to 
nearly a hundred and even the poorest of

56
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:49,250
you will achieve a level of wealth that 
most humans throughout history could not

57
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:50,084
have dreamed of and this long luxurious 
life ahead of you is going to make you 

58
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,220
depressed.
Five,

59
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,054
be hard on your opinions.
A famous bon mot asserts that opinions 

60
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:06,070
are like assholes and that everyone has 
one.

61
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,893
There is great wisdom in this,
but I would add that opinions differ 

62
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,684
significantly from assholes in that 
yours should be constantly and 

63
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,020
thoroughly examined.

64
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,583
Okay?

65
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,910
We must think critically and not just 
about the ideas of others.

66
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:25,744
Be Hard on your beliefs.
Take them out onto the veranda and hit 

67
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,910
them with a cricket bat.
Be intellectually rigorous.

68
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,370
Identify your biases,
your prejudices,

69
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,204
your privileges.
Most of society's arguments are kept 

70
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,940
alive by a failure to acknowledge 
nuance.

71
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,073
We tend to generate false dichotomies 
and then try to argue one point using 

72
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:44,944
two entirely different sets of 
assumptions like two tennis players 

73
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,594
trying to win a match by hitting 
beautifully executed shots from either 

74
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:57,151
end of separate tennis courts.
Six be a teacher please,

75
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:59,500
please,
please be a teacher.

76
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,560
Teachers are the most admirable and 
important people in the world.

77
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:05,590
You don't have to do it forever,
but if you're in doubt about what to do,

78
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:09,160
be an amazing teacher.
Even if you're not a teacher,

79
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,370
be a teacher.
Share your ideas.

80
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,380
Don't take for granted your education.

81
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,380
Rejoice in what you learn and spray it.
Seven,

82
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,913
define yourself by what you love.
I found myself doing this thing a bit 

83
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:27,340
recently where if someone asks me what 
sort of music I like,

84
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:27,791
I say,
well,

85
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,624
I don't listen to the radio because pop 
song lyrics and Nymi or if someone asks 

86
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:31,924
me what food I like I say,
I think truffle oil is overused and 

87
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:34,984
slightly obnoxious and I see it all the 
time online people whose idea of being 

88
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:39,664
part of a subculture is to hate coldplay
or football or feminists or the Liberal 

89
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,763
Party.
We have a tendency to define ourselves 

90
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:48,850
in opposition to stuff.
As a comedian,

91
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:52,750
I make my living out of it,
but try to also express your passion for

92
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,584
things you love.
Be Demonstrative and generous in your 

93
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:56,494
praise of those you admire.
Send thank you cards and give standing 

94
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,970
ovations.
Be Pro stuff,

95
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:01,804
not just anti stuff.
Eight respect people with less power 

96
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:07,024
than you.
I have in the past made important 

97
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,830
decisions about people.
I work with agents and producers,

98
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:12,664
big decisions based largely on how they 
treat the wait staff in the restaurants 

99
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:19,330
we're having the meeting in.
I don't care if you're the most powerful

100
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,164
cat in the room.
I will judge you on how you treat the 

101
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:26,680
least powerful.
So there nine,

102
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,390
finally,
don't rush.

103
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,570
You don't need to already know what 
you're going to do with the rest of your

104
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:33,130
life.
Don't panic.

105
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,780
You will soon be dead.

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:36,870
Okay?

107
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,020
Life will sometimes seem long and tough 
and God,

108
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:44,190
it's tiring and you will sometimes be 
happy and sometimes sad,

109
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,650
and then you'll be old and then you'll 
be dead.

110
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,623
There is only one sensible thing to do 
with this empty existence and that is 

111
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,840
fill it,
not fill it,

112
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,973
fill it.
Life is best filled by learning as much 

113
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,270
as you can about as much as you can,
taking pride in whatever you're doing,

114
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:04,160
having compassion,
sharing ideas,

115
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,550
running,
being enthusiastic.

116
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,780
And then there's love and travel and 
wine and sex and art and kids and giving

117
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:14,720
and mountain climbing.
But you know that stuff already.

118
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,530
It's an incredibly exciting thing.
This one meaningless life of yours.

119
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,720
Good luck and thank you for indulging 
me.
