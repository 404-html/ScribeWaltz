1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,223
Ideas where nothing with that an idea.
So I say that a desire for an idea is 

2
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,124
like a bait on a hook and you're 
desiring an idea and you have to have 

3
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:23,834
patients just like you do in fishing.
How deep that hook goes depends on the 

4
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:33,770
size of that ball of consciousness and 
designer.

5
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,790
Another word for it is like focus,
just focus on some and it's a little bit

6
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:43,320
like daydreaming spots come and Fox 
common stocks come and meet me.

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,700
Boom.
An idea of condoms that is so thrilling.

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,340
You've caught a little purple fish with 
red fins and and little little dancing,

9
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,410
speckled eyes and this little fish could
be just a fragment,

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,750
but you love this fragment.
You love this fish and that idea,

11
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:11,120
you write it down so you won't forget 
it.

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,733
Then now that you have that fish even 
more powerful bait and soon others will 

13
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:19,394
swim in and join to it and the thing 
will start emerging and it goes like 

14
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:26,480
that for me anyway,
fragments,

15
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,823
but it's all ideas coming,
ideas that I've fallen in love with and 

16
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,770
I'm an a fallen in love with different 
ideas.

17
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,320
Then you will,
but there's billions,

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,140
trillions of ideas coming,
ideas for everything.

19
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,510
So that's how it,
that's how it goes.

20
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:46,511
Then you get the ideas organized and 
then you translate those ideas and along

21
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:51,530
the way you stay open because the thing 
isn't finished til it's finished.

22
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,480
There can be happy accidents.
You say,

23
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,110
how did I get so lucky to get this 
thing?

24
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,360
I thought this was complete,
but this is beyond the beyond fitting in

25
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:03,194
here and jumping it.
Stay on your toes and don't walk away 

26
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:12,131
from any element until it feels correct 
because it's built out of many,

27
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:14,420
many,
many elements.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,300
Stay true to the idea all along the 
road,

29
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:20,000
and then you have some hope of the whole
working.
