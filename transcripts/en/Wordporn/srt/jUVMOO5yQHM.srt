1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,050
I can't think of any more human activity

2
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,020
conducting science experiments.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,733
That's what we do as human beings and we
do that more thoroughly and better than 

4
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:26,920
any other species on earth that we have 
yet encountered.

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,990
We explore our environment more than we 
are compelled to utter poetry.

6
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,290
When were toddlers,
we start doing that later.

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,530
Before that happens,
every child is assigned.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,620
I think about it.
What do kids do?

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,850
Young kids,
kids that can barely walk.

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,773
What are they doing?
They're exploring their environment 

11
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,573
through experimentation.
I don't care about your economic 

12
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:00,250
background.
I don't care what town you're born in,

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,540
what city,
what country.

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,570
If you're a child,
you are curious about your environment,

15
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,703
your overturning rocks.
You're plucking leaves off of trees and 

16
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,334
pedals off of flowers and looking inside
and you're doing things that create 

17
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:16,750
disorder in the lives of the adults 
around you.

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,600
And so then what do adults do?
They say,

19
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,840
don't pluck the pedals off the flowers.
I just spent money on that.

20
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,120
Don't play with the egg.
It might break.

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,490
Don't everything is a don't.

22
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,323
I'm often asked by parents,
what advice can I give them to help get 

23
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:39,160
kids interested in science?
And I have only one bit of advice.

24
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,190
Get out of their way.
Kids are born curious period.

25
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,943
We spend the first year of teaching them
to walk and talk and the rest of their 

26
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:54,730
lives tell him to shut up and sit down 
so you get out of their way.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,480
You know you do and you put things in 
their myths that help them explore,

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,620
help them explore.
Once you get a pair of binoculars,

29
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,210
just leave it there one day.
Watch and pick it up and watch them look

30
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,220
around.
They'll do all kinds of things with it.

31
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,280
For me,
at age 11 I had a pair of binoculars and

32
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,770
I looked up to the moon and the moon 
wasn't just bigger,

33
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:15,604
it was better.
There were mountains and valleys and 

34
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,720
craters and shadows and it came alive.

35
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,350
I was transformed by picking up a pair 
of binoculars looking up.

36
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,490
And so when I think of science,
I think of a truly human activity,

37
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,480
something fundamental to our DNA,
something that drives curiosity.

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,573
They go together.
The act of being curious and the act of 

39
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:45,100
wanting to do the experiment.
When you conduct science,

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,673
it is the natural world that is the 
ultimate decider and what is true and 

41
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:52,324
what is not.
You have to create what it is that you 

42
00:02:56,201 --> 00:03:01,120
do best that layers onto the formal 
training that may be behind it.

43
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,710
I think the greatest of people that have
ever been in society,

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,970
they were never versions of someone 
else.

45
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,490
They were themselves.
The great tragedy,

46
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,340
people employed in ways that don't fully
tap everything they do best in life.

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,593
And so I think the greatest of people in
society carve niches that represented 

48
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,430
the unique expression of their 
combinations of talents.

49
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,643
And if everyone had the luxury of 
expressing the unique combinations of 

50
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:42,244
talents in this world,
our society would be transformed 

51
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,393
overnight.
