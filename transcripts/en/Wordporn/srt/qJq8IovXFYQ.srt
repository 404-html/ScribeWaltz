1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,233
It's something I want to tell you about 
the stress and how we have to look at 

2
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,130
stress.
Okay.

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,240
And I think it's an important thing 
because many people have told me from my

4
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:20,340
lectures is the one thing they remember.
Okay.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,230
I was it in a dentist office and looked 
at an article that said,

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,590
how do lobsters grow?
I don't care how lobsters grow,

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,590
but I was interested.
And it points out that a students,

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,453
a soft,
mushy animal that lives inside of the 

9
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:41,370
rigid shell,
that rigid shell does not expand.

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,020
Well.
How can the lobster grow?

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,510
Well,
as the lobster grows,

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,403
that shell becomes very confining and 
the kind of the lobster feels itself 

13
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:50,544
under pressure and uncomfortable.
It goes under a rock formation to 

14
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:58,050
protect itself from predatory fish casts
off Michelle and produces a new one.

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,813
Well,
eventually that Shell becomes very 

16
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,094
uncomfortable as it grows in the red 
back under the rocks and the lobster 

17
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:06,534
repeats this numerous times.
The stimulus for the lobster to be able 

18
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:15,021
to grow is that it feels uncomfortable 
right now.

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,450
If lobsters had doctors,
they would never grow.

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,520
Because as soon as the lobster feels 
uncomfortable,

21
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:22,260
goes to the doctor,
gets a valium,

22
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:24,030
gets a percocet,
feels fine,

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,163
never kept off his shell.
So I think that we have to realize is 

24
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:28,734
that we have to realize that times of 
stress are also times that are signals 

25
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:35,430
for growth.
And if we use adversity properly,

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,690
we can grow through adversity.
