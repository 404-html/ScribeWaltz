1
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,020
So much better than your performing 
under pressure,

2
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,060
whether it's me or anybody else is the 
same.

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,313
You know,
I have the same pressures as anyone 

4
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:21,910
else.
There's time,

5
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:23,350
there's performance,
there's financial.

6
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:24,700
I mean,
you know,

7
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:27,160
there's deadlines.
My pressures are not unique.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,800
Everybody has the same kinds of 
pressures.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,810
Um,
but what I found,

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,620
what I find fascinating is the 
interpretation of the stimuli.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,050
Let me explain.
So I was watching the Olympics this last

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,883
summer leopards,
and I was amazed at how bad the 

13
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:46,480
questions were that the reporters would 
ask all the athletes,

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,573
and almost always they asked the same 
question whether they were about to 

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,540
compete or after they competed.
Where are you nervous?

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,270
Right?
And to a t,

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,900
all the athletes went no.
Right?

18
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,500
And what I realized is it's not that 
they're not nervous,

19
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:07,450
it's their interpretation of what's 
happening in their bodies.

20
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:07,870
I mean,
what is,

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,440
what happens when you're nervous,
right?

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,460
Your heart rate starts to go,
you're,

23
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,910
you know,
you sort of get a little tense.

24
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:14,080
You get a little sweaty,
right?

25
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,060
You have the expectation of what's 
coming.

26
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,640
And we interpreted that as I'm nervous 
now.

27
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:21,730
What's the interpretation of excited?
Your heart rate starts to go.

28
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:23,920
You become,
you're anticipating what's coming,

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,720
right?
You get a little sort of like tense.

30
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:26,554
It's all the same thing.
It's the same stimuli except these 

31
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:29,350
athletes,
these,

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,513
these Olympic quality athletes have 
learned to interpret the stimuli that 

33
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:36,430
the rest of us would say as nervous,
as excited.

34
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:37,480
They all said the same thing.
No,

35
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,460
I'm not nervous.
I'm excited.

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,073
And so I've actually practiced it just 
to tell myself when I start to get 

37
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:46,900
nervous that this is excitement,
you know?

38
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,070
And so we're,
when you,

39
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,860
I used to speak in front of a large 
audience and somebody would say,

40
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,990
how do you feel?
He's saying little nervous.

41
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,940
Now when somebody says,
how do you feel?

42
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm like,
really excited actually.

43
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,053
And it,
it came from just sort of telling 

44
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:00,880
myself,
no,

45
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:01,480
no,
no,

46
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,290
this is excitement and it becomes a 
little bit automatic later on.

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,553
Um,
but it's kind of a remarkable thing to 

48
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:08,704
deal with pressure by interpreting what 
your body is experiencing as excitement 

49
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:14,670
rather than nerves.
And it's really kind of effective.

50
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,513
It makes you want them to rush forward 
rather than pull back and yet it's the 

51
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:18,274
same experience.
