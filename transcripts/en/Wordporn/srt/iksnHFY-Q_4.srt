1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:09,040
She said to me once,
I wish he would just kill yourself.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,670
You're such a burden to me.
He said,

3
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:13,504
I think I was nine when my mom drove me 
down to the deepest part of Baja 

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,070
California and she walks me up to an 
orphanage and she knocks on the door and

5
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:25,750
the guy comes to the door and she says,
I found this kid,

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,193
and she left me there for 90 days until 
my grandmother could get out of her 

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,380
where she had dumped me and my 
grandmother came and rescued me.

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,883
My mom beat me every single day of my 
elementary school years with things you 

9
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,100
could imagine in a lot of things you 
couldn't.

10
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,660
Every day my back was bloodied and 
scarred.

11
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,680
In fact,
I had to wear three tee shirts to school

12
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,560
each day,
first tee shirt,

13
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:02,490
because the blood would seep through 
second tee shirt.

14
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:05,640
You could still see it.
Finally,

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,503
the third tee shirt,
you couldn't see any blood kids at 

16
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:12,530
school.
They'd make fun of me a fool.

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,170
It's 100 degrees.
Why are you wearing three tee shirts?

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,310
And then he stopped speaking so 
overwhelmed with emotion,

19
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,403
and he seemed to be staring at a piece 
of his story that only he could see 

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,600
whether he could regain his speech.
She said through his tears,

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,293
I wore three tee shirts well into my 
adult years because I was ashamed of my 

22
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:47,280
wounds.
I didn't want anybody to see him.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,840
But now I welcome by roads.
I run my fingers over my scars.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
My woes are my friends.
After all,

25
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:10,230
how can I help heal the wounded if I 
don't welcome my own wounds in awe,

26
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,063
came upon everyone.
The measure of our compassion lies not 

27
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,843
in our service of those on the margins,
but only in our willingness to see 

28
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:36,924
ourselves in kinship with them.
And indeed you have to brace yourselves 

29
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:45,651
because people will accuse you of 
wasting your time and you stand with the

30
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:47,850
poor and the powerless and the 
voiceless.

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,433
You stand with those whose dignity has 
been denied and you stand with those 

32
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:56,220
whose burdens are more than they can 
bear.

33
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,960
And you will go from here and have this 
exquisite privilege once in a while,

34
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:06,090
to be able to stand with the easily 
despised and the readily left out

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,680
with the demonized so that the 
demonizing will stop a gentle,

36
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:15,614
kind soul.
He's proof that only the soul that 

37
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:25,031
ventilator to the world with tenderness 
has any chance of changing the world.
