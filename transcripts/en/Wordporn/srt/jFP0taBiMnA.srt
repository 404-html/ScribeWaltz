1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,153
People are starving,
they may not know it because they're 

2
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:09,810
being fed mass produced garbage,
the packaging,

3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:10,644
it's colorful and it's loud,
but it's being produced in the same 

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,460
factories that make pop tarts and ipads 
by people sitting around thinking,

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,623
what can we do to get people to buy more
of these and they're very good at their 

6
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:22,344
jobs,
but that's what it is you're getting 

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,713
because that's what they're making.
They're selling you something and the 

8
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:31,830
world is built on this.
Now politics and government are built on

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,780
this.
Corporations are built on this.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,943
Interpersonal relationships are built on
this and we're starving all of us and 

11
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:40,404
we're killing each other and we're 
hitting each other and we're calling 

12
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,124
each other liars and evil because it's 
all become marketing and we want to win 

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,150
because we're lonely and empty and 
scared and we're led to believe.

14
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,970
Winning will change all that,
but there is no winning.

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,600
What can be done?
Say who you are,

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,720
really say it in your life and in your 
work.

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,160
Tell someone out there who has lost 
someone not yet born.

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,773
Someone who won't be born for 500 years.
You're writing will be a record of your 

19
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,420
time.
It can't help but be,

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,180
but more importantly,
if you're honest about who you are,

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:16,943
you'll help that person be less lonely 
in their word because that person will 

22
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:24,780
recognize him or herself in you and that
will give them hope and it's done so for

23
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:28,950
me and I have to keep rediscovering it.
It's profound importance in my life.

24
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,330
Give that to the world rather than 
selling something to the world.

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,523
Don't allow yourself to be tricked into 
thinking that the way things are is the 

26
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:39,870
way the world must work and that in the 
end,

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,550
selling is what everyone must do.
Try not to the world needs you.

28
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,263
It doesn't need you at a party.
Having read a book about how to appear 

29
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,254
smart at parties.
These books exist and they're 

30
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:52,614
attempting,
but resist falling into that trap world 

31
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,950
needs you at the party starting real 
conversations saying,

32
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,360
I don't know,
being kind.
