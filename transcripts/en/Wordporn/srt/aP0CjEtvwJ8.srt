1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,720
Merciless but righteous,
I used that force to tap into the deeper

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,444
part of myself.
People will think I liked the coal too 

3
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:20,170
much.
I don't like it.

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,970
I like a Walmart place.
I like palm trees.

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,350
I respect the cold very much.
It's my teacher

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:36,130
liberation war between heaven and earth.
But I couldn't find it.

7
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:37,843
And uh,
after years I found myself in the park 

8
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,270
in Sunday morning,
everybody's sleeping and I was pondering

9
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,750
once again,
like always pause.

10
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,990
It doesn't stop,
you know,

11
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,723
the brain does the brain.
That brain doesn't stop if you really 

12
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,440
search for something and yeah,
I've been founded.

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,270
Your brain just keeps on you,
your,

14
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:04,783
your into your mind.
So this Sunday morning I was walking 

15
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:09,044
through the park and I just felt this 
attraction to this thin layer of ice on 

16
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,720
the water.
The idea came up.

17
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,160
I go into that world.
I am dressed myself.

18
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,930
When they intimidated water,
I played a little bit with the.

19
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,870
I didn't feel the cold whatsoever.
I found power,

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
power into power silenced and I came 
back avalene game and it's so true.

21
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,580
A moment I began to become aware.
I was reading more,

22
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:57,834
deeper,
deeper and deeper breathing brought 

23
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:06,771
about in Oksana,
Jason in my buddy tingling sensation.

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,250
I felt this is it.
I fall short.

25
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,123
We tap into the deepest part of our 
brain which is pure feeling and it's 

26
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,310
great and it hasn't got anything to do 
with

27
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,750
after 30 years of mockery,
which I endured.

28
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,690
It's belief and now it's in the American
university books.

29
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,620
It's all their endocrine systems,
immune systems,

30
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,240
the chapter,
the iceman.

31
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,450
Nobody could say,
what you do is craziness.

32
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,180
What what?
What is life about?

33
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,040
What is the real sense of.
You cannot find it in their booth.

34
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,970
You gotta open up

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,700
the game to read,
to be conscious of what you have.
