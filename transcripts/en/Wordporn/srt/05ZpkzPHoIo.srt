1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,790
If you do the three things I tell you to
do the night,

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,780
I guarantee you whatever it is you want 
to do,

3
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:17,110
a light you'll be able to do,
you won't be able to accomplish whatever

4
00:00:17,111 --> 00:00:19,510
you want to academically,
financially,

5
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:20,950
relationally,
whatever.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,420
So three things.
All right,

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,190
I'm going to tell you the story and the 
story is about,

8
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,050
you guys have probably heard about this 
before.

9
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:28,180
It was a,
it was a young man who,

10
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:29,014
you know,
he wanted to make a lot of money and so 

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,660
he went to this guru,
right?

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,270
And he told the Google,
you know,

13
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:35,710
I want to be able to same level you are.
That's what the Guru said.

14
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,570
If you want to be on the same level I'm 
on,

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,900
I'll meet you tomorrow at the beach at 
4:00

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,970
AM.
So the young man got there at 4:00

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,970
AM the old man grabs his hand and said,
how bad do you want to be successful?

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,953
He said,
real bad.

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,400
He said,
walk on out in the water.

20
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,710
So he walks out into the water,
watch this.

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,840
When he walks up to the water that goes 
waist deep.

22
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,460
So he said,
come out a little farther.

23
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,383
Walked out,
look for then he had it right around 

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,300
this area.
Said,

25
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:59,134
come on out.
A little part that came out a little 

26
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:01,270
farther.
It was right at his mouth.

27
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,010
My man like,
I'm about to go back in here.

28
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:03,844
This God is mine for the old man said,
I thought you said you wanted to be 

29
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:07,660
successful.
He said,

30
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:08,441
I do.
He said,

31
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:11,830
walk a little further.
He can drop this head and held him down.

32
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,080
Hold him down.
Mumia getting scratchy.

33
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:14,963
Hold him down.
Just before my man was about to pass 

34
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:18,100
out,
he raised him up.

35
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,520
He said,
I got a question for you.

36
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,630
Somebody answered the question for me.
He said,

37
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:24,940
when you were underwater,
what did you want to do?

38
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,230
Said I wanted to breathe.

39
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,830
He told the guy,
he said,

40
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,370
when you want to succeed as bad as you 
want to breathe,

41
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,353
then you'll be successful.
I don't know how many y'all got asthma 

42
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:37,724
here today,
but if you ever had an asthma attack me 

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,820
for you.
Short of breath,

44
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,740
sob,
shortness of breath,

45
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,913
wheezing.
The only thing you tried to do is get 

46
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:47,744
some air.
You don't care about no basket ball 

47
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:52,130
game.
You don't care what's on TV.

48
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,130
You don't care about nobody calling you.
You don't care about a party.

49
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,143
The only thing you care about when 
you're trying to breathe is to get some 

50
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,110
fresh air.
That's it.

51
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,850
And when you get to the point where all 
you want to do is be successful,

52
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,700
as bad as you want to breathe,
then you'll be successful.

53
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,073
And I'm here to tell you number one,
that most of you say you want to be 

54
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:13,340
successful,
but you don't want it bad.

55
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,220
You just kind of want it.
You don't want it bad.

56
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,830
And then you want to party.
You don't want it as much as you want to

57
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:19,664
be cool you,
most of you don't want success as much 

58
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:22,544
as you want to sleep.
You gotta be willing to work off for 

59
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:25,940
three hours of sleep,
two hours.

60
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,390
If you really want to be successful,
some days you will have to stay up three

61
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:32,480
days in a row because if you go to 
sleep,

62
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,240
you might miss the opportunity to be 
successful.

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,150
That's how bad you got a warning.
50 cent was doing this movie.

64
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:38,984
I did a little research on 50 and 50 
said that when he wasn't doing the 

65
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:42,974
movie,
he was doing the sound track and they 

66
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:46,070
said,
when do you sleep?

67
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:47,750
50 sleep?
He says,

68
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,080
sleep.
Sleep is for those people who are broke.

69
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,903
I'm asleep and I'm here to tell you 
today if you got somebody came off the 

70
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,710
other day crying,
I said,

71
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,120
look,
don't cry to give up.

72
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,620
Keep going.
Don't cry to quit you already in pain.

73
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,240
You already hurt.
Get a reward from it.

74
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,280
Don't go to sleep until you succeed.
The most important thing is this.

75
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,910
To be able at any moment to sacrifice 
what you are for,

76
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:21,940
what you will become.
That's the number two thing.

77
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,560
You got to catch that one.
Some of you,

78
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,510
you focused into the phone ring and then
you're like,

79
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,550
I got an answer.
If I don't answer the phone,

80
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,443
I'm going to die.
I'm saying to you today that there is 

81
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:33,670
some of you,
if you give up your cell phone,

82
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,230
you will be successful,
but your cell phone is more important to

83
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:39,064
you than your success because the time 
you spend on your cell phone could be 

84
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,444
used for your success,
the time you could be using to be 

85
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:49,210
successful,
you will use it on the sale and the cell

86
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:50,044
phone is not bringing nothing but a bill
to be able at any moment to sacrifice 

87
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,240
what we are for what we could be.
I don't do well in math.

88
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,340
You right.
You ain't never studied.

89
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,640
I'm not good in writing cause you had 
never written before,

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,153
but I dare you to fail and writing for a
whole year to see if you can get to the 

91
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,450
end.
I dare you to fail.

92
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,070
Always want to give up.
I'm dropping.

93
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:15,904
Why are you dropping?
I'm so grateful that the slaves didn't 

94
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:19,840
drop and quit.
Say,

95
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,550
I'm just going to stop.
I'm a slave.

96
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,650
I'm just going to be a slave.
I'm a quit.

97
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,330
Listen to me.
The slave said,

98
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,343
we will live because one day we will 
become and one day our children will be 

99
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,660
free.
If the slaves would have just said,

100
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,220
we quit,
we give up,

101
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,550
we would have died in the middle 
passage,

102
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,310
but some slaves said,
I don't care what we go through.

103
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,700
We going to survive this 400 years of 
slavery.

104
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,290
We to get through this and you can't get
through an 1825 the problem is you ain't

105
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,480
never felt no pain before your soft.

106
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,410
It's a soft generation.
You quit on everything.

107
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,730
I people did not quit.
You quit and you ain't even tried yet.

108
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,630
Last one,
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,490
Last one.
Listen to me.

110
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Pain is temporary.
It may last for a minute or an hour or a

111
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,694
day or even a year,
but eventually it will subside and 

112
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,920
something else will take its place.
If I quit,

113
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:15,754
however it will last forever.
But I was homeless for two and a half 

114
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,294
years and the problem with most of you,
you never felt no pain before y'all 

115
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:24,340
spoiled.
Y'all spoiled.

116
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,810
Some of y'all spoiled,
just bottom line.

117
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,550
Your parents had done everything for 
you.

118
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,350
You never had to do nothing for 
yourself.

119
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,790
You're spoiled.
Are we gonna keep it real tonight?

120
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,870
Some of you are spoiled brats.
Every time you ever got in trouble,

121
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,704
somebody in your house got you out of,
and some of you have never learned to 

122
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:38,944
grow up.

123
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,500
And so every time something gets hard,
you quit.

124
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,380
You called Momma,
I dare you to take a little pain.

125
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,760
I dare you.
I dare you not to go home.

126
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,430
Somebody said I got him go home.
I feel bad.

127
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,303
Go throw it.
You Ain't going to die at the end of 

128
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:56,824
pain and success,
you're not going to adopt because you 

129
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:00,440
fill in a little bit.
Hey,

130
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,110
you have to give it everything.
You've got.

131
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,090
No more TV,
no more parties,

132
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,190
no more player.
If you will have a 4.0

133
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,190
what you need to be doing is study.
Get off the phone.

134
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,953
I'm sorry,
I'm not available until the end of this 

135
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,780
year.
I'm about to get busy.

136
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:15,790
Nah,
what?

137
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,653
I'm exactly where I wanted to be because
I realize I've got to commit my very 

138
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:22,970
being to this thing.
I gotta I gotta breathe it.

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,833
I got it,
eat it,

140
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,970
sleep it,
and until you get there,

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,940
you'll never be successful in life.
But once you get there,

142
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:31,100
I guarantee you the world is yours.
