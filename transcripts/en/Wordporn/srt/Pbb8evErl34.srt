1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,250
I'm worried really about how much fuzzy 
thinking is going on in the world.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,820
Know Fuzzy thinking.
Do people just not thinking straight?

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,420
Consider this following example.
Imagine you have a spelling bee.

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,110
This is contrived,
but it makes the point.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,520
There's a spelling bee and you have to 
spell the word cat.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,090
Okay,
so one student spells it,

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,910
c,
a tea person.

8
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:35,810
Got It right.
The next person spells it,

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,730
k a t.
that's wrong.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,390
You got that wrong.
Okay.

11
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,630
Third Person Spells it.
X Q,

12
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:52,631
w you realize that is marked equally is 
wrong with theK ,

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,783
a t,

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,290
when you could argue that Kat is a 
bitter spelling for cat.

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,820
Then C,
a t,

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,370
dictionaries know this because that's 
how they spell it phonetically,

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,333
and so we've built a system for 
ourselves where there is an answer and 

18
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:16,894
everything else is not the answer.
Even when some answers are better than 

19
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:21,034
others.
So our brains are absent the wiring 

20
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,510
capable of coming up with an original 
thought.

21
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,530
If you're an employer in two candidates 
come up looking for a job,

22
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,060
and this is again a contrived example 
and,

23
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,730
and you're interviewing the two 
candidates and,

24
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,590
and you say,
oh,

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,930
it's part of this interview.
I just want to ask you,

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,060
what's the height of the spire on this 
building that we're in?

27
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,161
Candidate says,
oh,

28
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,230
I was,
I was just,

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,460
I was a,
uh,

30
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,843
an architect.
I've majored in architecture for awhile 

31
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,470
and I memorize the heights of all the 
buildings on campus.

32
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,940
I know the height and inspire is 150 
feet.

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,330
One hundred 55 feet tall.
Okay?

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,420
Turns out that's the right answer.
That's the right answer.

35
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:12,320
And a person came up with it in second.
That person goes away,

36
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,154
the next candidate walks in.
Do you know the height of the spire on 

37
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:18,680
this building?
The candidate says,

38
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,230
no,
but I'll be right back.

39
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,483
Person runs outside measures the length 
of the shadow of that spire on the 

40
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:33,041
ground measures the length of his or her
own shadow ratios.

41
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:37,100
The height to the shadows comes up with 
a number,

42
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,370
runs back inside.
It's about a 150 feet.

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,813
Who are you going to hire?
I'm hiring the person who figured it 

44
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,940
out,
even though it took that person longer,

45
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,360
even though the person's answer is not 
as precise.

46
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,973
I'm hiring that person because that 
person knows how to use the mind in a 

47
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:06,571
way not previously engaged.
You realize when you know how to think,

48
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,130
it empowers you far beyond those.
No.

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,320
Only what?
Two things.
