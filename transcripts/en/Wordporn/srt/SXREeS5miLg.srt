1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:09,370
I have to make notes because a lot of my
inspiration comes from meeting people or

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,943
going outside of the country or going 
around a corner and tomorrow 

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,420
neighborhood and talking to a five year 
old little boy.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,310
It's mainly kids,
man.

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:23,740
I always say this kids bugging me out 
because they have no fear,

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,140
nothing.
My little niece,

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,320
she's two years old,
but she's fierce,

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:35,200
nothing and she has no concept of 
reality as we know it.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,810
That always inspired me to write for 
some reason,

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,900
man,
it gives me a moment.

11
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:46,100
Talking to them gives me a moment to 
step back and look at the world for what

12
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:51,101
I know this case is that always tripped 
me out cause I told them about the story

13
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:59,030
when I seen him when I was eight,
nine years old with two on Rosecrans.

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:01,923
We're shooting a video of my 
neighborhood in Compton when two blocks 

15
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:07,790
down and got me.
By the time we got me,

16
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,840
everybody was out there.
It was like pandemonium.

17
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,650
He put me on his shoulders and that it 
was Dr Dre and um,

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,531
two part,
right.

19
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:16,364
Then fast forward 15 years later,
I'm in the studio world and I'm telling 

20
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,514
him that story.
I was one of the kids out there as much 

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,210
as he remembers him.
Crazy,

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,150
crazy to me,
which just me being an ultimate fan,

23
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:29,984
I'm still a fan to this day,
but to actually sit down and have 

24
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,153
conversations beyond the music,
he wasn't just a figment of my 

25
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:38,810
imagination.
I was watching on TV screen.

26
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,483
The people are watch.
They just didn't get there on a pure 

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,673
luck.
They actually worked hard and they are 

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,620
human beings.
We're real emotion,

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,500
real dry,
real consistency,

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,513
real hunger.

31
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,583
You know,
deep down we're all kids at heart and I 

32
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,120
know I am.
I'm the biggest kid,

33
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,583
you know,
so I can be able to relate and 

34
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:03,434
communicate them,
communicate with them in a way that I 

35
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:06,944
watch.
Most adults can't sit there and hold a 

36
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:10,530
conversation,
you know,

37
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,510
and go back to the studio man,
or write them most bugged out song,

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,150
you know,
just because it just gave me,

39
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:17,984
like I said,
it gives me a chance to sit back and 

40
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:20,534
allow myself and look at the 
perspectives of the different spectrum 

41
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,920
of having responsibilities and not 
having any at all.

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,953
And I have to remember these things.
I have to write them down and then five 

43
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:37,634
or three months later,
I have to find that same emotion that I 

44
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:45,161
felt when I was inspired by definite 
process.

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,760
It's working process.
