1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,940
What makes you itch?
What sort of a situation would you like?

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,670
That's suppose I do this often in 
vocational guidance of students.

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,830
They come to me and say,
well,

4
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,163
we're getting out of college and we 
haven't the faintest idea what we want 

5
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:29,270
to do.
So I always ask the question,

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,040
what would you like to do if money were 
no object,

7
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,170
how would you really enjoy spending your
life?

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,320
Wow.
It's so amazing.

9
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:42,600
As a result of our kind of educational 
system,

10
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,010
crowds of students say,
well,

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,830
we'd like to be painters.
We'd like to be poets,

12
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:48,810
we'd like to be writers.
But as everybody knows,

13
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:51,600
you counted on any money that way or not
passage.

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,260
This is what I'd like to live an 
outdoors life and ride a horses.

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,270
I said he wanted to teach in the riding 
school.

16
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,200
Uh,
let's go through with it.

17
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:02,034
What do you want to do?
When we finally got down to something 

18
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:06,930
which the individual says he really 
wants to do,

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,680
I will say to him,
you do that and uh,

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,950
forget the money.
Uh,

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,870
because if you say that getting the 
money is the most important,

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,120
you will spend your life completely 
wasting your time.

23
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,080
You'll be doing things you don't like 
doing in order to go on living.

24
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,210
That is to go on doing things you don't 
like doing,

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,720
which is stupid.
Better to have a short life that is full

26
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:40,010
of what you like doing.
Then a long life in a miserable way.

27
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,660
And after all,
if you do really like what you're doing,

28
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:48,450
it doesn't matter what what it is,
you can't,

29
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,293
eventually they turn it.
You could eventually become a master of 

30
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:54,530
it is the only way to become a master of
something that we really with it.

31
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,490
And then you'll be able to get a good 
fee for whatever it is.

32
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,140
So don't,
don't worry too much that that's the,

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,113
everybody's somebody is interested in 
everything and anything you can be 

34
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,110
interested in,
you will find out as well.

35
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,763
But it's absolutely stupid to spend your
time doing things you don't like in 

36
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:16,430
order to go on spending things you don't
like doing things you got like,

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,400
and to teach her children following the 
same track.

38
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,503
What we're doing is we're bringing up 
children in educating to live the same 

39
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:26,924
sort of lives we are living in order 
that they may justify themselves and 

40
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:31,994
find satisfaction in life by bringing up
their children to bring up their 

41
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:38,060
children to do the same thing.
So it all rich and no vomit.

42
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,983
It never gets there.
And so therefore it's so important 

43
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,160
instead of this question,
what do I desire?

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,353
Well,
when my answer that question in a naive 

45
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:57,620
way,
we figured out the vaunted desire.

46
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,820
Uh,
what we want is to control everything

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,940
to create girls that don't grow old 
apples that don't rot,

48
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,110
close,
that never wear out conveyances that get

49
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:17,520
from one place to another instance list.
So we don't have to wait power available

50
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:18,354
to do anything that you could conceive 
and do it just instantly like that to 

51
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,750
get this funny technological 
omnipotence.

52
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,463
But if you take time out to think about 
that and really go into it with your 

53
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:38,220
full strength of imagination and find 
out whether that's where you want it,

54
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,103
b,

55
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,333
you will soon see that's not what you 
want because the moment you have a 

56
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:55,040
situation where you are really in 
control of things,

57
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:59,870
that is to say in which the future is 
almost completely predictable.

58
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,830
You will see us.
As I said last night,

59
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:07,790
that aid completely predictable.
Future is already in the past you've had

60
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,470
it.
That's not what you want.

61
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,233
You want a surprise.
You don't know what that's going to be 

62
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,460
because obviously it wouldn't be a 
surprise in the food here.

63
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,033
What a pleasant surprise.
I'd like you to say what sort of a 

64
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:25,034
surprise would be pleasant and you can't
really answer that because you know if 

65
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:35,350
there were to be such things as pleasant
surprises,

66
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,470
that must also be unpleasant.
Surprises must be rude shops.

67
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,640
So you are like somebody's taking a one 
of those wishing well boxes,

68
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,533
tubs,
you know where you're fishing and you 

69
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,970
bring out a package and you don't know 
whether you've got a dead rat in it or a

70
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:56,971
new camera.
That's the way that's,

71
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,210
that seems to be the thing that really 
excites people.

72
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,583
But quite set.
And there that comes out of this 

73
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,970
inquiry,
a feeling of

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,330
real disillusionment with the ideal of 
power.

75
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,490
Yeah.

76
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,323
To be in power,
to be in control is not something that 

77
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:25,391
any sense suitable person wants.
You imagine the situation of big brother

78
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,493
Mr j Edgar Hoover,
Heinrich Himmler to be glued day at 

79
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:43,551
night to a highly descended office,
telephone,

80
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,300
television screens,
watching peaky spine,

81
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,020
everyone in anything.
Getting all this information together.

82
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,883
Why you could never leave the office.
I mean that people characterize cause 

83
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:03,380
like they had go hoover's goes home in 
the evening and uh,

84
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,530
but when he's back home,
you know,

85
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,364
there are gods sitting outside the door.
Does that hotline telephones going to 

86
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:14,690
something?
He's always having to be in control.

87
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,090
And so when you think things through 
like that,

88
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:21,490
you understand that do not want,
don't want to control it.

89
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:23,823
And therefore these Zen Buddhist masters
that I met and others were not super 

90
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:31,804
oncologists and very many westerners who
visited Japan expecting to get a Satori 

91
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,170
as a result of which they would know 
everything and control everything,

92
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,920
but grievously disappointed and said,
there's not much in the south.
