1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,353
When no one listens to you,
we feel that once they see to all sorts 

2
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:10,190
of things start to happen,
for instance,

3
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:11,024
you have so much pain inside yourself 
that you try and hurt yourself on the 

4
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:15,344
outside because you want help,
but it's the wrong help you're asking 

5
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:18,704
for.
People see it as crying wolf or 

6
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:23,270
attention seeking and they think because
you're in the media all the time,

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,190
you've got enough attention,
inverted commerce.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,713
But I was actually crying out.
I wanted to get better in order to go 

9
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:32,810
forward and continue my duty and my role
as a wife,

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,250
mother,
Princess of Wales.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,190
So I,
uh,

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,960
yes,
I did influx for myself.

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,453
I didn't like myself.
I was ashamed because I couldn't cope 

14
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:44,840
with the pressures.
What did you actually do?

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Well,
I just taught my arms my next and I work

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,983
in environments now where I see women 
doing similar things and I'm able to 

17
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,690
understand completely where they're 
coming from.

18
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,843
I think every strong woman in history 
has had to walk down a similar path and 

19
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:05,200
I think it's the strength that causes 
the confusion,

20
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,270
the fear.
Why is she strong?

21
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,080
Where does she get it from?
Where she lives?

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,053
She going to use it.
I'd like to be a queen of people's 

23
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:19,260
hearts and people's hearts and I don't 
see myself being queen,

24
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,293
just country.
I don't think many people would want me 

25
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:22,910
to be queen.
Actually,

26
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,860
when I say many people,
I mean established time,

27
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:31,090
married into because they've decided to 
Salta.

28
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,603
Why do you think they've decided?
Because I do things differently because 

29
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:41,460
I didn't go by when we book because 
neutral,

30
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,570
the whole not the head and that's got me
into trouble in my work.

31
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,590
I understand that and show it.
