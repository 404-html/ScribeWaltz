1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,400
You want to change the world,
you start from yourself and work outward

2
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:09,200
because you build your competence that 
way.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,303
So like I don't know how you can go out 
and protest the structure of the entire 

4
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:15,410
economic system if can't keep your room 
organized.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,590
People try to change the outside world 
for lots of ways,

6
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:21,380
but many of those ways aren't just pure 
good.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,663
And so what I've thought about is that,
well what you start to do is you start 

8
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:26,084
to tail and act out the truth locally,
like within the domain of your actual 

9
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:31,730
competence.
You know,

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,970
cause the world presents itself as a 
series of puzzles,

11
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:38,480
some of which your capable of solving 
and some of which you're not.

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,440
And you have many puzzles in front of 
you that you could solve,

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,303
but you choose not to.
You know that those are the things that 

14
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:46,940
weigh on your conscience.

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,620
It's like,
you know why I should really do this,

16
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:50,060
but you don't.
It's like,

17
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:50,894
so I had this idea a long time ago 
because the world is a pretty dreadful 

18
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:54,051
place.
I thought,

19
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:54,884
well,
what would the world be like if people 

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,420
stopped avoiding the things they knew 
they should do?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,833
You know?
Because the question is how much are we 

22
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:02,474
contributing to the fact that life is a,
is an existential catastrophe and a 

23
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,234
tragedy?
How much is our own corruption 

24
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:12,740
contributing to that?
That's a really worthwhile question.

25
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,980
Things you leave undone because you're 
angry,

26
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:17,240
you're resentful,
you're lazy,

27
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,074
you have a neuro Shia,
well you consult your conscience and it 

28
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:21,141
says,
well,

29
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:22,800
you know,
that place over there,

30
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:26,570
it could use a little work.
It's the same as working on yourself.

31
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:27,404
And so you clean that up because he can 
and then things are a little clearer 

32
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:31,244
around you and you're a little better 
off because you've practiced a bit and 

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,080
and so your little stronger.

34
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,300
And then something else manifest itself 
and says,

35
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:41,240
well maybe you could like take a crack 
at fixing me up too.

36
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,540
So he decided to do that and then that 
gets a little bit more pristine,

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,010
you know,
and soon.

38
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,480
And it's humble because you're not 
exceeding your domain of competence.

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,033
You know,
it's like,

40
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,740
don't be fixing up the economy.
18 year old.

41
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,320
Can you even clean up your own room?
No.

42
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,290
Well,
you should think about that.

43
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,090
You should think about that because if 
you can't even clean up your own room,

44
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,610
who the hell are you to give advice to 
the world?
