1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:06,973
Anger around,
privately held with a lot of us go 

2
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:14,190
around feeling quite enraged,
angry,

3
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:17,370
privately about the way that I love 
lives have gone.

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,620
My task today is to turn that into 
sadness.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,300
If we,
if we managed to turn rage into grief,

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,403
we will have made psychological progress
and this is the task today is behind 

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,860
rage very often is an unusual quality 
because we tend to feed the hungry.

8
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:38,694
People are sort of dark and pessimistic 
characters absolutely not scratch the 

9
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:47,751
surface of any regularly angry person 
and you will find a wild optimist.

10
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,823
It is in fact that drives range.
I think of the person who screens every 

11
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:57,120
time they can't find their housekeeper 
or every time they get stuck in traffic.

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,250
These unfortunate characters are 
evincing,

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,570
a curious but reckless faith in a world 
in which keys never go astray.

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,640
The roads are mysteriously traffic free.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,760
It is hope that is turbocharging rage.
So if were to get a little bit less sad,

16
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,933
uh,
and as a little less angry about our 

17
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:17,460
love lives,
we will have to diminish.

18
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,294
Some of the reason is that all of us 
will not manage to find the right 

19
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:27,930
person,
but we will probably all of us manage to

20
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:32,250
find a good enough so and that's 
success.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,113
In short,
we don't know very much how to love and 

22
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,860
it sounds very odd because it actually.
Somebody said,

23
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:38,694
you look,
all of us probably in this room would 

24
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:43,020
probably need to go to a school of law 
with a school of love.

25
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,490
Love is just an instinct.
No,

26
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:47,070
it's not.
It's a skill and it's a skill that needs

27
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:47,904
to be learned and it's a skill of it.
Our society refuses to consider as a 

28
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,444
skill.
We are meant to always just follow our 

29
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:53,250
feelings.

30
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,083
If you keep following your feelings,
you will almost certainly make a big 

31
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:59,700
mistake in your life.
What is love?

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,870
Ultimately?
Love,

33
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,730
I believe is something.
First of all,

34
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:05,240
there's a distinction between loving and
being loved.

35
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,240
We all start off in life by knowing a 
lot about being loved.

36
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:10,610
Being loved is the funded.
Uh,

37
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,170
that's when somebody brings you 
something on a tray and ask you how your

38
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:14,004
day at school went to federal.
And we grow up thinking that that is 

39
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:17,640
what's going to happen in an adult 
relationship.

40
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,100
We can be forgiven for that.
It's an understandable mistake,

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,173
but it's a very tragic mistake and it 
leads us not to pay attention to the 

42
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,550
other side of the equation which is to 
love.

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,473
And what does it really mean to love,
to love ultimately is to have the 

44
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:33,700
willingness to interpret someone's on 
the surface,

45
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,563
not very appealing behavior in order to 
find more benevolent reasons why it may 

46
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,574
be unfolding.

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,473
In other words,
to love someone is to apply charity and 

48
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:47,550
generosity of interpretation.
Problem is we live in a romantic culture

49
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:50,340
that privileges impulse and when it 
comes to love,

50
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,323
something tricky occurs because you 
don't have to be a paid up believer in 

51
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:55,914
psychotherapy or psychoanalysis to 
realize that the way we love as adults 

52
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:03,640
sits on top of our early childhood 
experiences and in early childhood.

53
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,713
The way that we learned about love was 
not just via experiences of tenderness 

54
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,904
and kindness and generosity.
The love that we would have tasted his 

55
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:17,230
children will also be bound up with 
experiences of being let down,

56
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,930
being humiliated.
Maybe being with a parent who treated us

57
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:24,610
very harshly scolded us or made us feel 
small in some way.

58
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,623
In other words,
quite a lot about our early experiences 

59
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,414
of love,
a bound up with various kinds of 

60
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,634
suffering.
Now something quite bad happens when we 

61
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,970
start to go out into the adult world and
start to choose love partners.

62
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,910
We think we're out to find partners who 
will make us happy,

63
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,253
but we were out to find partners who 
will feel familiar and that may be a 

64
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:46,414
very different thing.
