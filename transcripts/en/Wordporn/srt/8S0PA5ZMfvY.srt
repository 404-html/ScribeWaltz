1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,733
I wonder who might be without my fame,
who would I be if I said things that 

2
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:12,550
people didn't want to hear or if I 
defied their expectations of me,

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,103
what if I showed up to the party without
my Mardi gras back mask and refuse to 

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:18,124
flash my breasts for him full of beans?
I'll give you a moment to wipe that 

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,440
image out of your mind right when I was 
about 28,

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,440
after a decade as a professional 
comedian,

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,693
I realized one night in La with the 
purpose of my life had always been to 

8
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,030
free people from concern just like my 
dad,

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,530
and when I realized this,
I dubbed my new devotion,

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,190
the Church of freedom from concern,
the Church of FFC.

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,730
Thank you.
I dedicated myself to that ministry.

12
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,670
What's yours?
How will you serve the world?

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,210
What do they need that your talent can 
provide?

14
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,583
That's all you have to figure it out.
As someone who's done what you're about 

15
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:13,170
to go and do,
I can tell you from experience,

16
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:16,410
the effect you have on others is the 
most valuable currency.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,190
There is.
Everything you gain in life will rot and

18
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,024
fall apart and all that will be left of 
you is what was in your heart mind 

19
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,170
choosing to free people from concern me 
to the top of a mountain.

20
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,520
Look where I am.
Look what I get to everywhere I go,

21
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,490
I'm going to get emotional because when 
I tapped into this,

22
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:41,491
it really is extraordinary to me.
I did something that made people present

23
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,254
their best selves to meet wherever I go.
I am at the top of the mountain and I 

24
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:53,770
was and I the only.
The only one I hadn't freed was myself,

25
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,230
and that's when my search for identity 
deep.

26
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,370
You can join the game.
Fight the wars,

27
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:05,230
play with form all you want,
but to find real peace,

28
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:06,064
you have to let the armor,
your need for acceptance can make you 

29
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,630
invisible in this world.

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,330
Don't let anything stand in the way of 
the light that shines through this form.

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,553
Now,
fear is going to be a player in your 

32
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,254
life,
but you get to decide how much you can 

33
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:25,824
spend your whole life imagining ghosts,
worrying about the pathway to the 

34
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:29,424
future,
but all there will ever be is what's 

35
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:36,660
happening here and the decisions we make
in this moment which are based in either

36
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:37,494
love or fear.
So many of us choose our path out of 

37
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:45,891
fear disguised as practicality.
What we really want seems impossibly out

38
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:50,830
of reach and ridiculous to expect,
so we never dared asked the universe for

39
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:51,664
it.
I'm saying I'm the proof that you can 

40
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:59,621
ask the universe for it.
I learned many great lessons from my not

41
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,220
the least of which was that you can fail
at what you don't want,

42
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,940
so you might as well take a chance on 
doing what you love.

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,320
The thank you.
