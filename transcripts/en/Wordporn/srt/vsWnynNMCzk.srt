1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,220
I am very aware of the preciousness of 
time.

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,843
Yeah.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,290
I have spent my life traveling across 
the my mind,

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,780
true theoretical physics.
I had sought to answer some of the Great

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,843
Westerns,
but there are other challenges or big 

6
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,863
lessons slips must be answered,
but these little also need a new 

7
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:36,784
generation who are interested and 
engaged with an understanding of 

8
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:45,030
science.
I will eat,

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,040
feed an ever growing population,
provide clean water lender and renewable

10
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:53,560
energy,
resentment your disease,

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,710
but slow down global climate change.
What up duck arrayed revelation.

12
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:06,971
Some dumb ass comes up perspective.
It has gifted humanity on ourselves.

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,470
When we see the earth from space,
we see ourselves as suppo.

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,033
[inaudible] divisions did is such a 
simple image with a compelling message 

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,040
that when human race,
we are here together and we made to live

16
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,550
her with tolerance and respect.
We must become global citizens.

17
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,130
We are all time traveler journeying 
together into the future.

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,330
Let let us work together or tell me 
cause that's a future.

19
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,790
[inaudible] be brave.
We determined over a company that can be

20
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,654
done.

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,950
Seize the moment.

22
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,313
No.
