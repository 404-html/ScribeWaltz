1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,030
Can you imagine a world where 10 million
people are happier?

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,180
My my I'd go to them is very 
straightforward.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,860
I developed it because I could not 
really define what happiness was,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,833
so I took as many arbitrary points of 
data where I felt happy and try to find 

5
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:23,604
what was common between them.
What was common between them was the 

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,053
equation of happiness and it is this 
happiness is equal to or greater than 

7
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:30,744
the difference between the way you see 
the events of your life and your 

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,950
expectation of how life should behave.
In the modern world.

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,023
We mixed two states.
One of them is happiness and the other 

10
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:43,980
is fun.
Happiness is that peaceful,

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,790
contentment feeling of I like the word 
as it is right now.

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,770
Fun is the modern world's replacement of
happiness.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,693
It's,
you know when I am unable to reach that 

14
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,770
state of happiness,
what I do is I go out on the weekend and

15
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:00,150
I go to a party and boom,
boom,

16
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:00,984
boom,
boom.

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,460
My brain stops thinking.
As long as it's stops thinking I fee,

18
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:06,294
I think I feel happy.
Happiness is not about what the world 

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,770
gives you.
How much water is in this class?

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,770
Happiness is about what you think about 
what the word gives you.

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,400
If you think about it properly,
you will always see that as something to

22
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:19,590
be grateful for,
something to be happy about.

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,780
I think losing it was the call to 
action.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,430
I lost my son.
All of a sudden like from,

25
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,383
you know,
from having a happy holiday together to 

26
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:34,654
losing him was four hours and the 
question that hits me at the time was 

27
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,580
what can I do now to bring him back and 
nothing I could have ever done including

28
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,683
locking my sense in the room and crying 
for the rest of my life would bring him 

29
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:50,644
back.
And to me the whole idea was I can 

30
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:55,354
either choose to suffer or I can choose 
to sort of accept life as harsh as it 

31
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:04,570
has become and try to make it slightly 
better than it is today.

32
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,550
So let's make it slightly better 
tomorrow.

33
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,860
So the way I did it was very 
interesting.

34
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:10,660
I,
I basically set myself a target.

35
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,523
I said,
wouldn't it be amazing if I can reach 

36
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,290
out to 10 million people and just give 
them that message?

37
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,483
It wouldn't bring it back,
but it would be likely that they'd been 

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,770
today,
and that is truly,

39
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,840
truly,
I would say successful my life.

40
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,590
That has never been a moment in my life 
what I felt I was having a better impact

41
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:33,424
on the Ndis.
