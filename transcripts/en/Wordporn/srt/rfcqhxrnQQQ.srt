1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,600
You take a drink with your friends and 
somebody says,

2
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:08,610
yeah,
we should go skydiving tomorrow,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,560
and you go,
yeah,

4
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:12,380
we'll go skydiving,
or yes,

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,030
so then that night you're laying in your
bed and you just keep.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,963
You're terrified.
You keep imagining over and over again 

7
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:27,660
jumping out of an airplane and you can't
figure out why you would do that and you

8
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,360
laying there and you have the worst 
night's sleep of your life.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,463
You wake up the next day and you go down
and you said where you were going to 

10
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:34,734
meet and everybody's there,
so you get in a van and you don't know 

11
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,444
that your friends had the same night 
that you had because they're pretended 

12
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:42,481
like they didn't.
They were like,

13
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,314
yeah man,
my uncle is a navy seal and you know 

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,580
this is going to be great.
I'm looking forward to this.

15
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,930
And you're like,
oh my God.

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,630
Oh my God,
and your stomach is terrible.

17
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:52,464
You can't eat and everything,
but you don't want to be the only one 

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,973
who doesn't jump out of this airplane.
So you get there and then you have the 

19
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:00,544
safety brief and you're standing there.
And the guys will tell you what the 

20
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,770
chute doesn't open.
What's going to happen is you're doing,

21
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:09,420
you want help with.
So you fly and you go up,

22
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:11,820
you go up,
you go up and you go up to 14,000

23
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,654
feet and you notice there's a.
A light is red and it's yellow and 

24
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:17,910
green,
right?

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,610
So right now the light's red.
So then you start thinking,

26
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,440
at some point the light's going to go 
green.

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,970
If you don't know what's going to 
happen,

28
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,103
right?
And you wait and negotiate yellow and 

29
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,610
the light goes green and somebody opens 
the door.

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,593
And in that moment you realize you've 
never been in a freaking airplane with 

31
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:34,224
the door open.

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,380
And you go and the guy walks you up to 
the end of the thing and you're standing

33
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:45,831
and your toes are on the edge and you're
looking out down to death.

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,530
And they say,
Oh,

35
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,030
I'm three.
And they say one,

36
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,130
two.
And he pushes you on to.

37
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:58,131
Because people grab on three and you go 
and you fall out of the airplane.

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,533
And in one second you realize that it's 
the most blissful experience of your 

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,470
life.
Your flying right,

40
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,570
it doesn't feel like falling,
right?

41
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:13,404
It's like you actually are kind of held 
a little bit by the wind and then you 

42
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,350
start and you start falling.
You're falling and you.

43
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,543
There's zero fear.
You realize that the point of maximum 

44
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:29,181
danger is the point of minimum fear.
It's bless,

45
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,043
bless,
and you're flying and you're doing that 

46
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:39,510
and then 20 seconds,
25 seconds,

47
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,750
40 seconds,
and you have enough time to just kind of

48
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:44,070
like,
oh shit.

49
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,920
That's that building.
I,

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,753
I like that.

51
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,993
And the lesson for me was,
why were you scared in your bed the 

52
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:55,800
night before?
Why did you.

53
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,770
What do you need that fear for bundling 
you scared in your bed.

54
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:04,000
Sixteen hours before you jump.
Why are you scared in the car?

55
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,640
Why could you not enjoy breakfast with 
what?

56
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,533
What?
What did you need to fear is fear of 

57
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:12,574
what?
You're nowhere even near to the 

58
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:18,100
airplane.
Everything up to the stepping out.

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,400
There's actually no reason to be scared.
It only just ruins your day,

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,360
your.
You don't have to jump,

61
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,643
and then in that moment,
all of a sudden where you should be 

62
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:33,010
terrified is the most blissful 
experience of your life,

63
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,310
and God placed the best things in life 
on the other side of terror,

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,480
on the other side of your maximum fear,
all of the best things in life.
