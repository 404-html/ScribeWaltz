1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,260
The physical universe is basically it 
playful.

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,640
There is no necessity for it whatsoever.
It isn't going anywhere.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,103
That is to say it doesn't have some 
destination that it ought to arrive at 

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,173
that it is best understood by analogy 
with music because music as an art form 

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,700
is essentially playful.
We say you play the piano,

6
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,503
you don't work the piano.
Why music differs from say travel when 

7
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:37,824
you travel you are trying to get 
somewhere in music though one doesn't 

8
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,294
make the end all the composition.
The point if that was so the best 

9
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:51,704
conductors would be those who played 
faster and there would be composers who 

10
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:59,711
wrote of lifting people go to concert,
just hear one crashing call cause that's

11
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:02,090
the end.
Say went dancing.

12
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,430
You don't aim at a particular spot in 
the room.

13
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,563
That's where you should arrive.
The whole point of the dancing of the 

14
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:08,714
doubt,
but we don't see that as something 

15
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,750
brought by our education into our 
everyday conduct.

16
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,410
We've got a system of schooling but 
gives a completely different impression.

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,310
It's all graded and what we do is we put
the child into the corridor of this raid

18
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:26,361
system.
Well,

19
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:27,550
it kind of come on Kitty,
kitty,

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,010
kitty.
Yeah.

21
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,853
You go to kindergarten,
you know that's a great thing because 

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,913
when you finish that,
you'll get into first grade and then 

23
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,690
come on first grade needs the second 
grade and so on.

24
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:38,524
And then you'd get out of grade school,
you've got high school and it's revving 

25
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,640
up.
The thing is coming.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,210
Then you're going to go to college by 
Jovan.

27
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,470
You get into graduate school and when 
you're through with graduate school,

28
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,323
you go out to join the world.
Then you'll get into some racket where 

29
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,074
you're selling insurance and they've got
that quota to make and you're going to 

30
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:58,570
make that.
And all the time the thing is coming,

31
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,220
it's coming,
it's coming.

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,340
That great thing,
the success you're working.

33
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,960
And then when you wake up one day,
about 40 years old,

34
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,400
you say,
my God,

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,340
I've arrived.
I'm there.

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,430
And you don't feel very different from 
what you always felt.

37
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,650
Okay.
What would the people who live to retire

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,913
and put those savings away and then when
they 65 they don't have any energy left 

39
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,244
that more or less important.
And they go and in an old people's 

40
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,440
senior citizens community,
because we've sinned,

41
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,274
did cheated ourselves the whole way down
the line did we thought of life by 

42
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:36,234
analogy with a journey,
with a pilgrimage which had a serious 

43
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:40,314
purpose at the end.
And the thing was to get to that end 

44
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,420
success or whatever it is,
or maybe Heaven after you're dead,

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,310
but we missed the point the whole way 
along.

46
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,713
It was a musical thing and you were 
supposed to sing or to dance while the 

47
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,650
music was being played.
