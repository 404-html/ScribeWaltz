1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,260
There I was and I met a beautiful woman,
the mother of Nigeria to come.

2
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,540
I lived left for 15 years and we are to 
have children.

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,380
Their eyes there.
Those windows to the soul actually was a

4
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:27,160
lie.
He was so alive and so sensitive.

5
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,140
She became touched by,
I don't know,

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,080
I want to stress because depression came
in.

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,550
She became psychotic,
different personalities,

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,220
such a beautiful woman.
So the mother of my kids,

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,730
my love.
Fifteen years,

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,250
she jumped from my eighth story.

11
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,923
I didn't see it coming,
but I saw the declining line of life 

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,640
getting out of her control that a lot 
alone with four kids.

13
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,170
This is life beyond this.
I was hoping and couldn't do anything,

14
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,370
but I always had this deep,
strange feeling.

15
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,180
Something more and I don't know what it 
is and it's not in words.

16
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,810
It's a feeling.
It's a grieving from the inside,

17
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:39,750
from the soul,
from survival,

18
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,643
but it got into me like a flash and I 
had to go on the spot to show the world 

19
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,270
that we don't need to be powerless in 
the face of death,

20
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,000
in the face of darkness,
depression,

21
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,940
trauma,
Ptsd.

22
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,250
Bipolar,
schizophrenia,

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,400
it wasn't that I was looking for it,
I just wanted to answers of life like it

24
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:09,954
is a birthright to know why you're here,
why you're here as a father of two to 

25
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,014
bring purpose sense.
That is the simple and it is being 

26
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:29,010
torpedoed that bill bought by all kinds 
of things and confusing sets in.

27
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,010
No,
this was too much.

28
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,110
This was the emotional tone in my heart 
to be healed.

29
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,423
Not only to become aware of how to do 
that and to take away the documents for 

30
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:50,270
those to come.
That was my journey,

31
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,170
so how to begin.
The only thing I had was my instinct,

32
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:59,060
my intuition.
It's the way it's taught it.

33
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,710
What do you do?
You do 26 rackets in ice.

34
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:06,544
Cold water is the most dangerous.
You'll go climb mount everest in his 

35
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:12,290
shorts.
That would kill most people.

36
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,293
Use Swim under the ice.
I lose the way and you don't know where 

37
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:21,041
you are and and it's frozen and you 
don't know or you go,

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,673
you survive.
I was able to stay for five to seven 

39
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,174
minutes every time onto the ice and the 
only thing I ever ate away at the 

40
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,373
bedside,
which we have lost silence is powerful 

41
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,070
silence.
It's dense.

42
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,160
It's what I find.

43
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,780
I just wanted to feel good.
I just wanted to feel connected.

44
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,790
I showed him,
but still the cynicism and the market,

45
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,430
not only with the scientists know world,
this mockery,

46
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,730
if it happens 30 years,
35 years,

47
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,730
like decades.
That really gets into you,

48
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,660
but I just feel good so I just follow my
feeling.

49
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,490
Twenty six world records later,
hey,

50
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,373
would I can do anybody can do.
It's not about becoming superman or 

51
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:36,354
superwoman or like these archetypes.
It's becoming you yourself and superior 

52
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,823
to what we have learned.
They did an experiment on me with the 

53
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:47,944
Vegas nerve and to see if I was able to 
compare to all those who weren't and 

54
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:58,720
yes,
I showed complete control over the vegas

55
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:02,560
nerve which is dealing with all the 
organs.

56
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,100
I don't want to make you nervous system 
and it was,

57
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,610
and that means you have influenced their
right.

58
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,443
You have influence on inflammation.
Inflammation is the cause of any 

59
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:18,331
disease,
but he's the iceman we can do with it.

60
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,013
Yeah.
He is an exception that confirms the 

61
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,990
rule and I said,
no,

62
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:23,351
no,
no,

63
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:23,611
no,
no,

64
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:27,520
no.
What I can do you can do to that a.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,550
finally they said,
okay,

66
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,760
let's do a comparative study.
How much time do we need to teach people

67
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:39,530
to get a little bit to the results you 
have produced in a laboratory setting?

68
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,543
It took me four days to bring people 
both in freezing temperatures without 

69
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,030
form experience on wantons cope town.
Four days later,

70
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,770
we had endotoxemia,
everybody doing it and 100 percent score

71
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,604
within a quarter of an hour.
They could suppress it and compare to 

72
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,390
16,000
others.

73
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,443
They had to compete to prove outcomes.
That changed the medical books that 

74
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,450
year.
Tournament's nervous system.

75
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,220
The innate immune system into Korean 
system can be deeply influenced at will.

76
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,423
We have shown that because it was my 
wife and I was hopeless then I couldn't 

77
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,250
deal with psychosis and depression or 
no.

78
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,610
Now I am so far that nature has provided
me with all the insights and Ansys and I

79
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:31,010
brought it to brain scans,
how to tackle bipolar depression,

80
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:31,963
how to take over the power of the brain 
inside the brain to deal with that what 

81
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:41,150
causes bipolar,
depression,

82
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,253
inflammation in the in the brain because
nature has the answers and what they 

83
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:48,554
think.
Cancer and depression and all those 

84
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:52,940
things only with pills and chemos,
man,

85
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:53,661
man,
man,

86
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:55,190
man,
cancer patients,

87
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,233
a million a year.
You don't want to lose those clients 

88
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,200
seek well,
we live off people being sick.

89
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,393
That makes a healthy economy.
We are able to change this second world 

90
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,383
ruled by people who think they can make 
money out of pills and medicines and 

91
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:23,360
think that is the condition of the human
race and we have no other way.

92
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,703
The real terrorists is making us believe
that we are not able to control our 

93
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,633
inner physiology.
You know the pharmaceuticals in any 

94
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:38,540
other industry,
how much they use in,

95
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,350
in money for advertising,
for brainwashing.

96
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,380
Our minds making us believe that 
dependency in doctors,

97
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,360
healthcare pills and medicines and 
therapies,

98
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,550
that is the way to go with hell and not 
look within ourselves.

99
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,640
The are the industries will rule over 
our moorings and show by data what it is

100
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,130
to go in to the deepest of our 
physiology,

101
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,643
at-will that makes us able to get rid of
medicines and pills and changed our 

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,560
capacity of what we think is possible in
healthcare,

103
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,880
both mentally and physical.
We take out the villain.

104
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,970
We take out a real terrorist which is 
killing right now,

105
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,700
millions of people every year and that 
war we make visible and that adding,

106
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,803
we are going to take data and bringing 
back the belief that we are the masters 

107
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,140
of our own mind.
