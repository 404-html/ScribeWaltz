1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,353
The concept of anger,
I think we have to think about the 

2
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:12,710
phases of anger.
There are three phases of anger.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,000
One is somebody provokes me,
I feel angry.

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,670
Okay,
I don't have any control over that.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,073
Right?
Then there's the phase of anger of how 

6
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:27,320
do I react to it?
Do I walk away?

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,860
Do I respond,
do I punch the guy in the face,

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,700
but I call them with something in it.
That's my reaction to anger,

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,180
and then the other thing is,
okay,

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,350
I didn't have any choice to being 
feeling angry when I was provoked.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,150
How long am I going to hold onto that 
anger?

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,090
An hour a day,
22 years,

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,630
right?
So in order to keep things straight,

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,710
I give these three phases,
three different names,

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,100
the feeling of anger,
I call anger.

16
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,790
The reaction to anger I call rage and 
they're hanging onto the anger is called

17
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:06,660
resentment.
Right?

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,960
And then as you clarify and I said,
okay,

19
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,123
I can do nothing about my feeling of 
anger other than perhaps take some 

20
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:17,180
things in perspective,
right?

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,113
One of my father's teachings that helped
me a great deal was that when somebody 

22
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,200
did something to my father,
which should have a provoked anger,

23
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,450
my father would say,
you know,

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,793
what he did was so foolish.
If he only knew how fully said was what 

25
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:38,360
he did,
he wouldn't have done it.

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,860
So,
you know,

27
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,110
I feel sorry for the person for being 
such a fool,

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,740
but if she feels sorry for a person,
how can you be angry at him?

29
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,570
Yeah.
I feel pity for him.

30
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:50,290
Pity and anger girl doesn't go together.
Uh,

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,433
but nevertheless,
I can't control how I feel when 

32
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:54,734
provoked,
but I certainly can't control what my 

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,040
reaction is going to be.
And finally,

34
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,933
how long do I hang on to the resentment.
Like greatest lesson came from 

35
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,280
alcoholics anonymous where somebody 
said,

36
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,863
harboring your resentment is allowing 
someone who you don't like to live 

37
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:14,300
inside your head without paying any 
rent.

38
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,493
And I'm not that kind of a guy.
I'm not a nice guy like that to let 

39
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,560
somebody else.
Right?

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,480
So Aa helped me get rid of resentments.
Uh,

41
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,403
reacting to anger took me awhile to be 
able to control my rage and then I had 

42
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:35,960
to realize that this is part of my 
being.

43
00:02:35,961 --> 00:02:39,440
Human animals react with rage when,
when provoked,

44
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,410
right?
I as a human being,

45
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,800
am I supposed to be above that and 
middle earth and Homo sapiens.

46
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:51,130
So I learned how to control my anger.
So I think those are.

47
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:53,410
If a person keeps those things in mind,
right?

48
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,380
And there's some people who feel guilty 
for feeling angry,

49
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,950
right?
Especially a parent.

50
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,600
You don't have a choice,
right?

51
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,760
The feeling of anger is loving yourself.
And if you don't have a choice,

52
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:06,970
there's was a reason to feel guilty 
about it.

53
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,680
How you react.

54
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,100
No.
My suggestion is keep an anger journal.

55
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,110
All right,
here's what happened today,

56
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,560
right?
Somebody did this is at,

57
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,760
and here's how I did right.
Then at night,

58
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,613
is it at the time that I'm provoked,
I think it gives them clear because I'm 

59
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,294
under pressure to respond,
but at night when I look over what 

60
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,064
happened during the daytime and I say 
that I handled that in the best way 

61
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:37,744
possible,
could I have done something better and 

62
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:42,710
that becomes a lesson for the next time.
All right,

63
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,030
so I think keeping a journal about anger
and how we respond to it is an excellent

64
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:53,110
way overnight because ultimately if I am
an raged,

65
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,500
it doesn't hurt the other person as much
as it hurts me.
