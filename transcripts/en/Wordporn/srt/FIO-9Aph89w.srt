1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,430
I saw myself as the weakest person God 
ever created.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,270
I got called nigger every day of my life
growing up,

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,770
living in a small town.
The uh,

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,020
one of the high ups in the KKK son sat 
behind me two classes,

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,750
so he called me nigger all the time.
I got my first car,

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,790
they spray painted nigger ruin to kill 
you on it.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,120
And I was weighing like 297 pounds.
So I was just an insecure,

8
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,370
scared kid.
But the best thing that happened to me,

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,683
no one helped me.
I wasn't going to be a punk kid all my 

10
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:41,750
life.
So the way I could turn it around was to

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,613
suffer.
I had to build calluses in my brain the 

12
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:49,010
same way I built calluses on my hands.
So I brought against.

13
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:51,080
But the role is record for posts a long 
time ago.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,230
But I failed at it twice and I did 
67,000

15
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,100
pullups trying to break this record.

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,800
So to do 4,030
pull ups,

17
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,010
I had to do $67,000
for training for that.

18
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,903
Wow.
And so what I realized is for me to 

19
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:08,504
become the man,
I wanted to become a saw myself as the 

20
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:11,714
weakest person God ever created.
But I never blamed God for anything he 

21
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:15,914
did to me.
So I wanted to change that to be the 

22
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,710
hardest man ever created.
Am I that?

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,933
I don't know,
but he had to have a goal in my goal 

24
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,590
when I was sitting there not going to 
school,

25
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,740
being bullied,
being having no self esteem.

26
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,150
My goal was the only person that could 
turn this person around is me.

27
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,780
I was so driven.
I'm not going to say motivated.

28
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:44,870
[inaudible] motivation's crap.
Motivation comes and goes.

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,333
When you're driven,
whatever's in front of you will get 

30
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:50,300
destroyed.
We live in an external world.

31
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,660
Everything is is you get to see it,
touch it.

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,610
It's external.
If you can for the rest of your life,

33
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,870
live inside of yourself.
Stop listening to people who are calling

34
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:03,890
you fat,
gay,

35
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,210
transsexual,
nigger.

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,253
Everything that is makes no sense.
All these insecure people putting their 

37
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:11,030
insecurities on you,
you got to flush it out.

38
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,160
You gotta just be whoever the Hell God 
or whatever the hell you believe in.

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,180
If you believe in nothing but yourself,
I don't care where it is.

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,240
You got to take everything and throw it 
away.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,393
You have to believe in one thing and 
that is yourself and I'm not saying 

42
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:28,220
don't believe in God and we should 
believe in,

43
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:32,150
but right now for you to find greatness 
in yourself,

44
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,520
you're not going to find it by looking 
in a book or by even hearing me,

45
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,803
I may give you the spark,
but you've got to go inside yourself to 

46
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:43,004
find it.

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
How to ask the question,
how are you going to do that?

48
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,950
Thicken your skin,
become more of a human being.

49
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,173
Don't be afraid of the reflection in the
mirror because that's all you can be 

50
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,464
afraid of.
Once you overcome the reflection in the 

51
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,670
mirror,
on the other side is greatness.

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,230
That's what people are saying by me 
running.

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,100
I'm callus in my mind.
I'm not training for a race.

54
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,240
I'm training for life.
I'm training for the time.

55
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:11,920
When I get that 2:00
in the morning call,

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,970
my mom is dead or something happens.
Tragic in life.

57
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,950
I don't fall apart.
I'm training my mind and my body,

58
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,803
my spirit,
so it's all one so I can handle what 

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,150
life is gonna throw at me because the 
life I've lived,

60
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,883
it throws a whole bunch at you and if 
you're not physically and mentally 

61
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:30,874
prepare for that,
you're just going to crumble and you're 

62
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,204
good for nobody.

63
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,223
In Times of suffering,
what we do is we forget how hard we 

64
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,700
really are because that's what suffering
is.

65
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,770
Suffering's a test.
That's all it is.

66
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,460
Suffering is the true test of life.
The beauty is remembering this young,

67
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,680
dumb what people called Nigger is now 
where I'm at today,

68
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,990
and that is when you finally get to that
point,

69
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:59,410
for me,
it's forever lasting peace.

70
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,460
Greatness isn't running towards your 
miles at the time of doing 40,000

71
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,294
posts of being a seal.
Greatness is whatever the hell you 

72
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:10,600
dreamed of in your own mind.
You got to first see it.

73
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,440
You got first create this vision in your
mind and the national.

74
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:18,760
I come into play once you create this 
vision in your mind is how am I going to

75
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,670
get there?
Now we're all we are all great.

76
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,440
No matter if,
if you think you're dumb,

77
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,580
think you're fat.
No matter if you are fat,

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,710
no matter if you've been bullied or no 
matter if you just got back from Iraq or

79
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:35,760
Afghanistan and you have no legs or your
arms or whatever,

80
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:37,710
man,
we all have greatness.

81
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,083
It just got to find the courage.
You got to find the courage to put your 

82
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,374
bose headphones on and silence the noise
out of this world in defined it that 

83
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:52,920
sets you apart from everybody else,
and that's.
