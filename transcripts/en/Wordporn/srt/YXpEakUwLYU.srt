1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,453
Somehow part of the package of being a 
living thinking being is that you get a 

2
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:16,000
universe inside of you.
You know,

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,030
you get a galaxy sized object inside you
that you can access.

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,900
And there there are the mountains,
the rivers,

5
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,720
the jungles,
the dynastic families,

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,420
the ruins,
the planets,

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,380
the work sofar,
the poetry,

8
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:33,214
the sciences,
the magics of millions upon millions 

9
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,980
upon millions of worlds.
And this is apparently who we each are.

10
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,053
We're a little bit of eternity sticking 
into three dimensional space and for 

11
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:52,450
some reason occupying time in a monkey 
Bondi.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,900
But when you turn your eyes then inward,
you discover the birthright,

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,173
the,
the existential tax out of which this 

14
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:08,161
particular existence emerged.
And it's a great secret,

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,720
a great secret,
and the great comfort because it means,

16
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:14,554
you know,
mystery didn't die with the fall of our 

17
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,280
third or the fall of Atlantis or the 
fall of anything.

18
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,360
Mystery is alive in the moment,
in the here and now.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,550
It just simply lies on the other side of
the barrier of courage.

20
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,070
And it isn't even that high of a 
barrier.

21
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,310
It just is a barrier high enough to keep
out the insincere and the misdirected.

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,600
But for those who will claim it in the 
midst of the historic,

23
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:45,430
okay,
awesome.

24
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,430
The late 20th century,
they become the archaic pioneers.

25
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:56,610
They become the first people to carry 
the aura borek serpent around to its own

26
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:03,181
tail and to make a closure to the degree
that any one of us has this,

27
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:05,674
uh,
this connection back to the archaic in 

28
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:08,944
our life,
it makes where we have been make a lot 

29
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:17,851
more sense and it makes where we're 
going seem a lot more inviting,

30
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,710
which it really is.

31
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,603
Yes.
