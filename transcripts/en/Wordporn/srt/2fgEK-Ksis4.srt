1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,860
We don't have to have fast food workers,
we don't,

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,030
we don't have to have people who work 
shit

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,270
jobs,
we don't have to,

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:14,150
which Si to figure out how to 
restructure society.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,440
So everybody somehow another plays a 
part has something to contribute,

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,333
something to share.
I mean that's what a real society is 

7
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:23,540
supposed to be like.
I've given you some coconuts.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,190
You get me some fish,
you know,

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,250
we make a deal and you do it back and 
forth and left and right,

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,000
and when there's nothing to contribute,
then you start looking.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,580
The president needs to give us jobs.
We need jobs.

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,983
So instead of something to contribute,
you just find something to do with your 

13
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:38,924
time and then it becomes about doing 
that more than it becomes about finding 

14
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,124
something to contribute.
So society gets wrapped around becoming 

15
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:51,110
a part of a machine society instead of 
becoming a bunch of individuals that are

16
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:51,944
expressing themselves in unique ways and
everybody's sort of borrows and shares 

17
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:57,560
and sells this and you sell that.

18
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,320
And we all sort of figured out how we 
can contribute in a society.

19
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,530
We got sidetracked and diverted into 
these boxes that they call companies and

20
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:09,020
corporations and we got stuck into these
containers.

21
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:12,290
They go cubicles or offices and we've 
got forced into this system,

22
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,124
so our time,
instead of it being invested in making 

23
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:16,874
pottery or or fixing cars or doing 
something where you have a passion or 

24
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:26,750
you have some sort of a connection to 
instead of that you've sold your life to

25
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,584
sit in a box and work for a machine,
an uncaring machine that demands 

26
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:33,590
productivity,
doesn't understand you.

27
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:34,424
It doesn't want to understand you.
It has a bunch of very strict things in 

28
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:39,770
order to keep the humor at a minimum in 
the office,

29
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:40,604
just in case one fuckheads says some 
stupid sex jokes that gets him sued and 

30
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:45,890
they have to give somebody a million 
dollars.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,100
So get it together and this is your life
now.

32
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,100
No natural behavior.
Everybody's wearing clothes.

33
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:52,934
They don't want to where everybody's 
showing up and doing something they 

34
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:56,470
don't want to do.
They have no connection to.

35
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,613
That's the problem with our society and 
then what's the reward for all this 

36
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:01,510
stuff?
Go on,

37
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,110
get a big TV,
go home,

38
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:05,930
you're going to get a shiny belt buckle,
you're going to get a nice purse.

39
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:08,060
You're going to wear shoes that you 
couldn't afford last week.

40
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,103
You got to get that dream car and every 
week we're chasing down this new object 

41
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:15,960
and every week trying to fill this hole 
in this,

42
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,823
this,
this sad shadow of a life that we've 

43
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:23,150
been left with after work that you work 
eight to whatever,

44
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:28,151
the hours a day plus commuting and then 
you'll like this and that's your life.

45
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,100
That's your real fucking life.

46
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,120
All that other stuff is not your life 
anymore.

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,140
All that other stuff is work and most of
us have committed to that.

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I know you've been there before and I've
been there before and we understand that

49
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:44,570
it's trapped as we got out of it,
but for the people that are in it,

50
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,790
a lot of times they don't even 
understand it's a trap.

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,850
They just think it's a good job.
The thing that got dental,

52
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,350
I'm doing really good and I got my own 
parking spot.

53
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,184
It's got my name on it.
Just a piece of a heartless shitty 

54
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,390
machine that makes money.
