00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,770
Today,
I want to tell you three stories from my

2
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:07,604
life at that time offered perhaps the 
best calligraphy instruction in the 

3
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:16,760
country throughout the campus.
Every poster,

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,743
every label on every drawer was 
beautifully hand calligraphic because I 

5
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,740
had dropped out and didn't have to take 
the normal classes.

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,430
I decided to take a calligraphy class to
learn how to do this.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,260
None of this had even a hope of any 
practical application in my life,

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,370
but 10 years later when we were 
designing the first macintosh computer,

9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,750
it all came back to me and we designed 
it all into the Mac.

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,600
It was the first computer with beautiful
typography.

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,183
Of course,
it was impossible to connect the dots 

12
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,810
looking forward when I was in college,
but it was very,

13
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:52,460
very clear.
Looking backwards.

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,680
Ten years later,
again,

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,930
you can't connect the dots looking 
forward.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,973
You can only connect them looking 
backwards so you have to trust that the 

17
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:03,170
dots will somehow connect in your 
future.

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,710
You have to trust in something,
your gut destiny,

19
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:07,700
life,
Karma,

20
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:11,240
whatever was.
And I started apple in my parents garage

21
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:14,960
when I was 20.
We worked hard and in 10 years apple had

22
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:18,350
grown from just the two of us in the 
garage into a $2,000,000,000

23
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:20,330
company with over 4,000
employees.

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,530
We just released our finest creation,
the macintosh a year earlier,

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,070
and I just turned 30 and then I got 
fired,

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,360
but something slowly began to dawn on 
me.

27
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,100
I still loved what I did.
I've been rejected,

28
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,330
but I was still in love and so I decided
to start over.

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,583
The heaviness of being successful was 
replaced by the lightness of being a 

30
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:46,634
beginner,
again,

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,030
less sure about everything.
During the next five years,

32
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:53,480
I started a company named next,
another company named Pixar.

33
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,590
Pixar went on to create the world's 
first computer animated feature film and

34
00:01:57,591 --> 00:02:00,620
is now the most successful animation 
studio in the world.

35
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,023
I'm convinced that the only thing that 
kept me going was that I loved what I 

36
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:05,234
did.
You got to find what you love and the 

37
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:11,420
only way to be truly satisfied is to do 
what you believe is great work,

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,320
and the only way to do great work is to 
love what you do.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,760
If you haven't found it yet,
keep looking and don't settle.

40
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,373
Your time is limited,
so don't waste it living someone else's 

41
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:25,484
life.
Don't let the noise of other's opinions 

42
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:30,950
drowned out your own inner voice and 
most important,

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,560
have the courage to follow your heart 
and intuition.

44
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,160
They somehow already know what you truly
want to do.
