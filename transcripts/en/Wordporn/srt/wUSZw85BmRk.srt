1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,240
So me and Jayda was reflecting about,
and I asked her,

2
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:13,630
I said,
what did she think was,

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,023
you know,
one of the biggest revelations that she 

4
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:19,534
had had about love?
She said that you cannot make a person 

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,420
happy.
You can make a person smile.

6
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:33,740
You can make a person feel good.
You can make a person laugh,

7
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,143
but whether or not a person is happy is 
deeply and totally and utterly out of 

8
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:45,701
your control.
We came into this false romantic concept

9
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,270
that somehow when we got married that we
would become one.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,793
And what we realized is that we were two
completely separate people on two 

11
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:04,484
completely separate individual journeys 
and that we were choosing to walk our 

12
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:15,401
separate journey these together,
but her happiness was her responsibility

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,600
and my happiness was my responsibility.

14
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,510
We decided that we were going to find 
our individual internal private,

15
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:30,814
separate joy.
Then we were going to present ourselves 

16
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,440
to the relationship and to each other 
already happened.

17
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,533
It's kind of an unrealistic and can be 
destructive to place the responsibility 

18
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:54,430
for your happiness on anybody other than
yourself.
