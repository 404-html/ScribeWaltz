1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,270
I hated that job and I clung to that job
10 years in a place without heat,

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,700
six years at a job.
I felt stuck in.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,500
Maybe I was afraid of change.
Are you?

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,240
When I was 29,
I told myself the next acting job I get,

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,590
no matter what it pays,
I will from now on,

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,480
for better or worse be a working actor 
now.

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,840
I didn't have either the internet or a 
cellphone or a job,

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,503
but something good happened.
I got a loping theater job in a play 

9
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:46,381
called imperfect love,
which led to a film called 13 moons with

10
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:51,961
the same writer which led to other roles
which led to other roles and I've worked

11
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:57,991
as an actor ever since.
I didn't know that would happen at 29,

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,610
walking away from data processing.
I was terrified,

13
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,630
but this made me very hungry.
Literally

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,343
I couldn't be lazy.
Now I tell this story because the world 

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,690
might say,
you are not allowed to yet.

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,393
Please don't even bother asking.
Don't bother telling the world you 

17
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,570
already show it.
Do it.

18
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,930
Trust me.
Rhythm sets in.

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Just try not to wait until like me,
your 29 before you find it,

20
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,770
and if you are,
that's fine too.

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,500
Some of us never find it,
but you will.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,120
I promise you,
raise the rest of your life to meet you.

23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,650
Don't search for defining moments 
because they will never come.

24
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,163
The moments that define you have already
happened and they will already happen 

25
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,903
again.
Don't wait until they tell you you are 

26
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:16,540
ready.
Get in there.

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,320
I waited a long time out in the world 
before I gave myself permission to fail.

28
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,240
What did becky say?
Ever tried,

29
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,750
ever failed.
No matter.

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,230
Try again.
Fail again.

31
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,990
Fail better.
The world is yours.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,350
Treat everyone kindly and light up the 
night.

33
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,960
Thank you so much for having me here.
