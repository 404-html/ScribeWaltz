1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,070
You happy with what you got because the 
owners of this country don't want that.

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,120
I'm talking about the real owners now,
the real owners,

3
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:14,954
the big wealthy business interests that 
control things and make all the 

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,420
important decisions they get.
The politicians,

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,313
the politicians are put there to give 
you the idea that you have freedom of 

6
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:24,950
choice.
You don't.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,040
You have no choice.
You have owners,

8
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,130
they own you.
They own everything.

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,070
They own all the important land.
They own and control the corporations.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,860
They've long since bought and paid for 
the Senate,

11
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:38,600
the Congress,
the state houses and city halls.

12
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:42,090
They got the back pockets and they own 
all the big media company,

13
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:44,720
so they control just about all of the 
news and information.

14
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:47,240
You get to here.
They got you by the balls.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,200
They spend billions of dollars every 
year lobbying to get what they want.

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,080
Well,
we know what they want.

17
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,690
They want more for themselves and less 
for everybody else,

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,950
but I'll tell you what they don't want.
They don't want a population of citizens

19
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:06,350
capable of critical thinking.
They don't want well informed,

20
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,170
well educated people capable of critical
thinking.

21
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:11,360
Then I didn't,
she didn't that that doesn't help them.

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,000
That's against their interest,
what they want.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,200
They want obedient workers,
obedient workers,

24
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,303
people who are just smart enough to run 
the machines and do the paperwork and 

25
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:22,754
just dumb enough to passively accept all
these increasingly shittier jobs with 

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,213
lower pay,
the longer hours to reduce benefits to 

27
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:31,250
the end of overtime and the vanishing 
pension.

28
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,084
That disappears the minute you go to 
collect it and now they're coming for 

29
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:35,444
your social security money.
They want you to fucking retirement 

30
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:38,894
money.
They wanted back so they can give it to 

31
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:43,700
their criminal friends on Wall Street 
and you know something.

32
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,563
They'll get it.
They'll get it all from you sooner or 

33
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,200
later because they own this fucking 
place.

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,350
It's a big club and you ain't in it.
You and I are not in the big club by the

35
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:57,650
way.
It's the same big club they used to beat

36
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:58,484
you over the head with all day long.
When they tell you what to believe all 

37
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,843
day long,
beaten over the head and their media 

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,060
telling you what to believe,
what they think and what to buy.

39
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,620
The table is tilted,
folks,

40
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,770
the game is rigged.

41
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,490
Nobody seems to notice.
Nobody seems to care.

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,251
Good,
honest,

43
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:19,410
hard working.
People continue to elect these rich cock

44
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:21,290
suckers who don't give a fuck about 
them.

45
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,430
It's called the American dream because 
you have to be asleep to believe it.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,120
Things are nothing more than ordinary 
jungle beast savages.

47
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,180
No different from a cro.
Magnon people live 25,000

48
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:37,510
years ago on the place to seem forest 
seat and grubs off a rotten logs,

49
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,553
no different.
Our DNA hasn't changed substantially in 

50
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,040
100,000
years.

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,110
We're still operating out of the lower 
brain.

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,290
The reptilian brain fight or flight,
kill or be killed.

53
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,543
Now we like to think we've evolved in 
advance because we can build a computer 

54
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,550
flying airplane,
travel underwater.

55
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,730
We can write a sonnet painter painting,
composed an opera,

56
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,970
but you know something.
We're out of the jungle on this planet,

57
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,550
barely out of the fucking jungle.
What we are is semis,

58
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,110
civilized beast with baseball caps and 
automatic weapons.

59
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,183
It just seems to me,
seems to me that only a really low Iq 

60
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,810
population could have taken this 
beautiful continent,

61
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,860
this magnificent American landscape that
we inherited.

62
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,773
Well,
actually we stole it from the Mexicans 

63
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,670
and the Indians,
but hey,

64
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,070
it was nice.
One we stolen.

65
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,023
Only a nation of unenlightened halfwits 
could could've taken this beautiful 

66
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:34,210
place and turned it into what it is 
today.

67
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,620
A shopping mall I'll after mile of ball 
after ball.

68
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,880
Many,
many malls,

69
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:42,880
major malls in mini malls.
They put the mini malls in between their

70
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:43,714
major malls and then between the many 
walls they put them in the marts and 

71
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:47,620
then between the mini marts you got the 
car,

72
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,790
lots,
gas stations,

73
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,200
muffler shops,
laundromats,

74
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,570
cheap hotels,
fast food joint strip clubs,

75
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:54,520
and dirty bookstores.
America,

76
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,354
the beautiful one,
big transcontinental commercial 

77
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,943
cesspool.
And how did the people feel about all 

78
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,364
this?
How do people feel about living in a 

79
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,340
coast to coast shopping mall?
Well,

80
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,700
they think it's just fucking Dan.

81
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,583
Dave,

82
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,390
they think it is cool as can be because 
Americans love the mall.

83
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,373
They love the wall.
That's where they get to satisfy their 

84
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,540
two most prominent addictions.
At the same time,

85
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,733
shopping and eating.
We got to be the most interesting 

86
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:21,974
critters on the planet,
and then we wonder why Ufo doesn't just 

87
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:27,080
land and say hello.
