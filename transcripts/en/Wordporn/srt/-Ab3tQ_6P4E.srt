1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,280
When I retired from boxing,
I really don't know.

2
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:09,200
I want to say something right here.
You all might.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,370
This might make you all thing.
Life is not really long.

4
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:15,500
Let's say the average person,
30 years old,

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,240
if you're 30 years old,
you and not been about seven years old,

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,210
I cannot prove it.
Had above the seven,

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,410
eight,
nine hours.

8
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:25,244
You slept for 30 years out of 30 years 
out of bothered the last night when you 

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,510
went to bed and woke up this morning and
you don't remember a thing.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,290
You've built a conscience about eight 
years.

11
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,720
If you're 30 years old,
you strap at eight years.

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,330
Okay.
How much traveling have you done it?

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,173
Thirty years.
The television station to home to 

14
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:48,350
another country,
to another city,

15
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:49,790
to school,
to church.

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,163
You've probably traveled two years in 
life was spent just getting back and 

17
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:54,860
forth to where you're going.

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,040
So there's eight years of sleeping,
two years of traveling.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,640
That's 30 years out.
He liked before you're accomplishing the

20
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:02,540
thing.
How long do you sit in school?

21
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,374
In America,
we stayed in school from the twelfth 

22
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,300
grade,
so from first grade to twelfth grade.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,400
Same here,
virtually it's six hours a day,

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,230
six hours a day for 12 years.
Break it down.

25
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,470
You sit in the classroom for three years
without leaving.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,710
Okay.
Two years of traveling,

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
eight years of sleeping.
Fie years of school.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,210
How many moons right you went to?
How much?

29
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,480
How many movie theaters?
Live plays,

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,420
baseball games.
Probably two years of entertainment.

31
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,523
So by the town of Man,
you older people bear witness to what 

32
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:38,940
I'm saying,
but the time you have children,

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,270
by the time you have made a way for your
children,

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,870
for the time you've paid for your home,
you pushing 60 years old.

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,210
Life is real short.
So yeah,

36
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,890
Paul,
you're traveling at a ball.

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,390
You sleeping at a school,
at a ball unit team,

38
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,020
you probably been half your life doing 
that and so what am I out?

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,590
I'm 35 years old.
Thirty more years.

40
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:04,680
I'll be 65.
We don't have no more influence.

41
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,783
We can't do nothing.
Much of 65 wife will tell you that when 

42
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,590
you're 65,
when you're 65,

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,450
eight.
Too much more to do.

44
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,870
So I'll be 65 and 30 more years in those
30 years after sleep.

45
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:22,314
Nine years.
I don't have 30 years of daylight after 

46
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,370
travel back in America,
take six,

47
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:27,204
seven miles.
All my traveling probably four years of 

48
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:31,240
traveling.
Next 30 years.

49
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,660
About nine years of sleeping television,
movies,

50
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:35,494
and the pain.
About three years of entertainment out 

51
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,630
of 30 years.
I might have about 16 years.

52
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,370
So it's how we can all break 
individualize them.
