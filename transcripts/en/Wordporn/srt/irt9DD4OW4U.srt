1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,283
No,
I've actually always found something to 

2
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:07,694
be very true,
which is most people don't get those 

3
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:11,924
experiences because they never ask.
I've never found anybody that didn't 

4
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:18,170
want to help me.
If I asked him for help,

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,150
I always call him up.
I called up,

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,243
this will date me,
but I called up Bill Hewlett when I was 

7
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:24,674
12 years old and he lived in Palo Alto,
was number was still on the phone book 

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,420
and he answered the phone himself.
Yes.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,620
Hi,
I'm Steve Jobs.

10
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:34,370
I'm 12 years old.
I am a student in high school and I want

11
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:35,204
to build a frequency counter and I was 
wondering if you had any spare parts I 

12
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:39,014
could have and he laughed and he gave me
the spare parts to build this frequency 

13
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:43,640
counter.
Any gave me a job.

14
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:46,070
That summary,
you look Packard working on the assembly

15
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:46,904
line,
putting nuts and bolts together on 

16
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:49,130
frequency counters.

17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,963
He got me a job in a place that 
girlfriend and I was in heaven and I've 

18
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:57,710
never found anyone who said no or hung 
up the phone when I call.

19
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,710
I just asked.
And when people ask me,

20
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:02,770
I try to be as responsive.
You have to pay that,

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,240
that debt of gratitude back.
Um,

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,020
most people never pick up the phone and 
call,

23
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:09,854
and most people never ask.
And that's what separates sometimes the 

24
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:14,710
people to do things from the people that
just dream about them.

25
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,530
Gotta be you gotta Act and you've got to
be willing to fail.

26
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,300
You've got to be willing to crash and 
burn,

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,550
you know,
with people on the phone with starting a

28
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:27,920
company with whatever.
If you're afraid of failing,

29
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,383
you won't get very far.
