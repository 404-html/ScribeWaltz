00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,160
Ms Seven years after my graduation day,
I had failed on an epic scale,

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,913
an exceptionally short lift.
Marriage had imploded and I was jobless 

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,310
alone parent and as poor as it is 
possible to be in modern Britain without

4
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:25,720
being homeless.
The fears that my parents had had for me

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,260
and that I had had for myself had both 
come to pass and by every usual standard

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,540
I was the biggest failure.
I knew.

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,310
Now I'm not going to stand here and tell
you that failure is fun.

8
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,223
That period of my life was a dark one 
and I had no idea that there was going 

9
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:45,754
to be what the press has said since 
represented as a kind of fairy tale 

10
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:50,494
resolution.
I have no idea then how far the tunnel 

11
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:54,964
extended and for a long time any light 
at the end of it was a hope rather than 

12
00:00:58,871 --> 00:00:59,704
a reality.

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,780
So why do I talk about the benefits of 
failure?

14
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:06,843
Simply because failure,
mental stripping away of the 

15
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:10,354
inessential,
I stopped pretending to myself that I 

16
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:14,494
was anything other than what I was and 
began to direct all my energy into 

17
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:19,864
finishing.
The only work that mattered to me had I 

18
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:23,464
really succeeded at anything else,
I might never have found the 

19
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:30,340
determination to succeed in the one 
arena where I believed I truly belonged.

20
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,253
I was set free because my greatest fear 
had been realized and I was still alive 

21
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,683
and I still had a daughter whom I adored
and I had an old typewriter and a big 

22
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:43,594
idea,
and so rock bottom became the solid 

23
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:51,751
foundation on which I rebuilt my life.
You might never fail on the scale I did,

24
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,060
but some failure in life is inevitable.
It is impossible to live without failing

25
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:01,594
at something unless you live so 
cautiously that you might as well not 

26
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:08,590
have lived at all,
in which case you fail.

27
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,423
By default.
Fadia gave me an inner security that I 

28
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:15,610
have never attained by passing 
examinations.

29
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,230
Failure taught me things about myself 
that I could have learned no other way.

30
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,573
I discovered that I had a strong will 
and more disciplined than I has 

31
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,434
suspected.
I also found out that I had friends 

32
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,900
whose value was truly above the price of
rubis.

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,610
The knowledge that you have emerged 
wiser and stronger from setbacks.

34
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,290
It means that you are ever after secure 
in your ability to survive.

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,113
You will never truly know yourself.
All the strength of your relationships 

36
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,060
until both have been tested by 
adversity.

37
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,010
Such knowledge is a true gift for all 
the titties,

38
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:54,844
painfully one,
and it has been worth more than any 

39
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,350
qualification I ever earned.
