1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,083
So very worried.
Secrecy is repugnant in a free and open 

2
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:12,274
society.
And we are as a people inherently and 

3
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:20,350
historic opposed to secret society to 
secret oats and a secret proceedings.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,113
But we are opposed around the world by a
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that 

5
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,594
relies primarily on cupboard,
means for expanding its sphere of 

6
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:37,231
influence on infiltration instead of 
invasion on severity.

7
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:42,741
And instead of elections on intimidation
instead of free choice.

8
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:44,763
It is a system which has conscripted 
vast human and material resources into 

9
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:50,944
the building of a tightly knit,
highly efficient machine that combines 

10
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,980
military,
diplomatic,

11
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,320
intelligence,
economic,

12
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,080
scientific,
and political operations.

13
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,740
Its preparations are concealed,
not published.

14
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,950
It's mistakes a buried,
not headlined.

15
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,460
Its dissenters are silenced,
not praised.

16
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,240
No expenditure is questioned.
No rumor is printed.

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,643
No secret is revealed.
That is why the Athenian lawmaker solon 

18
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,590
decreed it a crime for any citizen to 
shrink from controversy.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,993
But I am asking your help in the 
tremendous task of informing and 

20
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:32,614
alerting the American people confident 
that with your help man will be what he 

21
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:39,970
was born to be free and ended,

22
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,183
uh.
