1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,453
Who saw the movie,
the Matrix Matrix was banging movie to 

2
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:14,664
me.
And the reason why I appreciated it so 

3
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:21,360
much was because at the end when Neil 
like realize his potential,

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,460
he started to see the binary code.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,520
You remember that?
The whole world.

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,193
That's where I'm trying to be spiritual.
I'm trying to see the word of God and 

7
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:34,720
the whole world's,
every time that agent throws a punch,

8
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:35,800
I'm like,
I see you.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,370
You know,
I'm just catching this patch of,

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,700
you know,
so I don't,

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,700
I'm not afraid.
You know,

12
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:43,570
I'm not afraid because I'm starting to 
see that,

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,130
you know,
things are just,

14
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:48,550
situations materialize themselves and 
he's an agent.

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,013
Here's the trick is that you have to 
remember that sometimes you can be an 

16
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:56,800
agent,
you can be an agent for it to yourself.

17
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,163
You can be an agent against someone else
and not even realize that you're being 

18
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:02,920
used.
You know?

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,740
Let me tell you another thing about the 
matrix.

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,530
I was always confused about it.
I always thought that,

21
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,813
you know,
the Matrix was battling the enemy out 

22
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:13,240
there,
picking them out.

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,490
I'm going to find those enemies,
get that enemy.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,670
Until I realized that until you 
conquered the enemy and yourself,

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,290
you can't deal with anyone.
In order to be used by God,

26
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,150
you have to really be used.
You know,

27
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,190
we always want to be used for the 
glorious jobs.

28
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,083
Look,
God put me on a stage in front of the 

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,950
people in the grammy show with a nice 
dress on.

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,793
Let me just praise your name.
But that's not being used sometimes in 

31
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:37,510
order to be used,
you also have to be humiliated.

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,693
It's be humiliated.
Sometimes you have to be kicked and 

33
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:45,970
beaten,
and in that situation,

34
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,720
the person who was kicking and beating,
he's feeling more pain than you are.

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,570
You know,
love is,

36
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,840
is an incredible thing,
and we don't know love like we should.

37
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,420
We always talk about,
I have unconditional love.

38
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,530
Unconditional love is we don't even know
it because if a person stops stimulating

39
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:03,580
us,
we stop loving them.

40
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,220
You're not interesting to talk to 
anymore.

41
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,070
Goodbye.
But that real love,

42
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,390
that love that sometimes it's difficult,
difficult to have.

43
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,810
That's that love and that's a confidence
builder.

44
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,473
Okay.
