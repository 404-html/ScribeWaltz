1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,990
Specify your goal.
If you do that,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,140
you do that in some sense as a unique 
individual.

3
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:10,974
You want to.
You want to specify goals that make you 

4
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:13,500
say,
Oh,

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,410
if that could happen as a consequence of
my efforts,

6
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,920
it would clearly be worthwhile because 
the question always is,

7
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,470
why do something?
Because doing nothing is easy.

8
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:24,810
You just sit there and you don't do 
anything that's real easy.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,943
The question is why would you ever do 
anything and the answer that has to be 

10
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,514
because you've determined by some means 
that it's worthwhile and then the next 

11
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:34,320
question might be,
well,

12
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:36,990
where should you look for worthwhile 
things and one would be,

13
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:37,824
well,
you could consult your own temperament 

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,820
and the other would be while you kinda 
look at how.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,650
Look at what it is that people accrue 
that's valuable across the lifespan.

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,963
Look,
look what so you do a structural 

17
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:53,730
analysis of the sub components of human 
existence and already did that.

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,193
You need a family.
You need friends like you don't need to 

19
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:58,710
have all of these things,
but you better have most of them.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,851
Family,
friends,

21
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,040
career,
educational goals,

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,963
plans for time outside of work,
attention to your mental and physical 

23
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:07,824
health,
etc.

24
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,840
You know those are,
that's what life is about.

25
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,570
And if You don't have any of those 
things,

26
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:15,150
well then all you've got left is misery 
and suffering,

27
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:18,990
so that's a bad,
that's a bad deal for you.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,050
So,
so once you,

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,480
once you set up that,
that goal structure,

30
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,390
let's say,
and that's really in many in many ways,

31
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:29,560
that's what you should be doing at 
universities is,

32
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,570
that's exactly what you should

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,620
you're doing is trying to figure out who
it is that you're trying to be,

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,473
right?
And you aim at that and then use 

35
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,564
everything you learn as a means of 
building that person that you want to 

36
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:43,314
be.
And,

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,633
and I really mean want to be.
I don't mean should be even those 

38
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:47,574
things,
those things are going to overlap and 

39
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,020
it's important to distinguish between 
those because that's partly,

40
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,240
and this is back down to the micro 
routine analysis.

41
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:54,991
So ashley is saying,
well,

42
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,700
you're going to try to make yourself 
more industrious.

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,661
Okay?
Number one,

44
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:58,494
specify your damn goals because how are 
you going to hit something if you don't 

45
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:02,700
know what it is that isn't going to 
happen,

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,893
and often people won't specify their 
goals too because they don't like to 

47
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:06,834
specify conditions for failure.
So if you keep yourself all vague and 

48
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,150
foggy,
which is real easy because that's just a

49
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,530
matter of not doing as well.

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,500
Then you don't know when you fail and 
people might say,

51
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:17,334
well,
I really don't want to know when I fail 

52
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:19,650
because that's painful,
so I'll,

53
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:21,960
I'll keep myself blind about when I 
fail.

54
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,150
ThAt's fine,
except you'll fail all the time.

55
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,960
Then you just won't know it until you 
failed so badly that you're done.

56
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,600
And that can easily happen by the time 
you're 40.

57
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,303
So.
So I would recommend that you don't let 

58
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,240
that happen.
So that's willful blindness,

59
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,440
right?
You could have known,

60
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,540
but you chose not to.
Okay?

61
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,490
So once you get your goal structure set 
up,

62
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:42,061
you think,
okay,

63
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,510
if I could have this life looks like 
that might be worth living,

64
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,344
despite the fact that it's going to be 
anxiety provoking and threatening and 

65
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:52,050
there's gonna be some suffering and loss
involved in all of that.

66
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,183
Obviously the goal is to to have a 
vision for your life such that all 

67
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:00,610
things considered that justifies your 
effort.

68
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,770
Okay.
So then what do you do?

69
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,150
Well then then you turn down to the 
micro routines,

70
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,641
just like,
okay,

71
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:10,810
well this is what I'm aiming for.
How does that instantiates itself day to

72
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:11,650
day,
week to week,

73
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,484
month to month.
And that's where something like a 

74
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:16,720
schedule can be unbelievably useful.
Google calendar.

75
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,690
It's like naked damn schedule and stick 
to it.

76
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,850
Okay.
So what's the rule with the schedule?

77
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,520
It's not a bloody prison.
That's the first thing that peter,

78
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:25,560
I

79
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,311
will do wrong.
He said,

80
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:28,590
well I don't like to follow a schedule 
once,

81
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:29,424
like,
well what kind of schedule are you 

82
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:31,200
setting up?
Well I,

83
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,300
I have to do this,
then I have to do this,

84
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,830
then I have to do this,
you know?

85
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:35,664
And then I just go play video games 
because he wants to do all these things 

86
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:39,590
that I have to do.
It's like wrong.

87
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,890
Set the damn schedule up so that you 
have the day you want.

88
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,600
That's the trick.
It's like,

89
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:46,770
okay,
I've got tomorrow.

90
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,813
If I was going to set it up so it was 
the best possible day I could have 

91
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,570
practically speaking,
what would it look like?

92
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,973
Well then you schedule that and 
obviously there's a bit of 

93
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,990
responsibility that's going to go along 
with that because if you have any sense,

94
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,093
one of the things that you're gonna 
insist upon is that at the end of the 

95
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,633
day,
you're not in worse shape than you were 

96
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,910
then at the beginning of the day,
right?

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,300
Because that's a stupid day.
If you have a bunch of those in a row,

98
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,280
you just dig,
dig yourself a hole,

99
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:15,990
and then you bury yourself in.
It's like,

100
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,120
sorry,
that's just not a good strategy.

101
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,313
It's a bad strategy.
So maybe 20 percent of your day has to 

102
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,290
be responsibility and obligation,
or maybe it's more than that,

103
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,140
depending on how far behind you are.
But even that you can,

104
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,580
you can ask yourself,
okay,

105
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:33,450
well I've got these responsibilities,
I have to schedule the damn things in.

106
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,020
What's the right ratio of responsibility
to reward?

107
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,123
And you can ask yourself that just like 
you'd negotiate with someone who is 

108
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:41,250
working for you.
It's like,

109
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,270
okay,
you gotta work tomorrow.

110
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,970
Okay,
so I want you to work tomorrow.

111
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:45,781
And you might say,
okay,

112
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:46,614
well what are you going to do for me 
that makes it likely that I'll work for 

113
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:52,140
you while you could ask yourself that,
you know,

114
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,423
maybe you do an hour of,
of responsibility and then you play a 

115
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:57,300
video game for 15 minutes.

116
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,310
I don't know,
whatever turns your crank man.

117
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:00,144
but you know,
you have to negotiate with yourself and 

118
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:03,264
not tyrannized yourself like you're 
negotiating with someone that you care 

119
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,930
for that you would like to be productive
and have a good life.

120
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:11,880
And,
and that's how you make the schedule.

121
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:12,714
It's like.
And then you look at the day and you 

122
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:13,741
think,
well,

123
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:15,240
if I had that day,
that'd be good.

124
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,100
Great.
You know,

125
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:18,630
and you,
you're useless and horrible.

126
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:21,510
So you'll probably only hit it with 
about 70 percent accuracy,

127
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:24,690
but that beats the hell out of zero,
right?

128
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,270
And if you hit it even with 50 percent 
accuracy,

129
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,433
another rule is well,
aim for 51 percent the next week or 50 

130
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:32,424
and a half percent for god's sake or 
because you're going to hit that 

131
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:41,390
position where things start to loop back
positively and spiral you upward and so,

132
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,063
so that's one way that you can work on 
your conscientiousness is a plan a life 

133
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:46,854
you'd like to have,
and you do that partly by referring to 

134
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:53,520
social norms.
That'S more or less rescuing your father

135
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,354
from the belly of the whale,
but the other way you do that is by 

136
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,490
having a little with yourself

137
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,323
about as if you don't really know who 
you are because you know what you're 

138
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:03,530
like.
You won't do what you're told.

139
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,930
You won't do what you tell yourself to 
do.

140
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,063
You must have noticed that.
It's like you're a bad employee and a 

141
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:13,640
worse boss and both of those work for 
you.

142
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,420
You don't know what you want to do and 
then when you tell yourself what to do,

143
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,273
you don't do it anyways.
You should fire yourself and find 

144
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,460
someone else to beat.
But,

145
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,460
but you know,
my point is,

146
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,880
is that you have to understand that 
you're not your own servant,

147
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:26,714
so to speak.
You're someone that you have to 

148
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,304
negotiate with and that's.
And you're someone that you want to 

149
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,370
present the opportunity of having a good
life too.

150
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,250
And that's hard for people because they 
don't like themselves very much.

151
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,953
so you know,
they're always like cracking the whip 

152
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,114
and then procrastinating and cracking 
the whip and then procrastinating and 

153
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:48,080
it's like so boring and such a pathetic 
way of spending your time.

154
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,370
And you know what that's like because he
probably wasted like six hours a day and

155
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:51,670
I think

156
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,190
we did an economic calculation about 
that awhile back.

157
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:55,024
Right?
Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an 

158
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:57,610
hour,
something like that.

159
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,590
I mean,
you're not getting paid that now,

160
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,633
but you're young.
and so this is investment time and what 

161
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:06,190
you do now is going to multiply its 
effects in the future.

162
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:08,440
So,
so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour,

163
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:09,274
which is perfectly reasonable.
So if you waste six hours a day and you 

164
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:13,930
are,
then you're wasting about $2,000

165
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:15,790
a week or about $100,000
a year.

166
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,624
So like go ahead.
But that's what it's costing you every 

167
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,250
hour and you need to know what your damn
time is worth.

168
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,620
So let's say it's not 50 bucks,
it's 30,

169
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,690
whatever.
Maybe it's a hundred.

170
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:26,524
It's somewhere in that range.
One of the things that you should be 

171
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:31,120
asking yourself is when you spend an 
hour was that,

172
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:31,954
well,
what have I paid someone 50 bucks to 

173
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:36,220
have had that hour?
And if that answer is no,

174
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:37,054
it's like,
well maybe you should do something else 

175
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:38,824
with your time.
and it depends on whether or not you 

176
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:41,404
think that your time is worthwhile.
But the funny thing about not assuming 

177
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,750
that is if you assume your time isn't 
worthwhile,

178
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,153
what happens is you don't just sit 
around sort of randomly in a state of 

179
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,300
responsibility lists bliss.
What you do is you suffer existentially.
