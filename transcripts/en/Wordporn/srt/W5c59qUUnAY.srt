1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,193
From this distance vantage point might,
let's see him have any particular 

2
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:13,510
interest,
but for us it's different.

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,200
Consider again that dot that's here.
That's home.

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,080
That's us on it.
Everyone you love,

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,130
everyone you know,
everyone you ever heard of,

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,270
every human being who ever was lived out
their lives,

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,530
the aggregate or joy and suffering.
Thousands of confident religions,

8
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:43,490
ideologies and economic doctrines.
Every hunter and forager,

9
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,163
every hero and coward,
every Creator and destroyer of 

10
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,870
civilization,
every Kenyan peasant,

11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,740
every young couple in love,
every mother and father,

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,560
hopeful child,
inventor and explorer.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,220
Every teacher of morals,
corrupt politician,

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,450
every superstar,
every supreme leader,

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,733
every saint and sinner in the history of
our species lived there on the dust 

16
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,763
suspended in a sunbeam.
The earth is a very small stage in a 

17
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:22,714
fast cosmic arena.
Think of the rivers of blood spilled by 

18
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:30,244
all those generals and emperors so that 
in glorious triumph they could become 

19
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:39,760
the momentary masters of a fraction of a
dot.

20
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:45,610
Think of the endless cruelties visited 
by the inhabitants of one corner of this

21
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:50,611
pixel on the scarcely distinguishable 
inhabitants of some other corner.

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,820
How frequent their misunderstanding,
how eager they are to kill one another.

23
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,490
How fervent their hatreds,
our posturings,

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,593
our imagined self importance.
The delusion that we have some 

25
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:12,841
privileged position in the universe are 
challenged by this point of Pale light.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,353
Our planet.
He's a luminary Spec in the great 

27
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,970
enveloping cosmic dark,
you know,

28
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:24,804
are obscurity in all this vastness.
There is no hint that help will come 

29
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:34,780
from elsewhere to save us from 
ourselves.

30
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,220
The earth is the only world known so far
to harbor life.

31
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,890
There is nowhere else,
at least in the near future to which our

32
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:46,650
species could migrate.
Visit,

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,230
yes,
settle.

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,420
Not yet like it or not.
For the moment,

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,913
the earth is where we make our stand.
It has been said that astronomy is a 

36
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,220
humbling and character building 
experience.

37
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,050
There is perhaps no better demonstration
of the folly of human conceits.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,100
Then this distance image of our tiny 
world,

39
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,133
to me,
it underscores our responsibility to 

40
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:22,051
deal more kindly with one another and to
preserve and cherish the pale blue dot.

41
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,530
The only home we've ever known him.
