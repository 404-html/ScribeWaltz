1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,770
So many creative people talk about the 
importance

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,530
failure in,
right?

3
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:14,520
The fact that it's okay to make mistakes
during the creative process.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,090
Then to do anything creative,
you've got to take a risk.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,190
Some kind of cognitive disinhibition is 
necessary.

6
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,024
You need to cross the streams.
You need to cross the wires just a 

7
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,004
little bit,
right?

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,010
A little bit of madness is necessary to 
connect the dots in a new way.

9
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:36,684
Right?
Isaiah Berlin famously said to 

10
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:43,821
understand is to perceive patterns.
That's in essence what creativity is.

11
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:46,890
Steve Jobs says creativity is just 
connecting things,

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,113
but in order to see patterns and rather 
in order to recombine existing patterns 

13
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,804
into new forms and new shapes,
you need to be willing to blur the 

14
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:00,270
boundaries between your thoughts,
right?

15
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:04,620
To be an associational thinker,
right to free style,

16
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:08,130
to ride a butterfly effecting thought,
but again,

17
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:10,710
most of the time we play it safe,
right?

18
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,020
We map out what we're going to say.

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,320
We preplan what we're going to do.
We make a list.

20
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:18,480
We have a set of steps.
We are prepared,

21
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:22,830
we've pre scripted ours beach or we are 
responsible.

22
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:26,940
We're not going into a situation blind,
but again,

23
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,380
once in a while,
my friends,

24
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,530
we need to be willing to make a mistake.
We need to be willing to fail.

25
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:32,364
It is only when we risk making a mistake
that we might find ourselves 

26
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,820
improvising,
inventing,

27
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,400
innovating our way back to where we want
to get to.

28
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:46,401
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Think of this rant as a metaphor for the

29
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:47,880
creative process,
right?

30
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,390
I have some what,
an idea of what I want to say,

31
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,224
right?
It's related to creativity and it's 

32
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:56,970
related to cognitive disinhibition and 
being willing to make a mistake.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,410
That's all I know.
Then I start jamming about this and what

34
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:06,210
happens is I might lose myself in some 
chain of thought,

35
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:06,540
right?

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,790
I just kind of lose myself in the 
moment.

37
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,910
The metaphor might like confound me and 
before I know it,

38
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:12,744
I don't even remember what I was saying,
but somehow that's when the creativity 

39
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:18,600
kicks in because somehow I've got to 
bring it back.

40
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:21,780
I've got a rope it in,
I've got to remember where I'm going.

41
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,690
I've got a summon coherence,
right?

42
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,380
Then the Bardos between one statement 
and the other.

43
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,740
And in doing so and in risking screwing 
up the video and the tape,

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,490
it is in that risk that the courage,
that the innovation,

45
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:43,491
that the creativity that the original 
thought might emerge and usually does.

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,650
And before I know it,
I've landed and I feel like,

47
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:47,490
wow,
man,

48
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,590
I just took a trip,
man.

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,490
You know,
I just sailed into the great unknown and

50
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:55,320
I brought it back.
And here we are.

51
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,420
That is what creativity is all about.

52
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,600
That is the risk.
That is the willingness to fail and make

53
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,930
a mistake that is crucial to the 
creative process.

54
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,880
So the wall,
my fellow thinkers,

55
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,960
writers,
painters,

56
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,973
poets,
original doors out in the world trying 

57
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,724
to come up with an original vision,
trying to impact humanity through their 

58
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,590
art and their artistry.
Go forth,

59
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,980
but be willing to fail,
be willing to make a mistake,

60
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,520
pick up the pieces and try,
uh,

61
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,340
yeah,
it is a ride and we're in it together.

62
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,174
My friends,
and if we have each other and respect 

63
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,960
each other and tolerate each other's 
failures and failings,

64
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,690
we will get to a much better,
much higher,

65
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,900
much more holy place.
And isn't that awesome?
