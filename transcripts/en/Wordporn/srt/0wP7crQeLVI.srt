1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,943
Well,
now really when we go back then to 

2
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:13,061
falling in love and say it's crazy 
falling.

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,070
See,
we don't say rising into love,

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,080
isn't it?
The idea of the fall and uh,

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,290
it is,
goes back.

6
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:30,110
As a matter of fact,
two extremely fundamental things that,

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,740
that is always a curious it at some 
point between the fall and the creation.

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,240
Taking this gosling risk is the 
condition of that being live you see for

9
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:57,521
all life is an act of faith and an act 
of gamble.

10
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,733
The moment you take a step,
you will do so on an act of faith 

11
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:07,860
because you don't really know that the 
flaw is not going to give unto your feet

12
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,910
the limits.
You take a journey.

13
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,803
What an act of faith.
The moment you enter into any kind of 

14
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,170
Hulan undertaking in relationship,
what an act of faith.

15
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,830
See you've given yourself up.
But this is the most powerful thing that

16
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:25,900
can be done.
Surrender.

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,950
See I love is an act of surrender to 
another person.

18
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,960
Total abandonment.
I give myself to you,

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,873
take me through anything you like when 
you see so that's quite mad because you 

20
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,980
see it's letting things get out of 
control.

21
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,950
All sensible people keep things in 
control.

22
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,890
Watch it,
watch it,

23
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,360
watch it.
Security vigilance,

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,633
watching police watch it.
God's watching who's going to watch the 

25
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:07,620
gods?
So actually,

26
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,511
therefore the,
the,

27
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:11,790
the cost of wisdom.
What is really a sensible,

28
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,500
uh,
is to let go,

29
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,110
is to commit oneself,
to give oneself up.

30
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:16,944
And that's quite mad.
So we come to the strange conclusion 

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,450
that in madness lies sanity.
