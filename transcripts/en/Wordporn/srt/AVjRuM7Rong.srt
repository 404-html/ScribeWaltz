1
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,120
Young man,
why aren't you eating that fish?

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,893
Fish you love to fish.
That's why you took it out of the water 

3
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:19,170
and killed it and boiled it.
He says,

4
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:20,004
don't tell me you love the fish.
You love yourself and because the fish 

5
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,234
tastes good to you,
therefore you took it out of the water 

6
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:32,061
and killed it and boiled it so much of 
what his love is.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,840
Fish off,
right and so young.

8
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,270
Couple of falls in love,
young man,

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,810
young woman falling in love.
What does that mean?

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,873
That means that he saw in this woman 
someone who we felt could provide him 

11
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,270
with knowledge,
just physical and emotional needs,

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,313
and she thought this meant somebody.
She feels that she can write that was 

13
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:53,484
love,
but each one is looking out for their 

14
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:57,600
own needs.
It's not love for the other.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,280
The other person becomes a vehicle for,
for my gratification,

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,060
too much of what is called love is fish.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,140
Love external love is man on what I'm 
going to get,

18
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:10,974
but what I'm going to get.
We had an ethicist rabbi Tessler who 

19
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,144
said,
people make a serious mistake in 

20
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:21,980
thinking that you give to those who 
love.

21
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,110
The answer is.
The real answer is you love those too,

22
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,550
and this point is if I give something to
you,

23
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,610
I've invested myself in you and seeing 
this self love is a given.

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,353
Everybody loves themselves.
Now that part of me has become a new 

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,560
right.
There's part of me knew that I love true

26
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,560
love is a love of giving and receiving.
