1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,003
Your life is your life.
Don't let it be gloved into dank 

2
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:10,864
submission.
You're always out there is a lion to 

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,440
somewhere.
It may not be much lighter,

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,820
but it beats the darkness beyond the 
watch.

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,850
The gods will offer you chances.
No.

6
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:33,450
Then say time.
He can beat death,

7
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:38,451
but he can beat death in life sometimes,
and the more often you learn to do it,

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,340
the more lines that would be your life 
while you have it.

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,390
You are marvelous.
The God's way.
