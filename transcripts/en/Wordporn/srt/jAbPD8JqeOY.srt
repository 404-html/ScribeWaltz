1
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,620
Sadly,
sadly,

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,820
we live in a state of fear.
Every day we hear on the news,

3
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,890
on the radio and television and the 
newspapers always of war.

4
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,520
We hear of nations hurting each other,
of neighbors hurting each other.

5
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,413
Uh,
families hurting each other and the 

6
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,114
children killing each other.
We must learn to live and love each 

7
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:51,410
other before it's too late.
We have to stop.

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,420
We have to stop the prejudice.
We have to stop the Haiti.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,550
We have to stop living in fear of our 
own neighbors.

10
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,703
I would like all of you now to take the 
hand of the person to the left and to 

11
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,570
the right of you.
Go ahead right now.

12
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,070
I mean it.
Don't be shy.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,380
Do it cause it starts now to the person 
next to you to the left and the right.

14
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,290
I mean it right now.
Go ahead.

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,480
Don't be shy.
Do it.

16
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,380
Do it now.
Tell the person,

17
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,370
tell the person next to you that you 
care for them.

18
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,923
Tell them that you love them.
This is what makes the difference 

19
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,883
together.
We can make a change in the world 

20
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,170
together.
We can help to stop racism together.

21
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:46,160
We can help to stop prejudice.
We can help the world live without fear.

22
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,810
It is our only hope.
Without hope we are lost.

23
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,653
Yeah.
