1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,080
What do you see?
I think we all work too much.

2
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:07,914
I think we've been,
we've been brainwashed into being that 

3
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:13,434
we have to spend all our lives working.
We never used to do that now before the 

4
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,180
industrial revolution.
I mean,

5
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:19,460
one would sort of,
you know,

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,220
the Irish for instance,
they would plant the potatoes in the,

7
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:26,040
uh,
I suppose it would be the sort of winter

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,030
in the,
in the ocean.

9
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:27,864
They plant their seed potatoes and then 
they would sit and they would drink and 

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,630
they would sing and they would eat and 
they would wait for the potatoes to come

11
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:36,900
up.
And then,

12
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,460
you know,
that was their life.

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,870
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with it in,

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,420
in Spain,
uh,

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,810
going to sleep for three hours in the 
afternoon.

16
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:48,030
It's wonderful.
It's so civilized.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,700
But we are,
you see,

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,430
the problem is we're,
we're,

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,440
we're told that we're put on this planet
to work and we work from 8:00

20
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,160
in the morning till 5:00
at night or whatever.

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,623
And,
and if we're lucky we have a Saturday 

22
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,160
off and Sunday off and then we can go 
and buy things.

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,260
But I don't think that's how life should
be for all bankrupt.

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,010
We all owe billions of dollars and 
billions of whatevers to somebody.

25
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:17,844
I'm not sure who it is we owe it to.
But then somebody out there who's a who 

26
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:22,980
must be really pissed off.
