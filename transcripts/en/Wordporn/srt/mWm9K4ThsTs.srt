1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,970
How many hours a day you waste or how 
many hours a week do you waste?

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,450
The classic answer is something like 
four to six hours a day.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,580
You know,
inefficient studying,

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,073
watching things on youtube that not only
do you not want to watch that you don't 

5
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:18,734
even care about that make you feel 
horrible about watching after you're 

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,360
done.
That's probably four hours right there.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,740
No,
what you think,

8
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:27,320
well,
that's 2025 hours a week.

9
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:30,440
It's $100 a month.
That's two and a half full work weeks.

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,620
It's half a year of work weeks per year.
And if your time is worth $20 an hour,

11
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,364
which is a radical undressed,
but it's probably more like 50 if you 

12
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:41,630
think about it in terms of deferred 
wages,

13
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,980
if you're wasting 20 hours a week,
you're wasting $50,000

14
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:49,880
a year and you are doing that right now 
and it's because you're young.

15
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:50,714
Wasting $50,000
a year is a way bigger catastrophe than 

16
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:56,000
it would be for me to waste it because 
I'm not going to last nearly as long.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,280
And so if your life isn't everything,
it could be,

18
00:00:58,281 --> 00:00:59,340
you could ask yourself,
well,

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,403
what would happen if you just stopped 
wasting the opportunities that are in 

20
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,064
front of you?
You'd be who knows how much more 

21
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:08,960
efficient,
10 times more efficient,

22
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,470
20 times more efficient.
That's the prieto distribution.

23
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,770
You have no idea how efficient,
efficient people get.

24
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,933
It's completely,
it's off the charts while and if we all 

25
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:25,280
got her act together collectively and 
stopped making things worse,

26
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:27,530
because that's another thing people do 
all the time.

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,680
Not only do they not do what they should
to make things better,

28
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,663
they actively attempt to make things 
worse because they're spiteful or 

29
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:34,934
resentful or arrogant or deceitful or or
homicidal or genocidal or all of those 

30
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:45,260
things all bundled together in an 
absolutely pathological package.

31
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,490
If people stopped really,
really trying just to make things worse,

32
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,520
we have no idea how much better they 
would get just because of that.

33
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,253
So there's this weird dynamic that's 
part of the existential system of ideas 

34
00:01:57,561 --> 00:02:00,740
between human vulnerability,
social judgment,

35
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,960
both of which are are,
are,

36
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,123
are major causes of suffering and the 
failure of individuals to adopt the 

37
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:10,190
responsibility that they know they 
should adopt.

38
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,270
And that's the thing that's interesting 
too is that I know like one of the,

39
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:17,780
another thing I've asked often ask my 
undergraduate classes is,

40
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,730
you know,
there's this idea that,

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
that people have that people have a 
conscience.

42
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,190
You know what the conscience is.
It's,

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,353
it's this feeling or voice you have in 
your head just before you do something 

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,393
that you know is stupid telling you that
probably you shouldn't do that stupid 

45
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,460
thing.
You don't have to listen to it strangely

46
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,294
enough.
But you go ahead and do it anyways and 

47
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:41,240
then,
Oh of course,

48
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,074
exactly what the conscience told you was
going to happen inevitably happen so 

49
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:45,704
that you'll feel even stupider about it 
then you would if it happened by 

50
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:48,490
accident.

51
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,110
Cause you know,
I knew this was going to happen.

52
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,770
I got a warning it was going to happen 
and I went and did it anyways.

53
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:58,100
And the funny thing too is that that 
conscience operates within people and we

54
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:00,310
really don't understand the hell that 
is.

55
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,620
So you might say,
well,

56
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,454
what would happen if you abided by your 
conscience for five years or for 10 

57
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,530
years?
What sort of position might you be in?

58
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,364
What sort of family might you have?
What sort of relationship might you be 

59
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,754
able to forge?
And you can be bloody sure that a 

60
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:19,591
relationship that's forged on the basis 
of who you actually are is going to be a

61
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:20,674
lot stronger and more welcome than one 
that's forged on the basis of who you 

62
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,380
aren't.
Now of course that means that the person

63
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,214
you're with has to deal with the full 
force of you in all your ability and 

64
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:34,660
your catastrophe and that's a very,
very difficult thing to negotiate.

65
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,590
But if you do negotiate it well at least
you have something,

66
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,830
you have somewhere solid to stand and 
you have somewhere to live.

67
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:42,664
You have a real life and it's a great 
basis upon which to bring children into 

68
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:47,830
the world,
for example,

69
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:48,664
because you can have an actual 
relationship with them instead of 

70
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,030
torturing them half to death,
which is what happens in a tremendous,

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,130
a tremendously large minority of cases.
Well,

72
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,770
it's more than that too because,
and this is what I'll close with,

73
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,680
and this is why I wanted to introduce 
social knutson's writings to you.

74
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:06,514
You see,
because it isn't merely that your fate 

75
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:10,444
depends on whether or not you get your 
act together and to what degree you 

76
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:17,050
decide that you're going to live out 
your own genuine being.

77
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:17,884
It isn't only your fate,
it's the fate of everyone that you're 

78
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,390
networked with.
And so you know,

79
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,224
you think,
well,

80
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,663
there's 9 billion,
7 billion people in the world are going 

81
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:30,610
to peak at about 9 billion by the way,
and then it'll decline rapidly,

82
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:33,190
but 7 billion people in the world,
and who are you?

83
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,430
You're just one little dust mote among 
that 7 billion.

84
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,650
And so it really doesn't matter what you
do or don't do,

85
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:39,484
but that's simply not the case.
It's the wrong model because you're at 

86
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:46,300
the center of a network,
you're a node in a network.

87
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,373
Of course,
that's even more true now that we have 

88
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:49,630
social media.
You'll,

89
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,990
you'll know a thousand people at least 
over the course of your life,

90
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,093
and they'll know a thousand people each,
and that puts you one person away from 

91
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,380
1,000,002
persons away from a billion.

92
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,950
And so that's how you're connected and 
the things you do,

93
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,993
they're like dropping a stone in a pond.
The ripples move outward and the affect 

94
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,480
things in ways that you can't fully 
comprehend,

95
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,314
and it means that the things that you do
and that you don't do are far more 

96
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,790
important than you think.
