00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,300
When I ask you a question is your life's
blueprint,

2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,900
this is the most important and crucial 
period of your life.

3
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,330
What you do now and what you decide now 
at this age may well determine which way

4
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:42,481
your life shall go,
and whenever a building is constructed,

5
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,273
you usually to have an architect who 
draws a blueprint and that blueprint 

6
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:54,554
serves as the pattern as the guy,
as the model for those who are to build 

7
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,553
the building and a building is not well 
erect it without a good sound solid 

8
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,090
blueprint.
Now,

9
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:26,091
each of you is in the process building 
the structure,

10
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,643
have you alive,
and the question is whether you have a 

11
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:42,281
prop or a solid sound blueprint,
and I want to suggest some of the things

12
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:53,600
that should be and your life's 
blueprint.

13
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,350
Number one in your life's blueprint 
should be belief and your own dignity or

14
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:11,584
your own worth and your own.
Somebody this don't allow anybody to 

15
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:23,341
make you feel that you are nobody.
Always feel that you count,

16
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,213
always feel that you have worth,
and I always feel that your life has 

17
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,990
significance.
Don't be ashamed.

18
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,660
Don't be ashamed of your biological 
features.

19
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,050
Somehow you must be able to say in your 
own lives and really believe in,

20
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,180
I am black but beautiful.

21
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,673
Oh yeah.
Your Life's blood that a principal or 

22
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:28,460
somebody in his second lap and your 
life's blueprint.

23
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,220
Okay.

24
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,053
You must have as a basic principle,
they did termination to achieve 

25
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,470
excellence in your various fields in 
that barn.

26
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,230
You're going to be deciding as the days 
and the years what you will do in life,

27
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,930
what your life's work will be.
Yeah.

28
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,050
Once you discover what it will be set 
out to do it and to do it well,

29
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,770
and I say to you,
my young friends,

30
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,780
that opening to each of you know some 
opportunity opening the each of you that

31
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,613
were not open to your mothers and 
fathers and the greatest challenge 

32
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:24,951
facing you is to be ready to enter these
doors as they opened.
