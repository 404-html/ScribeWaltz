1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,180
Sunday school teacher by day and a sex 
addict ignite.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,900
Ooh.
They were like,

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,900
you won't believe it.
We got her going out.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,943
We got her with the men and we get to 
show her and she was willing to show us 

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,443
everything.
I sat down with a woman for the 

6
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:30,601
interview that was taped and during the 
process of the interview I said,

7
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,220
why are you doing this?
And she said,

8
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:35,570
oh,
I want to help people.

9
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:37,610
I want to tell my story and I want to 
help people.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,180
I said,
do you have children?

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,043
She says,
yes,

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,480
I have a 10 year old son.
I knew right then this is never going to

13
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:45,314
see the light of day.
So we got off the air and I said to the 

14
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,020
lady,
we are not going to air that show.

15
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,840
And she said,
why?

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,170
My producer said,
why she knew she was being filmed.

17
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,003
She knew what she was saying.
She knows what I said because her son 

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,870
will never get over it.
You always know it's the right thing.

19
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:09,704
When in the end there was peace.
You are rewarded by peace in knowing 

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,233
that you did the right thing.
The three things that I want to leave 

21
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:26,051
with you will carry you if you let them,
first and foremost,

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,350
knowing who you are,
being able to answer this question,

23
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,563
who am I and what do I want so I'm not 
asking for the roles that you play as a 

24
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,310
daughter,
as a friend,

25
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,410
as a sister.
You're going to be a lawyer.

26
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:48,080
You're going to teach,
you're going to be a pharmacist.

27
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,620
I'm asking the bigger question of who am
I and what do I want?

28
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,450
I don't want to just be successful in 
the world.

29
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,073
I want to fulfill the highest,
truest expression of myself as a human 

30
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,044
being.

31
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,843
I want to fulfill the promise that the 
creator dreamed when he dreamed the 

32
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:20,684
cells that made me.
You must have some kind of vision for 

33
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:30,170
your life.
Even if you don't know the plan.

34
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,590
You have to have a direction in which 
you choose to go.

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,570
You want to be in the driver's seat of 
your own life because if you're not,

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,750
life will drive you.
Number two,

37
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,413
you must find a way to serve.
Martin Luther King said that not 

38
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:52,754
everybody can be famous,
but everybody can be great because 

39
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:59,681
greatness is determined by service.
When you shift the of whatever it is you

40
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:05,140
choose to do to service and you bring 
significance to that,

41
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,980
success will I promise you,
follow you.

42
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,320
That's number two.
Number three,

43
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,080
it's so simple,
but so hard to do.

44
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,520
Always do the right thing.
