1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,273
I think the decision making is a part of
the issue of assertiveness is always 

2
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,034
thinking about assertiveness,
a home serving as he can be with other 

3
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:13,794
people,
but you have to be assertive with 

4
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:15,984
yourself and make personal decisions.
I know of a woman who takes somebody 

5
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:24,170
else to go shopping with him because she
can't make a decision as to buy the pink

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,150
or the blue.
Right.

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,133
Back in my office,
I used to have a poster that showed a 

8
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:36,750
dog standing between two fire hydrants 
and the caption was decisions,

9
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:37,584
decisions and sometimes the decisions 
that we are indecisive about hour of no 

10
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:48,030
greater consequences than what I 
remember in the Shul.

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,540
There was a whole argument at a meeting 
from the the short organization about an

12
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,424
affair that they were going to have,
whether they shouldn't have the keyhole 

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,840
with sugar or they can't hold without 
sugar.

14
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,730
I mean these,
they said,

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,540
but there are decisions on life that are
much greater than that.

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,633
I mean,
you make the decision as to who you're 

17
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,920
going to marry a decision,
what kind of professional you want,

18
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:12,870
what kind of job you want to.
A.

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,940
As a doctor,
I have to make a decision,

20
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,890
I'm going to treat the patient right 
sometimes their decision,

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,650
um,
do,

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,480
do we take a chance on surgery?
What are the risks of surgery?

23
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,743
So there's all levels of decision making
first and we have to realize is we are 

24
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:32,700
not always going to make the correct 
decision,

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,730
right?
Only God can be right 100 percent of the

26
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:36,564
time I'm going to make wrong decisions,
but my decision making has to be a with 

27
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:45,940
integrity,
right?

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,880
If I go to think about whether I should 
operate on a patient or not,

29
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,700
it's not because how much I can collect 
for the operation,

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,490
but what is the best thing for this 
patient?

31
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,893
So,
uh,

32
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,950
first of all,
we have to realize that we are,

33
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,570
uh,
uh,

34
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,750
housed within a physical body that has 
desires and it has impulses,

35
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,443
etc.
And that they may color our decision 

36
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,280
making,
right?

37
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,420
We may not realize that sometimes we 
were bribed,

38
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,423
right?
And the bribe is because we want things 

39
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:24,360
to turn out a certain way and we don't 
make the decision.

40
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,640
Um,
whAt is really right?

41
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,920
Because we see what is going to be 
right,

42
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,930
what we want to be,
right.

43
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,560
So,
uh,

44
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,440
there was a,
one of the great facility rivers who was

45
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:42,441
asked by one of his followers,
how can I make good decisions?

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
So the rep,
he said,

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,550
did you ever watch the type walker?
He says,

48
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:48,384
the way a tightrope walker keeps his 
balance is that he feels himself pulled 

49
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:55,530
over to the one side,
he overcorrect spot leading to the other

50
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,100
side.

51
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,440
And that's how he keeps his balance.
He says,

52
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,274
when you have a desire to do something,
the first thing you ought to recognize 

53
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,770
is most of the desires come from an 
animalistic traits.

54
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,173
So the first thing you should do is 
think as to why he should not do it 

55
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,653
right?
And then he leaned over to that side 

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,210
venue may make a decision.
Uh,

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,353
I think that we have to have self 
confidence in our decisions and realize 

58
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,743
I am capable of making decisions.
There are times when I have to ask 

59
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,424
expertise that expert advice,
but given that ultimately the decisions 

60
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,614
are mine.
And I also have to realize that not 

61
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,224
making a decision is a decision,
but I've decided not to make a decision 

62
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,800
and I have to realize that if I'm not 
going to make decisions,

63
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,783
people,
other people aren't going to make them 

64
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,680
for me,
right?

65
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,910
And the stations that other people are 
going to make for me,

66
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,810
I much,
much Worse than this.

67
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,420
And then the worst decision that I can 
make for myself because,

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,920
uh,
I have my,

69
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,170
my own interest that night.
Really,

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,080
most people know what's good for them.
So,

71
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,963
uh,
I think that making decisions means 

72
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,170
getting the best possible information,
right?

73
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,513
And having self confidence.
I think it's appropriate to pray for 

74
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,000
decisions,
right?

75
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,930
And that's for divine guidance and help 
me make the right decision.

76
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,470
And then not to be shaken by the fact 
that after we do the best we can,

77
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,720
that the decision may not work out the 
way we want.

78
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,810
Right?
And not to see that a,

79
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,080
a decision that has poor consequences,
not disease.

80
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:32,914
That as a horrible failure on our part.
I always say our decisions are good or 

81
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,170
bad.
Determined by how we made them.

82
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,060
Not what the consequences were.
