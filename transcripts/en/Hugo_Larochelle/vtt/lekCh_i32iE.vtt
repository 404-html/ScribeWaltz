1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.680
In this video,
we'll see how we can perform certain types of inference,
uh,

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.690
in a restricted Boltzmann machine.

3
00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:10.450
And specifically we look at conditional inference.

4
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.460
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.090
<v 1>we've seen the previous video,
the definition of restricted fossil machine.</v>

6
00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:20.640
It's an undirected graphical model with the following,
uh,

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.520
energy function and a,

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.950
we convert that into a probability distribution by just exponentiate the

9
00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:29.560
negative energy and re normalizing.

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.340
So actually computing this joint probability is generally going to be

11
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:39.790
intractable in a respectable some machine because of the normalization constant,

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.500
which requires an,
uh,
an exponential,
some over the numerator.

13
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.880
So that particular inference of the,

14
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.370
this probability is generally going to be intractable.

15
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.570
It will need to be approximated if really want to actually compute that number.

16
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.711
However,

17
00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:01.711
there are other types of inferences that are actually tractable in a restricted

18
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.693
bolsa machine.

19
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.750
And one of the most important is conditional inference of either ex given a

20
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:10.930
value for the age factor or h,

21
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:14.200
the hidden layer given the visible layer value of divisible,

22
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.980
layer x and a.
So what we'll see in the following slides is a,

23
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.830
how to perform that particular inference.

24
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.180
Indeed in the restrictive Bolsa machine,
uh,

25
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.250
the conditional distribution of either h given x or x given h is actually very

26
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:33.650
simple and easy to compute.

27
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.260
So the first fact to know is that the,
uh,

28
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.390
full conditional distribution over the whole vector h the hidden layer given the

29
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.360
visible layer x actually in fact risers.
Uh,
so,
uh,

30
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.060
it turns out that it can be written as the product of each,

31
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.500
a conditional distribution of each individual hidden unit given the full vector

32
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.370
x.
So in other words,

33
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.550
all the hidden layer units here are conditionally independent given the value of

34
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.550
the visible layer x.

35
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.860
<v 1>The other interesting fact is that,
uh,
these distribution here,</v>

37
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:20.450
the individual individual distribution of h j each hidden unit,

38
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:22.520
HJ given x,
uh,

39
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.020
so each day is a binary value random variables.

40
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:29.200
So it's a Bernoulli and it's a Bernoulli,
uh,

41
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.560
which is such that the probability of HD being equal to one also has a very

42
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:34.394
simple form.

43
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.790
It's actually just the sigmoid of the linear transformation of x as multiplied

44
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:46.040
by the JFF row vector of the Matrix of connections.

45
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:50.660
W plus the bias,
uh,
of the Neuron Hg.

46
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.980
So that speeching here.

47
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.720
So here we have the more explicit a formulation where I've just written down

48
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:57.770
with the sigmoid is,

49
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.260
so we see that computing the perimeter of the Bernoulli,

50
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.160
uh,

51
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.850
of each Bernoulli here in this conditional distributions or the probability of

52
00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:11.480
HIV being called to one given x,
uh,
is actually very simple.

53
00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:15.470
It's quite similar actually to a computations we performed frequently in the

54
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.970
feed forward neural network.

55
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.480
It's the linear transformation of the input vector x.

56
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.850
A parent tries by the rows of the matrix w plus the biases of the hidden units.

57
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.640
<v 0>It's okay.</v>

58
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.610
<v 1>Also notice that the restricted was machine is actually a symmetric,
uh,</v>

59
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:36.130
so it's an art director at graphical model.

60
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.930
So are really the form of uh,
the distribution of X.

61
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.950
Given h is not really different from age given x because it's not directed

62
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.843
graphical model.

63
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.390
And so similarly we can then show that each x element of the x factor,

64
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.670
uh,
are conditionally independent given the value of the hidden there.

65
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.090
And similarly,

66
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.240
it's going to be the sigmoid of a linear transformation of my hand and layer h a

67
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:09.240
and now it's going to be parent tries by the columns of a w.

68
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.420
That is to get the probability of x gave equal to one.

69
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.970
We'll just do the sigmoid of Ck,

70
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.500
the bias value for the key input plus,
uh,
the,

71
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.190
uh,

72
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.190
product of the hidden layer with the KF column of a Matrix.

73
00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:27.530
W.
Okay,

74
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.960
so let's not actually derive this result and see how this is true.
So I'll,

75
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:35.380
I'll do the derivation for,
uh,
the condition over h given.

76
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.883
<v 0>Okay.</v>

77
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.660
<v 1>Alright.
So,
um,
first of all,
it's just write p of h given x.</v>

78
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.681
Uh,

79
00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:49.681
so we can write that as the joint over x and h divided by the marginal over

80
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.490
just,
uh,
x.

81
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.080
So that's the summation over all possible hidden layer vector,

82
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.140
which I'm calling h prime here of the joint p of x and h prime.

83
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.410
So this whole some here,
that's just p of

84
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.853
<v 0>x.</v>

85
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.540
<v 1>So next,</v>

86
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.540
let's just actually write the a what p of x and h is a well,

87
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:18.510
that's just the exponential,
the negative energy,
which is that,
uh,

88
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.980
divided by the normalization constant or the partition function and similarity

89
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.903
here.

90
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.470
And also I've just written an explicitly over what we're iterating where we're

91
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:31.910
performing the sun here.
So we're iterating over all,
uh,

92
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.580
vectors that are boundary of size,
capital h,
capital nature's,

93
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:36.780
the number of hidden units.

94
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.160
<v 0>Okay,</v>

95
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.160
<v 1>so we noticed that first we can cancel out the partition function at the</v>

96
00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:44.820
numerator and denominator,

97
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.640
and we can also cancel out this term here and here.

98
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.980
And that's because it does not depend on h two.

99
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.050
It doesn't the print he at the numerator on h prime.

100
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.780
And so we can actually take that out.

101
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:03.830
So we could multiply here by the exponential of see transpose x and remove it

102
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:07.430
from here.
And then it would cancel out with,
what's that?
The numerator.

103
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.440
<v 0>Okay.</v>

104
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.440
<v 1>Next we'll just write down this whole term here into an explicit,</v>

105
00:06:17.741 --> 00:06:22.690
some over,
uh,
all indices in the,
uh,
hidden layer.

106
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.760
So in,
uh,
this,
uh,
well first off,
um,
this,
uh,

107
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:32.790
be transpose times h is that's just a sum over j of Bj Times h j and,

108
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.730
uh,
also this,

109
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.940
we can actually write it down as the sum over the rows of w of x times the roof

110
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:48.490
w times the value of the JFF unit.

111
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.250
So if you don't see this,

112
00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:56.251
I recommend you just sit down and see how this is equivalent to that.

113
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.300
And,
uh,
then I'm just writing exactly the same thing at the denominator.

114
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.050
I've also written an explicitly that this sum here can be written down as a

115
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.320
sequence of sums over the first hidden unit,
uh,

116
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.520
till the last second unit.

117
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:17.500
So a sequence of nested sums over each individual hidden units.

118
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.323
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

119
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.950
<v 1>Then because the exponential of a sum is the product of exponentials.</v>

120
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:27.380
I have that this is equivalent to that.

121
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.120
We have the product of the exponentiate terms that were in today,
some here.

122
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.510
And,
uh,
I have exactly the same thing here.

123
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.793
<v 0>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.950
<v 1>Then I know this,
that in this product,</v>

125
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.470
in the denominator,
uh,

126
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.940
each factor in the product actually depends on a single hidden unit.

127
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.740
H J o h Prime Jane.
It doesn't depend.

128
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.350
This factor here doesn't depend on the other age,
uh,

129
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.470
and other elements of h prime.
Um,

130
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.710
and so what this means is that if I'm summing say over h prime capital h,

131
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.820
all of the terms here in this product are constant with respect to h prime age.

132
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.390
Uh,

133
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:17.370
Kevin will age except for the last one except for age prime age.

134
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.670
So the,
the last term for j Cole's capital h.

135
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.790
So it means that all of the other factors in this product,

136
00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:28.791
I can actually put them in front of the sun and just perform the sum over the

137
00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:30.870
last,
um,

138
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.490
hidden unit of the corresponding factor in this whole product here.

139
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.510
And once I compute this,
well,
then,
uh,

140
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.690
this is a constant with respect to all of their hidden units.

141
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.040
So I can actually put it in front of this whole sun.
And in this way,

142
00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:48.310
I could actually,
uh,

143
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.570
write down this nested some here as just a product of the sum over,

144
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:58.530
um,
the hidden units times the sum over the second hidden it and so on.

145
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.220
So what I've done is that I've converted this,
uh,

146
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:07.310
nested some over a holiday units as just a linear product of the,

147
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:08.420
uh,

148
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.420
as just a product of some over in individual hit an unit for each hidden unit.

149
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.740
So this sum here was a sum of an exponential number of terms.

150
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:25.010
And now here we have actually a product over a capital h number of factors.

151
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.280
And each factor in the product is this here,

152
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:31.080
it's just there's some over an individual

153
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.093
<v 0>it in unit.</v>

154
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.320
<v 1>So now here I'm just writing that as a,
uh,</v>

155
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:45.450
a product with the product sign over j of the sum over the JFF hidden unit.

156
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

157
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.190
<v 1>That's just the definition of,
of that symbol really.</v>

158
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:57.290
Um,
and then I can actually write down what the sum is.

159
00:09:57.291 --> 00:09:59.390
It's only over two terms.
Four h prime,

160
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:02.420
Jake walls zero or h prime j equals one.

161
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.370
So if h prime Jay is equal to zero,
then that's zero,
that's zero.

162
00:10:07.371 --> 00:10:09.680
So the exponential zero is one.

163
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:13.190
And then if h prime Jay is equal to one,

164
00:10:13.191 --> 00:10:16.430
then that will be the exponential of just Bj,

165
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.810
which is here plus this term here,
because this would be one

166
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.460
next,

167
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.840
I can just write this as a single product instead of the fraction of two

168
00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:33.560
products since both products or over,
uh,

169
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.590
the same indices,
uh,
j,
uh,

170
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:41.620
then that's just a product over j of the fraction of the exponential of the,

171
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.790
uh,
factor that involves h j,
uh,

172
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.350
divided by one plus the exponential of Bj plus,
uh,

173
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.360
the g eighth row of w times X.

174
00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.493
Okay.

175
00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:01.680
And I noticed that this is actually a probability.

176
00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:06.100
So if a H J was equal to one,
then I'd get this term.

177
00:11:06.101 --> 00:11:10.370
If HD was equal to zero,
I'd get this term.
So if I see some over this,

178
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.190
if I sum over this expression for each values of,
uh,

179
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.360
that HJ can take,
which probably the age you can take actually sum to one.

180
00:11:19.361 --> 00:11:22.390
So that's actually a,
uh,
distribution.
And so,

181
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.170
and this it turns out is just then the probability,

182
00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:30.080
it must be the probable the of,
uh,
age j,
uh,

183
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.870
taking it's given value,
um,
condition on x.

184
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.680
So now we've shown you finally shown that p of age,

185
00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:43.681
given x or the full conditional over all the elements in age is just a product

186
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.140
of the elements per element,

187
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:51.670
conditional probability of the hidden units in my,
uh,
hidden layer.

188
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.450
Now let's actually show that this is just a sigmoid of a linear transformation

189
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.510
of X.
So,
uh,

190
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:08.830
we had before that,
uh,
this is equal to that.

191
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.370
That's just the last part of our derivation and the previous slide.

192
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:15.780
<v 0>Okay.</v>

193
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.780
<v 1>And now I noticed that if I multiply here by the exponential of minus BJ minus</v>

194
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.890
W.
Dot.

195
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.210
X here and here as well.

196
00:12:30.211 --> 00:12:33.450
So essentially multiplying the whole expression by one,

197
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.960
then this would cancel out with that.
Uh,

198
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.930
this here would cancel out that and then one,

199
00:12:39.931 --> 00:12:43.170
he would be replaced by the exponential of the negative term.

200
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.750
And so that's exactly what we have here.

201
00:12:45.751 --> 00:12:50.130
We have one over one plus the exponential of the negative,

202
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.410
the linear transformation of X.
Okay.

203
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.320
And by definition one over the exponential,
uh,
sorry,

204
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:04.000
one over one plus the exponential of minus something that's the sigmoid.

205
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.710
So that's just really the sigmoid of the lean transformation of x.

206
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.750
So now we've shown that this conditional distribution over a single,
uh,

207
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.850
hidden unit is the sigmoid of the Lennar transformation of x when it's

208
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:22.750
multiplied by the connections between Hj and all elements in x.

209
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.580
And then we add the bias of,
uh,
the JF hidden units.

210
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.333
<v 0>Okay.</v>

211
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.120
<v 1>And,
uh,
just a final remark that,
uh,</v>

212
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.920
really here I've done the full demonstration of this conditional,

213
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:39.930
uh,

214
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:44.970
distribution in an RBM and in particular the a really useful property that we

215
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:49.120
get some conditional independencies between the values of in one layer,

216
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:52.540
given all the values in the other layer.
But in fact,

217
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.940
we could have used a general result note as the or property,
uh,

218
00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:01.660
known as the local mark of property for a mark of network and,
uh,
uh,

219
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.490
for an undirected graphical model,

220
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.910
which simply states that if I haven't conditioned on,
uh,

221
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:12.640
if I have a conditional Savia undirected graphical model and its associated mark

222
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:17.641
of network over a vector of random variable zed one up to zed,

223
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:23.080
uh,
zed v.
And so in here,
I notice here,

224
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.400
uh,
it should be said,
I'm minus one,

225
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.720
said I plus sorry.
Plus one.

226
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:35.200
So here's zed.
Uh,
I should not appear because it's here.

227
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.140
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

228
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.080
<v 1>So the local market property says that this conditional distribution of one run</v>

229
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:45.970
the variable given all the others,
it actually reduces to just the,
uh,

230
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.940
uh,
conditional probability of Zen.

231
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.040
I given only its neighbors.
So in other words,

232
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.830
a p of a zed,
I,
uh,
sorry,

233
00:14:57.831 --> 00:15:02.200
a zed.
I is conditionally independent of all other,
uh,

234
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.580
elements in the,
uh,
uh,

235
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.570
zed variables given its neighbors in the,
uh,

236
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.350
mark of network.
And,
uh,

237
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.040
so then we have that,
this conditional distribution here.

238
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:20.240
It can be written as the,
uh,
joint here.
Sorry.
The,
yes,

239
00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:24.480
the joint over is that I and it's neighbors divided by,
uh,

240
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.640
the marginal over just as neighbors where we've marginalizing overs that I,

241
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.170
and because this is a,
uh,
uh,

242
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.510
undirected graphical model,

243
00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:39.810
which we can write down as a product of factors like this.
Um,

244
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:44.000
then we get the product of all it's factors,
but the factors that involve,

245
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.950
um,
uh,

246
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.950
either only the neighbors or any other ads that I variables in the,
uh,

247
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:56.070
full a vector are actually going to cancel out in the numerator and denominator.

248
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.980
So in the end,
this reduces,
uh,
as just the,

249
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:06.130
uh,
uh,
form,
which is the product of all the factors that involve,
uh,

250
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:06.561
zed,

251
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:11.561
I and any of the neighbors in the neighborhood or is that I in the mark of

252
00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:15.270
network divided by the normalization constant.

253
00:16:15.271 --> 00:16:19.160
So the same thing where we're normalizing by summing over all potential values

254
00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.940
of set and um,
and in fact,

255
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.470
so we could have used that formula,

256
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:29.300
which I've sort of shown just by explaining it.
You can do as an exercise,

257
00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:32.540
try to see how we can get from this to that for general,
uh,

258
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.840
undirected graphical model that we write down as a product of factors.

259
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.530
Um,
but so that's just a general property for uh,
uh,

260
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.190
the uh,
for a mark of network and its associated undirected graphical model.

261
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.900
So we need the mark local mark of property,
just a shows.

262
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.890
So I'll remove some ink.

263
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.190
The local market property really only refers to this and then we can exploit the

264
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:02.780
fact that we have on deck undirected graphical model that separates out as a

265
00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:07.520
product of factors like that.
It's actually gets this slightly simplified form.

266
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.890
And by doing this we could actually have derived a,
the previous result.

267
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.070
So for the restricted Boltzmann machine,

268
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:20.720
they said I variables really correspond to either the ex gay or has or either

269
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:21.630
the,
uh,

270
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.820
visible layer variables are the hidden layer variables and the neighbors would

271
00:17:25.821 --> 00:17:29.610
be the neighbors in the mark of network.
So,
uh,
and this,
uh,

272
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.620
case for a given x gay,

273
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:36.410
this would be all the hidden units age j four j equals one,

274
00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:40.640
two capital h.
And similarly for fixed h j,

275
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:43.880
this would be all the,
uh,
ex,
uh,

276
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.600
ks in the visible layer four k equals one,
two,
uh,

277
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.970
the size of the input layer.
And that's because as we remember,

278
00:17:51.971 --> 00:17:54.310
the mark of Network for an Rbm,
uh,

279
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:59.470
looks something like this where we have connections for a given input to all

280
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:00.931
hidden layers.

281
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:04.410
And similarly for a given hidden there we have connections with all inputs.

282
00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:08.400
In this case,
the neighbor of this guy is the whole visible layer.
Well,

283
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.870
the neighbor of this guy is the whole hidden there.
All Right,

284
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:16.950
so this completes our description of conditional,
uh,
uh,

285
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.100
inference in a restricted Boltzmann machine.
Uh,
it's very efficient and,
uh,

286
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:26.160
it has a simple form and we'll be able to exploit this a further to perform

287
00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:29.890
efficient learning or restricted Boltzmann machine,
which we'll describe,
uh,

288
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.960
the next videos.
