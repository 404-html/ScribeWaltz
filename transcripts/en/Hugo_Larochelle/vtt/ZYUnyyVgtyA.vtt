1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.120
And this video will introduce the notion of a mark off network

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.170
we've seen before that a conditional random fields can be written in a slightly

3
00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:14.530
different for who would we seem perform,
uh,
as a,

4
00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:17.770
essentially a product of some factors.

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.640
And in the case of a linear chain conditional random fields where we have

6
00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:25.540
urinary potentials which correspond to neural networks,

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.690
then these factors would or corresponds to a with crisp onto these terms here,

8
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:32.860
what would we have urinary factors.

9
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:37.861
So the factors that involve this single y and pairwise factors where this factor

10
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.580
involves two adjacent labels,
two wives.

11
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.020
So these would be the urinary factors.
These will be the pairwise factors.

12
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.700
Uh,

13
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.580
a very useful visualization of a given conditional random fields model is known

14
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:56.930
as the mark of network.

15
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.410
So it's a network where the nodes are the random variables in our model and a

16
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:06.740
edges take,
uh,
uh,
our construct and I added into the network,

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.540
uh,
for,
uh,
uh,
based on a very specific reason.

18
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.410
So the way we construct a mark of network for a conditional random fields,

19
00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:20.390
which we've written as a product of factors,

20
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.650
is that first we would write all of the different,
uh,

21
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:29.540
so we have a node for each of the random variable in our models.
In our case,

22
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.920
each of the labels.
If we had the second sequence of uh,
uh,
length five,

23
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:37.700
then we have y one y two y three by five,

24
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.120
as well as a node in this case for each of the input vector x one x two x three

25
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.580
x four and x five.
So now,
uh,

26
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:49.070
then we would add edges for,
uh,

27
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.100
between each random variable that shares a factor in the product of factor form

28
00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:59.690
for our conditional random fields,
for the linear chain,

29
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.400
a conditional random fields.
Then this means that,
uh,
we would have,

30
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:09.190
and also for a context size of a radius,
one context window,

31
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.790
read this one,
then we'd have these diagonal edges between each label,

32
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.180
why?
And it's input at its left.

33
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.750
So then we'd have also an edge between each label and the input at the same

34
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:28.610
position.
So those are the,
uh,
vertical edges here.

35
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.490
And similarly we'd have edges,

36
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.080
a diagonal edges like this between each y and the label too.

37
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:41.250
It's right.
So those correspond to the,
this factor here,

38
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.670
the factor between why K and x,
k plus one.

39
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.640
So those were all of the [inaudible] factors.
And then for the pairwise factors,

40
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:52.100
they would correspond to the original,
uh,

41
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.840
edges here between each why gay and its neighbor white k plus one.

42
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.970
So,
uh,
what's useful,
uh,

43
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.110
with the mark of Network visualization is that,
uh,

44
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:12.550
we can very easily identify sooner unconditional independencies between,

45
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.680
uh,
the random variables of our model.
So,
uh,
for instance,

46
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.640
uh,
he,
the mark of network respects,
uh,

47
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:24.100
what's known as d local mark off property,

48
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.840
meaning that in Denmark of network,
uh,

49
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.910
a random variable is going to be independent of all other random variables that,

50
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.260
uh,
are not,
it's labors given its neighbors.
So for instance,

51
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.330
if I'm considering this random variable,

52
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.130
it's neighbors in this graph would be this one,
this one,
this one,

53
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.650
this one.
And this one,
well,

54
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:52.240
the mark of a local market property tells me that why three is going to be

55
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:57.241
independent of y one x one y five [inaudible] given it's a mark of a blanket.

56
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:07.210
So it's neighbors y two x two x three x four.
And why four?

57
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.340
Okay,
so that can be useful if uh,
we,
uh,

58
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.610
want to determine in our model whether a certain random variables are dependent

59
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:20.140
on each other or independent given other variables that we might observe.
Sophia,

60
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.680
for some reason I was observing sore in the conditional random fields.

61
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.050
All these Upserve x one,
although the inputs,

62
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:28.960
so that's x one x two x three x four and x five.

63
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:33.700
So I've used a double circle dinand fied those notes that are observed when

64
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:38.701
imagined that also happened to observe in the sequence y two and Y for.

65
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.950
So maybe some,
uh,
for some reason I actually have this information,

66
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.430
well the local market property would tell me that d distribution over y three

67
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:55.630
given these five nodes actually does not depend on why one.

68
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.800
So I can just ignore,
ignore it and compute the conditional,

69
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.910
which is only going to depend on these four or these five nodes.

70
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.440
And the particular,

71
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.770
the probably would of course depend on the particular value of y three,
four,

72
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:10.300
which I want to compute the probability.

73
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.123
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.560
<v 0>In fact,
we can say something even a bit more general,
which is,
uh,</v>

75
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.790
if I have two nodes,

76
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.200
well then there are going to be conditionally independent if all the paths

77
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.650
between the two nodes,
uh,

78
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.030
contain at least one of the condition and notes.
So one of the node that,

79
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.550
that I might be observing and I'm conditioning over.
So,
uh,

80
00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:41.980
for instance,
if I'm wondering,
so imagine in the conditional then and uh,

81
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.030
again,
uh,
at,
uh,
when we use it while he's observe all of the input.

82
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.310
Now I imagine that,
uh,

83
00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:53.420
I'm also observing why three and I want to know whether a,
why.

84
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:57.470
One depends on why five in this case,

85
00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:01.220
there's one path between why one and Wifi.

86
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.050
So it's this path.
Actually I could,
there are other paths I could go like this.

87
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.130
And so there's more than one path.
I could go like this and like that.
And so on.

88
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.170
Well,
it turns out in this case,

89
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:17.171
we can easily see that each path between y one and y Phi actually contains one

90
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:23.000
of the note I'm conditioning that is either contains one of the inputs.

91
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.700
So each path that goes through an ex node,

92
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.470
a would be blocked by,
uh,
by,
uh,
the Ex,
uh,

93
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:32.450
note that subserve that I'm conditioning on.

94
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.120
And if I'm assuming I'm also observing this,

95
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.070
well then any node that stays up like this and goes through white three a is

96
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.090
going to contain conditioning notes.
So it's going to be locked in a sense.

97
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.180
And so for that reason,
we could say that y one and y fi the is,

98
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.570
uh,
is independent conditionally independent given x one,

99
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.880
two x five.
And why three?

100
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.530
So that's a useful property of the markup network.
Uh,

101
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.630
it allows us to identify a lot of a conditional and dependencies very easily.

102
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.350
Another thing that's important to understand about conditional random fields is

103
00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:17.820
that they're known as undirected graphical models,
uh,

104
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.560
to be distinguished from a directive graphical models like a hidden mark of

105
00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:26.550
networks and Bayesian networks in general.
Um,

106
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.170
and so what this means is that when I write it in the form of a product of

107
00:07:31.171 --> 00:07:34.170
factors,
well all of the factors,

108
00:07:34.171 --> 00:07:37.420
so I'm giving an example here where we are conditional random fields,

109
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.260
but with uh,
uh,

110
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.300
with no context window or window of size one that only contains the input that

111
00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:47.730
the current position.
So in this case,
I only have,

112
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.830
can think of this as only containing two types of factors.
Uh,

113
00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:55.440
well in this case,
in the,
in the conditional random fields,

114
00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:57.720
these factors only need to be none negative,

115
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.540
so they need to be greater or equal to zero.

116
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.260
That's the only requirement that I have in an undirected graphical model is that

117
00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:10.980
when I write it as a product of,
of,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
factors,

118
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.260
well,
the factors themselves,

119
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.400
they only need to be such that there are always great or an equal then zero.

120
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.360
So that's to be contrasted with a hidden Markov model.
Uh,

121
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.860
so if we visualize it as a Bayesian network,

122
00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:31.360
that is a network where the notes are the random variables and the edges are now

123
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:32.890
directed,
well,

124
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.920
each edge in this case curse ponds to a conditional probability in the model

125
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.040
that's a property of a Bayesian network.

126
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:45.880
And in this case for a hidden Markov Model,
the,
uh,

127
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.940
this arrow here would correspond to a Dick Conditional with illustrate that,

128
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.680
uh,
um,

129
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.170
with corresponding conditional of y two given y one.
And,
uh,

130
00:08:58.171 --> 00:08:59.340
also,
uh,

131
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.570
x to the Arrow from y two two x two would correspond to the conditional

132
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:06.990
probability of x two given y two.
So at the arrows,

133
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:10.410
what are the are saying essentially is that,
uh,

134
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.800
in the generative story behind the model y two was generated based on why one

135
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.730
only and an x two was generated,
uh,
based on,
uh,

136
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:24.120
why two only.
So,
uh,

137
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:29.060
because now if you ride in factor form,
then all the factors,
uh,

138
00:09:29.061 --> 00:09:32.010
will correspond to these probability distributions.

139
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.020
And it means that we do satisfy the fact that these,

140
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.850
because they're probably the distributions,

141
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.970
they're going to be great or an equal than zero.
However,

142
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.830
in a director graphical model,

143
00:09:43.831 --> 00:09:47.460
the factors also need to sum to one retrospect too.

144
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.640
One of the arguments here.
So for instance,

145
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.180
this factor with sum to one with respect to x,
k,
uh,

146
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.970
because it's a conditional property,
it's,

147
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.710
so this distribution over x game and similar lead,

148
00:09:59.711 --> 00:10:04.140
this factor between pairs of labels would something one with respect to why k

149
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:08.460
plus one because it's a conditional distribution over why k plus one.

150
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.140
Okay.
So that's a,

151
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:15.141
an important distinction between a director graphical model like in hmm.

152
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.910
And a conditional random field,
which is an undirected graphical model.

153
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.010
So now the edges do not correspond to conditional distributions.

154
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.660
They just come correspond to factors or uh,
they're associated to fat.

155
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.450
Where with factors are compatible compatibility function.

156
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.130
We just express a preference for the values,
uh,

157
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.730
that can take each of the random variable in the factor of compatibility

158
00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:39.564
function.

159
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.870
And a in particular if we were to try to identify conditional independence is in

160
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:50.340
the director graphical model.
And so from the Bayesian Network,
uh,

161
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.670
it would actually be more complicated.
So there's the,
the separation role,

162
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:57.770
which I want to explain here,
but you can find in most,
uh,
uh,

163
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.390
textbook in the graphical graphical models,

164
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:05.940
which requires a bit more complicated rule than just looking at the past between

165
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:08.840
the variables and identifying whether on the,

166
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.240
each path between the random variables there is a,
at these one node,

167
00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:15.660
which career respond to a conditional note.

168
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:19.790
There's a slightly more complicated rule due to the fact that the,
uh,

169
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.300
edges between the nodes are,

170
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:26.280
are directed and correspond to a normalized factors to conditional

171
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:28.050
distributions.
All right?

172
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:33.051
So that covers mock of networks and as well as the distinction between

173
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.850
undirected and director graphical models.
