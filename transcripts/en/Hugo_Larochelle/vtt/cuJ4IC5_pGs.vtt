1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.160
In this video,
we'll look at the biological inspiration behind a neural networks.

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.370
So we've seen a mathematical definition or what do we mean by a multilayer

3
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:12.960
neural network?
Uh,

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.500
so mathematically we have an input vector,

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.660
which we call the input layer.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.870
And then this vector is transformed into hidden layers where,

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.800
uh,
where each hidden layer is composed of a hidden units,

8
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
which are all a computed by a linear transformation followed by nonlinear

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.470
gravity.
And then so we compose these operations until we reach an output layer,

10
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.830
which makes a particular prediction if we're doing classification and tries to

11
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:45.570
predict the class to which the input the lungs.
So on that we'll look at,

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.290
uh,
what is the biological inspiration behind this model?

13
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:54.030
Why is it that we call these little units here neurons and,

14
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:58.770
uh,
uh,
how did this mathematical formulation,
uh,

15
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:03.170
I was at derived from an inspiration,
uh,
from,
uh,

16
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.490
actual neurons and actual the actual brain.

17
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.870
That's first talk about this idea of structuring a model into several layers of

18
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.250
preprocessing,
of hidden units.
Uh,

19
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.150
one inspiration that we often refer to is,
uh,

20
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.170
from the visual Cortex in the brain.

21
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:27.171
That is the part of the brain that interprets the visuals to Menai that we get

22
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.030
from our retina.
Uh,

23
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.060
so what we know about the visual Cortex is that it is a decomposing two layers

24
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.650
of regions that are connected to each other.

25
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:43.840
So information from the retina is a,

26
00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:47.370
a pass to a first region called Lgn,

27
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.560
and eventually it reaches another region of neurons,
which is called V one.
Now,

28
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.540
uh,
the one,
uh,

29
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.600
is a known to have neurons that are sensitive to particular simple visual forms

30
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:03.900
like edges and corners.
And then this information.

31
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:08.901
So the activity of these neurons is a influences the activity of another region

32
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.100
called [inaudible].
And then eventually it reaches another region called v four,

33
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.070
which now starts,
uh,

34
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.320
extracting some features related to more intermediate visual forms or features.

35
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.690
So essentially groups or combinations of simpler features like edges and

36
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.653
corners.

37
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And then this eventually reaches pit and then ait where we get neurons that are

38
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:39.951
sensitive to particular faces or particular objects in the visual field.

39
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.020
So we see that process,

40
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.700
the processing of information in the visual Cortex goes through these,
uh,

41
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.730
layers or regions that are put in sequence into the processing of the brain.

42
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.750
Now we can look at their cartoon explanation of what we can do with a such a

43
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.490
processing of a or a sequence of regions.

44
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.600
Say we have a first region that might extract different edges in an image,

45
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.483
and then these,

46
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.620
these features would be reused by a subsequent region,

47
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.140
which would then combine these features are,
for instance,

48
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.960
we could have a nose detector that would combine the,
uh,

49
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.480
this feature with this feature.

50
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.980
So this would be this line here and this line here.
Uh,
we could have a mouth,

51
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.390
a neuron which would detect mouse by detecting the presence of this,

52
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.250
this line here and this line here,
which is this line here in this line here.

53
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.490
And then something that would detect,
uh,
two eyes.

54
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.610
So that would be this feature and this feature.

55
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.620
And then again,

56
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.600
the activity of these neurons that can detect noses and mouths and eyes could be

57
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:52.510
combined to get a whole phase detector,

58
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.860
which would be active if they're neuron that detected a mouth,

59
00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.780
a nose,
and two eyes.
Uh,
we're,
uh,

60
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:06.370
we're actually a activated where detecting these,
these particular features.

61
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.780
Okay.
So this is the,
uh,

62
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.460
brain inspiration behind having several layers of,
uh,

63
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.010
processing of hidden layers.

64
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.130
So each of these parts here would correspond to essentially do a layer of

65
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:22.900
neurons in our artificial neural network.

66
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.401
<v 0>No,</v>

68
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:30.450
let's not talk about individual neurons and the way that mathematically we write

69
00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:34.200
them out.
Uh,
where does that come from?
So,
um,

70
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.510
let's talk a little bit about the actual brain.
Now.

71
00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:41.511
We estimate that there are about 10 to the 10 and 10 to the 11 neurons in the

72
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:43.740
human brain.
Um,

73
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.430
Easter on receive information from other neurons through their dendrites.

74
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.270
So then right is kind of like the ears of the,
uh,
the neurons that a,

75
00:04:53.271 --> 00:04:55.560
so he received information from other neurons.

76
00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.350
It is connected to and a,

77
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.360
and then information from that comes from these dendrites is processed within

78
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:09.060
the cell body of the neuron,
which is called the Soma.
Then,
uh,

79
00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:13.230
the neuron will send information through a cable,
a quote,
unquote,

80
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.550
which is called the accent.
And,
uh,

81
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.160
then this accent is going to be connected with other neurons.

82
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.850
Then rights and the point of connection between Iran Saxon,
uh,

83
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.050
it's in the branches out of its accent.
And,
uh,

84
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.650
the other neurons dead rights is going to be called the synopsis.

85
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.030
That's the point of connection where an accident,
uh,
reaches,
uh,

86
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.010
some other neurons,
dendrites.

87
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

88
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.290
<v 0>There's a cartoon illustration of,
uh,
of all of these different terms.</v>

89
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.330
So for a given neuron,
it has some then dried.
So these are these arrows here,

90
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.990
and this is how information is being sent into the cell body or the Soma of the

91
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:56.614
neuron.

92
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.890
Then there's some chemical activity that happens here and the result of this

93
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:03.200
chemical activity,
uh,

94
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.260
this results into an electrical signal that is sent through an accent and

95
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.370
there's an accent is then becomes some branches which are eventually connected

96
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:15.380
to other neurons.
Uh,

97
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.730
a dendrites and the point of connection between these then rights.

98
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.020
So this little square here in this cartoon illustration with this point of

99
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:25.400
connection would be synapsis.

100
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:29.110
So the snaps is where the Axon reaches and other neurons that dragon.

101
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.983
<v 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.070
<v 0>Now,
um,</v>

103
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.650
we'll call an action protection potential and electrical impulse,

104
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:45.070
which travels through,
uh,
the,
uh,
a neuron's Axon.

105
00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.460
So this is actually how our neuron,
we'll communicate with other neurons.

106
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:52.360
This is how it's going to eat to send information.
And a,

107
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:57.361
so essentially this action potential corresponds to a spike in the electrical

108
00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:03.100
voltage electrical potential.
Sorry.
So spikes in voltage in,

109
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.770
uh,
um,
of the accent

110
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.270
and I'm now and action potential that is generated at a neuron is generated.

111
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:13.551
I don't know,

112
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:18.551
I'm sorry if it only if it receives enough of the right pattern of spikes from

113
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.920
other neurons that is connected to.
And so essentially this,
uh,

114
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.410
uh,
level of activity from the other neurons,
uh,

115
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.550
from which a given they're on this receiving information through extend rights.

116
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.730
If it,
if this amount of activity reaches a certain threshold and has the right

117
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.870
pattern,
then our,
uh,
the neuron question,

118
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.510
uh,
will also,
uh,
um,
uh,

119
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.930
generating an action potential will also spike.

120
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

121
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.303
<v 0>Now,
um,</v>

122
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.880
neurons will actually generate several spikes every second.
Uh,

123
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.800
so,
uh,

124
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.480
there's actually going to be a frequency of spikes and that this is called the

125
00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:04.190
firing rate of a neuron.
And this is actually a,
you know,

126
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:09.140
one of the main information or main characterization of the activity of a
neuron.

127
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.880
So we'll often look at its firing rate as a description,

128
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.920
a number that will describe whether a neuron is very active or not.
Actually,

129
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:22.010
neurons always fire a little bit.
And uh,

130
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.040
this sort of a constant level of firing is known as the spontaneous firing rate,

131
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:28.250
uh,

132
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.810
but they will actually fire much more given the right stimulus that is given the

133
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:36.950
right pattern of firing rates in the other neurons it's connected to.

134
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.220
Then our neuron,
we'll,
uh,
might increase.

135
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:43.220
It's a firing rate and my generate many more spikes.

136
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.273
<v 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.960
<v 0>Now,
uh,</v>

138
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:54.961
so essentially the firing rates of some other neurons that are connected to a

139
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.300
given their on,
so we'll call those neurons the input neurons,

140
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.810
they will effectively combined to influence the firing rate of their neurons.

141
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.070
It's connected to,
okay.

142
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:12.960
So if we have one neuron and then it's actually connected to many more neurons,

143
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:17.180
so they have,
uh,
their accent and eventually it reaches the,
uh,

144
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.920
some dendright of this neuron here.

145
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.250
The firing rates or information would be propagated in this way.

146
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.580
So the firing rate of these neurons will influence the firing rate of that

147
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:31.490
neuron that these neurons are connected to.

148
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:38.150
And so depending on the properties of the dendright and the accent,

149
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:44.330
so the dendright of this neuron and the accents of these neurons and neuron can

150
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.020
either work,
um,
so one of these neurons can either,
uh,
make,

151
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.540
uh,
the,
uh,

152
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.900
firing rate of that neuron increase or decrease,

153
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.660
uh,
by increasing its own firing rate.

154
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.230
So if we say that the firing rate of say that neuron a will tend to increase the

155
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:05.880
firing rate of that neuron,

156
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.970
then we'll say that this neuron here excites this neuron here and the otherwise

157
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:17.700
if it decreases it,
then we'll say will inhibit the firing rate of that neuron.

158
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.020
Okay.
So now with all that being said,
uh,

159
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:25.050
what's the relationship with our artificial neurons?

160
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.520
So while they tried to essentially approximate,
uh,

161
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.660
this process of firing rates that are,
uh,
that,
uh,

162
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.180
played together to influence the firing rates of other neurons.

163
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.520
So the activation or the output activation of a given their on.

164
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:43.830
So after the activation function,

165
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.480
we can think of it as sort of a firing rate.
So this is a,
you know,

166
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:50.760
if you have a sigmoid,
this a number between zero and one.

167
00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:55.350
So that's not necessarily a,
the right range for a firing rate.
But if we can,

168
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.220
we can,

169
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.540
we should think of the activation as a sort of the equivalent of the firing rate

170
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:01.374
of that neuron.

171
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.060
Now the weights between the neurons,

172
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:11.190
they actually model whether some given neuron will excite or inhibit other

173
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:14.580
neurons.
So if we have a positive connection between two neurons,

174
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:18.900
it means that the input neuron will excite the,
uh,

175
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.190
output neuron neuron it's connected to.
And uh,
if,
uh,

176
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:27.780
instead it inhibits.
So,
uh,
then we'll have a negative connection.

177
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.870
Okay.
So these weights,
uh,

178
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.440
essentially translate this idea that firing rates can either increase or

179
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:39.441
decrease the firing rates of other neurons and then the activation function and

180
00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:44.160
also the bias within the neuron there sort of a model for this threshold,

181
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:46.350
the behavior of action potentials.

182
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.620
So I said that the firing rates or the firing activities of the neurons that

183
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.680
some given their on this connected to needs to reach a certain level for this

184
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:01.780
neuron to actually spike and a,

185
00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:06.100
so this is what the activation function and the bias,
uh,
sorta tried to model.

186
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.380
So if you have a sigmoidal function,

187
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.520
we'll take this form here and then the bias will determine what's the basic pre

188
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.200
activation of the neurons of the biases negative.
Then,
uh,

189
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.220
so this would be at zero.
If the bisons negative,

190
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.110
then the reactivation would start here.

191
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.320
So this is saying that the pre activation where we combine the activation of the

192
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:34.810
neurons it's connected to.
So there are sort of firing rates,
uh,
this,
uh,

193
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.010
in this particular case,

194
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:41.011
it would mean that it needs to go quite a bit over a zero to reach the maximum

195
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:44.890
firing rate of that neuron.
Okay.
So this is,

196
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.880
we can think of this or the sort of soft threshold and,
uh,

197
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.940
and so this is what the activation function in the biases trying to model this a

198
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.350
soft version of this special,
that behavior.

199
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

200
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.150
<v 0>Okay.
So that's,
uh,
uh,</v>

201
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.440
all we'll say about the biological connection between a artificial neural

202
00:13:03.441 --> 00:13:07.020
networks and real biological neurons.
Um,

203
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.220
often when we do develop neural networks,

204
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.550
we don't always go back and think about,
okay,

205
00:13:13.551 --> 00:13:16.310
let's try to make our neurons more biologically plausible.

206
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.020
Some people use this in their research research,

207
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.390
improve and design better neural networks.
Uh,

208
00:13:23.391 --> 00:13:27.560
but some other will instead focus on the mathematical properties of artificial

209
00:13:27.561 --> 00:13:29.630
neurons and try to play with that.

210
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.090
But it's still a important to know that,
uh,
you know,
there is some,
uh,

211
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.480
they'll fairly weak connection between real artificial,

212
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.520
real neurons and not deficient in neurons.

213
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

214
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.700
<v 0>And,
uh,
actually you want to see some neurons in action.</v>

215
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.020
I suggest you go look at the recording of the Hubble and weaseled experiment

216
00:13:51.021 --> 00:13:55.910
where,
uh,
a neuron in a v one region of a cat,

217
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.640
uh,
visual cortex is being recorded.

218
00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.260
So you can actually hear the neurons spike as a visual stimuli,

219
00:14:03.261 --> 00:14:07.250
which corresponds to some lighting pattern is being changed at,

220
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.580
in the visual field of a cap.

221
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.860
So this is a nice experiment to watch and to get a more tangible feel of,

222
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.030
of what a,
an actual neurons behavior,
uh,
looks like.
It's like.
