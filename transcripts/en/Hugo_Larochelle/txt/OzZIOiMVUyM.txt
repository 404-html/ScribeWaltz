Speaker 1:          00:00          And this video will motivate the design of neural networks that are dedicated for natural language processing problems. So natural process, natural language processing is a, the field that concerns itself with any problem or tasks that involve some sort of language data. Uh, in the, uh, this veto. In the following videos, we'll actually focus on textual data, uh, so data from web pages or written documents that have been converted into a actual words like Ascii characters for instance. Um, speech processing is often considered as part of the types of problems where, uh, that NLP addresses, uh, but it actually has its own dedicated, uh, research community. That's what our conferences, just for speech processing and the natural language processing conferences often mainly concerned themselves and concentrate on a textual processing. And so in the following videos, we'll mainly focus on that text data. So much like for computer vision, uh, we could think about whether we could design neural networks that are specifically designed for solving a text processing problems.

Speaker 1:          01:18          And one particular a specificity of textual data that we'll want to take into account with design neural networks in order to design better neural networks for textual data is the fact that as we'll see, text data is inherently high dimensional. Uh, the words that will be manual relating for performing certain, uh, tasks, uh, we'll see that intrinsically a priority. They are very, very high dimensional objects and manipulating dose, uh, in a naive way in the neural network can lead to some problems. And so there have been solutions for, uh, the, this particular high dimensionality problem for an LP that had been introduced. And, uh, as we see in the following videos, we'll see how to leverage, uh, and directly address the high dimensionality of words. And then it will be problems for many different tasks. So we'll see that in the following videos.
