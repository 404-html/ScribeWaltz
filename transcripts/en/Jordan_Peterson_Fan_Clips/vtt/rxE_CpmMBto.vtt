1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people often say to their kids,</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.430
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter whether you win or </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose,</v>

3
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:10.431
<v Speaker 1>it's how you play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the kid who of course has no idea </v>

4
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:10.431
<v Speaker 1>what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm trying to win.</v>

6
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>And the parents says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it matters how you play.</v>

8
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.850
<v Speaker 1>And the kid pushes them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parents really can't come up with a </v>

9
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>good explanation of why that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might say,</v>

10
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other kids won't play with you if your.</v>

11
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

12
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Because you could say this is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about.</v>

13
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>So there's a game and there's a victory </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the game,</v>

14
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>but then there's the set of all games </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's victory across the set of </v>

15
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>old games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the victory that you attained across</v>

16
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>the set of all games isn't winning all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the games.</v>

17
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>It's being invited to play all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

18
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>And so if you play fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're playing a metagame and the </v>

19
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>metagame is how to win across the set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all games.</v>

20
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And so if you teach your child how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave properly,</v>

21
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:04.011
<v Speaker 1>then they always get invited to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes them winners and that's </v>

22
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:09.441
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you understand that you </v>

23
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:12.081
<v Speaker 1>understand something phenomenally </v>
<v Speaker 1>important about the emergence of </v>

24
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:17.811
<v Speaker 1>because people moral relativists in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular think that morality is </v>

26
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>relative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course human beings are diverse,</v>

28
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:25.461
<v Speaker 1>just like languages are diverse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more than one playable game,</v>

29
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>but there's not really more than one </v>
<v Speaker 1>playable Medicaid.</v>

30
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're either the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that other people want to play </v>

31
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.891
<v Speaker 1>with or you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not the kind of person </v>

32
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>that other people want to play with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're a loser.</v>

33
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>

34
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's true of all cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be playing different </v>

35
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>individual games within their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Undoubtedly they are,</v>

36
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>but the set of all games that they play </v>
<v Speaker 1>is still common across cultures.</v>

37
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what makes us human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say as well,</v>

38
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.440
<v Speaker 1>we're actually evolved to detect people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are good at playing the set of all </v>

39
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.421
<v Speaker 1>possible games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we actually know that that's not </v>

40
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:05.421
<v Speaker 1>theoretical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know,</v>

41
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:09.621
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things are easy to remember and </v>

42
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:09.621
<v Speaker 1>some things are hard to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

43
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>here's something that's easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

44
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>You play with someone in need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheat man,</v>

45
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you will remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like in your mind,</v>

46
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:21.741
<v Speaker 1>that's not going anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're great at detecting </v>

47
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:25.551
<v Speaker 1>cheaters and you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because you can't trust a </v>

48
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:29.451
<v Speaker 1>cheater and you shouldn't invite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheater to play a game with you because </v>

49
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:29.451
<v Speaker 1>they might cheat.</v>

50
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the innate </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality system.</v>

51
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>You remember cheaters because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't good at playing the metagame.</v>

52
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.970
<v Speaker 1>And of course your evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you're adapted to the metagame</v>

53
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>because you're the product of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>immense evolutionary history,</v>

54
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whoever your ancestors were,</v>

55
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.500
<v Speaker 1>which is an unbroken string of </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful reproducers going back three </v>

56
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.380
<v Speaker 1>and a half billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about that.</v>

57
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Every single one of your ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully reproduced it's </v>

58
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>mindboggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chances against that are so.</v>

59
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>It's billions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions to one.</v>

60
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:08.041
<v Speaker 1>And here you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line of three and a half billion </v>

61
00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:11.581
<v Speaker 1>years of success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole world was trying to kill you </v>

62
00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>that whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here you are.</v>

63
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

64
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>you're still only going to last about 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

65
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

66
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

67
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>

68
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.780
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were lots of games that your </v>

69
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>ancestors were playing across that </v>
<v Speaker 1>immense span of time.</v>

70
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

71
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lizard Games and tree dweller games and,</v>

72
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what,</v>

73
00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Crustacean Games,</v>

74
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:40.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that huge set of games and you're </v>

75
00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>adapted to win across those games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

76
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's built into you man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

77
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>that's your central human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes you social.</v>

78
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's not some mere cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct.</v>

79
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

80
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>it's so deeply embedded in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you are.</v>

81
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Alright?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

82
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>well this is a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a game too.</v>

83
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>like that's a monopoly game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>what's the frame?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the rules of the game.</v>

86
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 1>And are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you accept them or it's kind of </v>

87
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

88
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like that happens to be the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hockey has different rules,</v>

89
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 1>basketball has different rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they share is that they have </v>

90
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

91
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>So there's a frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the rules.</v>

92
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And then within the frame there's a goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the goal is whatever the rules </v>

93
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>dictate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:34.771
<v Speaker 1>there's usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually the construction of a </v>

95
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:37.021
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of success within a frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you play.</v>

96
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>So you play monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

97
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>well we'll accept the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the social contract.</v>

98
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll each try to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that'll be fun.</v>

99
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>We find that amusing music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you lose,</v>

100
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 1>what do you say while you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

101
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>there's always another game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's great.</v>

102
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you have that attitude and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>play fair,</v>

103
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't matter that much that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

104
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 1>whether you win or lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you still want to try to win </v>

105
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you're not a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>

106
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.510
<v Speaker 1>but you accept defeat gracefully because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can play again and so and you'll win</v>

107
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 1>some and you lose some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not so bad,</v>

108
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

109
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.190
<v Speaker 1>And even if you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you learn something and,</v>

110
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 1>and you're doing a lot more than one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing while you're playing monopoly,</v>

111
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:21.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're having a conversation and </v>

112
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>learning how to interact with people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning how to regulate your emotions.</v>

113
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>And so even if you lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have any sense,</v>

114
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if your kids have any sense,</v>

115
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>they know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that way you buffer them against </v>

116
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

117
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

118
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I get on next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

119
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should try.</v>

120
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:38.920
<v Speaker 1>But it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

121
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

122
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>that's useful information for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

123
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.120
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

124
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.160
<v Speaker 1>so you're always in one of these little </v>
<v Speaker 1>frameworks and there's just no getting </v>

125
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.160
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

126
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.320
<v Speaker 1>at any given moment this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like field theory.</v>

128
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:58.321
<v Speaker 1>There used to be psychological theories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that talked about the field of human </v>

129
00:05:58.321 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

130
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>And this is kind of what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a field.</v>

131
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>And basically what happens is you parse </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a little part of the world say,</v>

132
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.320
<v Speaker 1>and so you can handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it has some duration.</v>

133
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>You're not aiming at something 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

134
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>It's because how the hell are you going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that?</v>

135
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.700
<v Speaker 1>There's too many variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>so you're aiming at some handleable </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time and you pause it,</v>

137
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 1>a goal in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you plot your route and then that </v>

138
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 1>tells you what's up and tells you what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

139
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] moves you towards the goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and down moves you away from the goal </v>

140
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.971
<v Speaker 1>and that sets up your motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework so that you have some worth </v>

141
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:36.971
<v Speaker 1>attaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

142
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>that's a really interesting thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know too.</v>

143
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why have a goal ball?</v>

144
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.370
<v Speaker 1>It's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no goal,</v>

145
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.520
<v Speaker 1>no positive emotion because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced positive emotion by noticing</v>

146
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:53.921
<v Speaker 1>that you're moving towards a goal and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have to have a goal while </v>

147
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:56.690
<v Speaker 1>you can't have any positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so better have a goal,</v>

148
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>and so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:06:58.431 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>what should the goal be?</v>

150
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could start by saying,</v>

151
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:03.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any goal is better than none,</v>

152
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>and then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

153
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:09.701
<v Speaker 1>it should be a goal that other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>will let you pursue because otherwise </v>

154
00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be kind of difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there'll be even happy to help you</v>

155
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:14.180
<v Speaker 1>pursue it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would even be better.</v>

156
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's a goal that would enable </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to learn how to pursue other goals.</v>

157
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pursue that goal.</v>

158
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would really be good.</v>

159
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 1>And so you can see that your goal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>parameterized,</v>

160
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that any old goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

161
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 1>It means there's some goals that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely and some not so nicely.</v>

162
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 1>There are playable games and non </v>
<v Speaker 1>unplayable games.</v>

163
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you want to have a playable game and</v>

164
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyer,</v>

165
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.670
<v Speaker 1>actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

167
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.120
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're playable games and,</v>

168
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's not obvious which ones better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly obvious which ones </v>

169
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.450
<v Speaker 1>are sustainable and which ones are </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

170
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a set of playable games </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need to extract from that set of</v>

171
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 1>playable games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a game that suits you.</v>

172
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>And that would be partly due to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament,</v>

173
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:06.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because extroverted people want to play </v>

174
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:08.501
<v Speaker 1>an extroverted game and highly neurotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to play a safe game and </v>

175
00:08:08.501 --> 00:08:12.760
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people want to play a generous</v>
<v Speaker 1>game and disagreeable people wanting to </v>

176
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>play a game that's highly competitive so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can win and you know,</v>

177
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.890
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all within the realm of </v>

178
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.340
<v Speaker 1>playable games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means they're socially </v>

179
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.711
<v Speaker 1>acceptable as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that means it isn't just </v>

180
00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:31.660
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't just relative what you decide </v>

181
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's heavily parameterized.</v>

182
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>There's only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a set of playable games and it's</v>

183
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the set is large,</v>

184
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>but it there are commonalities within </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

185
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there are commonalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why morality has a common basis </v>

186
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

187
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.550
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly what we're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to investigate is like what's up?</v>

188
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>

189
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Is there such a thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

190
00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.320
<v Speaker 1>one thing to remember is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't erect a hierarchical structure </v>

191
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.420
<v Speaker 1>with a something to aim at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got no positive motivation because </v>

192
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>you experience positive motivation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to a goal,</v>

193
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:14.031
<v Speaker 1>not from attaining the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that satisfaction and besides it's </v>

194
00:09:14.031 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 1>fleeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well,</v>

195
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you graduate from university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poof,</v>

196
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>next day you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what do you do next?</v>

197
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough problem.</v>

198
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you've solved your </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems by winning that game.</v>

199
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>You just introduced the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having to introduce another game.</v>

200
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's unreliable as a source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>

201
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 1>But what's reliable is you set a goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you try to attain it,</v>

202
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.990
<v Speaker 1>and then that gives your life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally provides your life with </v>

203
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

204
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Speaker 1>That's what meaning is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's more than that,</v>

205
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask yourself,</v>

206
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a really good goal?</v>

207
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're trying to figure out.</v>

208
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.860
<v Speaker 1>What's a really good goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>

209
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got that.</v>

210
00:09:57.271 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm going to walk through at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least partly through.</v>

211
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.690
<v Speaker 1>We'll see how far we get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna Walk Through Pinocchio with </v>

212
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.690
<v Speaker 1>you because that's what the movie's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

213
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say how it came about.</v>

214
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Like it was written the story by a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>named Claudia I,</v>

215
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.360
<v Speaker 1>C o,</v>
<v Speaker 1>l l O v I,</v>

216
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.260
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story,</v>

217
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 1>that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the written one from the Disney version,</v>

218
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 1>the Disney version was a product of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collaboration of geniuses,</v>

219
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:26.580
<v Speaker 1>of animation essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were artistic geniuses,</v>

220
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.730
<v Speaker 1>great at capturing motion and emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that.</v>

221
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Be Stellar at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And imaginative,</v>

222
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:37.590
<v Speaker 1>tremendously imaginative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but collectively imaginative.</v>

223
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 1>And so they put together a collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

224
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

225
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:42.750
<v Speaker 1>how did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>

226
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

227
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 1>they were good storytellers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

228
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means you know,</v>

229
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>the story that works and the story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

230
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And maybe partly what you do is you kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of think out a story and you think,</v>

231
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if this happens?</v>

232
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 1>And maybe this should happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

233
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

234
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.500
<v Speaker 1>that would work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the little flash of </v>

235
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:06.500
<v Speaker 1>inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

236
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:06.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got a piece of the puzzle </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fits you think,</v>

237
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:08.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would work there.</v>

238
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.420
<v Speaker 1>And then you talk to the other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you generate ideas and someone says,</v>

239
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:13.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>

240
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.120
<v Speaker 1>what if they do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone goes now,</v>

241
00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 1>now that's just not believable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to buy that.</v>

242
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.190
<v Speaker 1>And someone else has a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation.</v>

243
00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

244
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes some sense somehow with if they</v>

245
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes,</v>

246
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

247
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.670
<v Speaker 1>that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really,</v>

248
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.260
<v Speaker 1>that really works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

249
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.390
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

250
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

251
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.080
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know why it works,</v>

252
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.330
<v Speaker 1>but it works because it works because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the right story.</v>

253
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.000
<v Speaker 1>And so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

254
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:44.790
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of associated with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>metagame idea.</v>

255
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:50.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a story that you </v>

256
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:50.980
<v Speaker 1>should be acting out that works across </v>
<v Speaker 1>games and you have an inkling of it.</v>

257
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a notion of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a vague apprehension of it.</v>

258
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of built into that archetype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an archetype.</v>

259
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 1>And so then when you read a story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

260
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:04.651
<v Speaker 1>you're just entranced by it and you all </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that you go to a movie and it's a </v>

261
00:12:04.651 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>great movie and it's like you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>blown away.</v>

262
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a movie can pull you in and turn </v>

263
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.341
<v Speaker 1>you into one of the screen characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can run you through a huge set of </v>

264
00:12:14.341 --> 00:12:18.241
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw this movie once about South </v>

265
00:12:18.241 --> 00:12:21.570
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It started with this guy running out of </v>

266
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.041
<v Speaker 1>a subway naked and he didn't know where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was and it turned out that he had </v>

267
00:12:23.041 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 1>been absconded by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

268
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.340
<v Speaker 1>the totalitarian death squads and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't remember anything about </v>

269
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went back to his village.</v>

270
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:35.131
<v Speaker 1>And basically what happened was that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up back in the totalitarian death </v>

271
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 1>grip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

272
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:43.750
<v Speaker 1>it showed how the fascist state had </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated the village completely,</v>

273
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.790
<v Speaker 1>and so it was a tragedy and you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>see with every action that this guy,</v>

274
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:54.330
<v Speaker 1>this amnestic guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he recreated him himself and </v>

275
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.931
<v Speaker 1>remembered his identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to travel down exactly the </v>

276
00:12:57.931 --> 00:13:00.901
<v Speaker 1>same road because nothing had changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the time I wish I've looked for </v>

277
00:13:00.901 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>what that movie was for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been able to find it again.</v>

278
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.880
<v Speaker 1>But when the movie was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single person in the theater was </v>

279
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 1>crying and not just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like they were just out of it.</v>

280
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.680
<v Speaker 1>It was brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying movie.</v>
