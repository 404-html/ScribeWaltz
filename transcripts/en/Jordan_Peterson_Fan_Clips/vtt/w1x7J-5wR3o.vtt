00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I was having a discussion with Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris the other day,</v>

2
00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:06.390
<v Speaker 1>which was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said we got wrapped around an axle,</v>

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:15.651
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris is one of the four famous </v>

5
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:19.820
<v Speaker 1>atheists along with Christopher Hitchens</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennett.</v>

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we were having a discussion and </v>

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a determinist just right down to </v>

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're determined,</v>

9
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>you're determined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no freewill.</v>

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>You're a deterministic machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

11
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>if you're a coherent scientist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a Newtonian,</v>

12
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.190
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have much choice other </v>

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.711
<v Speaker 1>than to think that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't how it seems to people </v>

14
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>and we don't treat each other that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our entire legal system is </v>

15
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that you do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact have freewill.</v>

16
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>can we account for it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:56.061
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do we have a scientific model for </v>

19
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:56.061
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

20
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I would also say we do not have</v>

21
00:00:56.461 --> 00:01:01.461
<v Speaker 1>a scientific model for consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know a damn thing about </v>

22
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why Dan Dennett book,</v>

23
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>which was called consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained,</v>

24
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>was referred to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's by it's critics as consciousness </v>

25
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.251
<v Speaker 1>explained a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly right as far as I'm </v>

26
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:16.581
<v Speaker 1>concerned because he took a mechanistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach and I just don't think you get </v>

27
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>to do that because there's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>really weird about consciousness.</v>

28
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>th,</v>

29
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists Heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who tried to radically transform western</v>

30
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>philosophy right from the bottom up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he basically said,</v>

31
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>you can treat the world as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is primary and that human </v>

33
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>experience is reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's reality and that he doesn't exist</v>

34
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>independently of consciousness in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicable way.</v>

35
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>what's out there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's nothing to to experience it?</v>

37
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything at once.</v>

38
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

39
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really comprehensible as </v>

40
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>without a subject that subject defines </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

41
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>It makes it real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't have to believe that,</v>

42
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:59.391
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least I'm telling you that there </v>

43
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:02.241
<v Speaker 1>are thoroughly coherent philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions that make that case very </v>

44
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:07.971
<v Speaker 1>strongly and that that allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness to exist as a phenomena </v>

45
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:12.561
<v Speaker 1>and to take it seriously and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly act like you take it </v>

46
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:15.861
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Act like there's a you and that you </v>

47
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>make choices and you certainly treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people that way.</v>

48
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Deterministic or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still going to get angry when </v>

49
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.621
<v Speaker 1>they're being rude to you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to act as if they had some choice </v>

50
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>in the matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe that's an illusion possibly,</v>

51
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.400
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the oldest stories that </v>

52
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>we have always include that as not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a fundamental element,</v>

53
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:37.860
<v Speaker 1>but even as the fundamental element so.</v>

54
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can think about that however you </v>

55
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.030
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

56
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>so Japan comes along and he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>finish off the puppet.</v>

57
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>And so what does he do to finish off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet?</v>

58
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>He gives it a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

59
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>it gives it a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives it a mouth.</v>

60
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really,</v>

61
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Genesis,</v>

62
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>in Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

63
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.450
<v Speaker 1>this is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex idea and it took people </v>

64
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.241
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years to figure this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and it's something like this is so </v>

65
00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was chaos and that was like </v>

66
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something like potential,</v>

67
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>the potential for being and God who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>God?</v>

68
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>The father in the genesis account uses a</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty that he has,</v>

69
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.320
<v Speaker 1>which is the word to call being from </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos knots,</v>

70
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>the creation of Ba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:34.141
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the manifestation of order from </v>

72
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>chaos and it's the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logos that it's.</v>

73
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>It's the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the tool that God uses to do that</v>

74
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>and that logos in Christianity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with Christ,</v>

75
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:48.331
<v Speaker 1>which is a very weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason for that is that there's </v>

76
00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:51.750
<v Speaker 1>an idea that the divine element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual is the thing that uses </v>

77
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicative language to call the world</v>

78
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:02.851
<v Speaker 1>into being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is what we do as far as we can </v>

79
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:02.851
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you make a decision.</v>

80
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>You think it through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk it over with your friends,</v>

81
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>you plot a course and the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself in relationship to your</v>

82
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:14.371
<v Speaker 1>choice and it's for that reason and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is for that reason that in genesis and </v>

83
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:18.691
<v Speaker 1>in many other accounts that that logo's </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity is identified with human </v>

84
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:23.761
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have a small bit of that </v>

85
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:23.761
<v Speaker 1>in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that means,</v>

86
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 1>and you participate in the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually generating order out of </v>

87
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>chaos and and sometimes the reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mediate between them and so and that</v>

88
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.480
<v Speaker 1>is that in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

89
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

90
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>in Western culture and certainly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case at other cultures as well,</v>

91
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>that that's why you have rights.</v>

92
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the law has to respect you is</v>

93
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 1>because you've got this spark of </v>
<v Speaker 1>divinity in you that's transcendent that</v>

94
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>nobody gets to transgress against and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

95
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe that?</v>

96
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

97
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>you act like you believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You treat other people like you believe </v>

98
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.081
<v Speaker 1>it or they're not very happy with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it depends on what you mean by </v>

99
00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>believe you acted out well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you accept it as a proposition?</v>

100
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you accept that as a </v>

101
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

102
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>because I think the best indicator of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you believe is how you act.</v>

103
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Not what you say because what do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about what you know?</v>

104
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Hardly anything and so actions speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>louder than words and if you want to be </v>

105
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:28.651
<v Speaker 1>treated properly by someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that you want to </v>

106
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 1>treat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want them to treat you as a valuable</v>

107
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>autonomous entity.</v>

108
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you're not that.</v>

109
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:40.081
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're a deterministic puppet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what this strange movie suggests is that</v>

110
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>you are kind of a deterministic puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you don't have to be all right,</v>

111
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>well you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mouth goes on and then Japan was </v>

112
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>happy about that and then they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little dance,</v>

113
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

114
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>they turn the music on and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>little music boxes and they all play </v>

115
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>together and it's like harmony of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort has been established because that's</v>

116
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:04.781
<v Speaker 1>what the music represents and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's layers of reality that are </v>

117
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>communicating with one another because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the music represents.</v>

118
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>And then they have a little dance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that,</v>

119
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing to let this puppet </v>

120
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 1>habits own voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

121
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting idea because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell does it?</v>

122
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a wooden headed marionette.</v>

123
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Why the hell would you want something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that to talk?</v>

124
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same question you have in </v>

125
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.980
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what do they know?</v>

126
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 1>They're two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.310
<v Speaker 1>they don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

128
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>so should you just like tyrannized them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make them do everything you want?</v>

129
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to let them have a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a voice?</v>

130
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on whether do we want them to</v>

131
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:44.621
<v Speaker 1>be a puppet or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't want them to be a </v>

132
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 1>puppet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want them to grow up autonomous,</v>

133
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>then you let them have a voice and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate the development of that voice</v>

134
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>and so and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

135
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you do if you don't want</v>

136
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 1>a marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

137
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>and Japan who doesn't want a marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he gives the puppet of voice even </v>

138
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>though he knows it's just a puppet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

139
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't know anything.</v>

140
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 1>And then this is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cricket sitting up there watching</v>

141
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.650
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty happy with it.</v>

142
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:14.651
<v Speaker 1>That's the first little seed and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and he's sitting by this other </v>

143
00:07:14.651 --> 00:07:17.651
<v Speaker 1>thing that is just not happy at all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the terrible father and you </v>

144
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:21.020
<v Speaker 1>see it's a character that repeats </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the entire movie.</v>

145
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:26.021
<v Speaker 1>You see manifestations of the tyrannical</v>
<v Speaker 1>father continually through the movie in </v>

146
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 1>different characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's played out by different roles.</v>

147
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>And so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cricket is so thrilled about this.</v>

148
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>And then he looks at the frowning king </v>
<v Speaker 1>there who's,</v>

149
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>who is not happy that the puppet has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been given a voice.</v>

150
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 1>He's a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

151
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:44.381
<v Speaker 1>He's the representation of a tyrant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a tyrant does not want you to have a </v>

152
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:47.561
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the cricket looks at him and </v>

153
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:47.561
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

154
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:47.561
<v Speaker 1>you can't please everybody all the time.</v>

155
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's just this tiny little fragment </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a joke,</v>

156
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

157
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.000
<v Speaker 1>there's this old idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it comes from Chekhov and,</v>

158
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>and the idea is that if you set a </v>
<v Speaker 1>playoff and there's a gun,</v>

159
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 1>a rifle or a pistol on a table in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first act,</v>

160
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 1>it better have been used by the third </v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

161
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:09.191
<v Speaker 1>Or it shouldn't have been there at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea is you don't put anything </v>

162
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>in your play that it's random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never do that.</v>

163
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this isn't life,</v>

164
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this isn't life.</v>

165
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.480
<v Speaker 1>This is a work of art and everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected and it's caught know it's </v>

166
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.110
<v Speaker 1>there by intent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this isn't accidental that this </v>

167
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 1>little king character doesn't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on or that he shows up.</v>

168
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.320
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

169
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 1>all the clocks go off and the music </v>
<v Speaker 1>boxes go and they have a little dance </v>

170
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's happy about it.</v>

171
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Japan notices what time it is.</v>

172
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:45.671
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a tremendous emphasis on </v>
<v Speaker 1>time in this part of the movie because </v>

173
00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 1>there are all these clocks are going off</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're all telling him what time it</v>

174
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:52.541
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 30 clocks go off and then he takes </v>

175
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 1>his watch out and notices what time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

176
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:57.731
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about going on is like whack </v>

177
00:08:57.731 --> 00:08:59.160
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 1>dozens of times so that you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a little joke that he pulls out</v>

179
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 1>his watch and he figures out it's time </v>
<v Speaker 1>for bed.</v>

180
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we're making a transition between</v>

181
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:11.280
<v Speaker 1>the conscious world and the unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

182
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

183
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:17.721
<v Speaker 1>so there's an intimation in the movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everything that happens now is in </v>

184
00:09:17.721 --> 00:09:20.410
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way you know that is that it's,</v>

185
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>it's strange because the movie moves in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and out of this underworld.</v>

186
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>But at the very end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Pinocchio's transformed into a real</v>

187
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:33.321
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last thing Japan does is I think </v>

188
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:36.141
<v Speaker 1>it's Japan always hit one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pendulums and start all the clocks </v>

189
00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it says,</v>

190
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:41.280
<v Speaker 1>if what happens from here onwards is </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a dream,</v>

191
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.760
<v Speaker 1>now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's murky because Pinocchio goes to </v>

192
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.970
<v Speaker 1>school and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the next day and all of that.</v>

193
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:52.971
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are sort of realistic </v>

194
00:09:52.971 --> 00:09:55.131
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also the whole going </v>

195
00:09:55.131 --> 00:09:55.131
<v Speaker 1>down into the ocean to find the whale </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

196
00:09:55.131 --> 00:09:58.971
<v Speaker 1>which seems completely dreamlike and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an intimation that we're in </v>

197
00:09:58.971 --> 00:09:59.680
<v Speaker 1>a different kind of world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

198
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.190
<v Speaker 1>and so we go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all go to sleep,</v>

199
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.920
<v Speaker 1>including the cricket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then Japan,</v>

200
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notices the star and because he's a good</v>

201
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:13.941
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes a wish on the start and we've </v>

202
00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:14.280
<v Speaker 1>already explained why you might wish on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a star and what that might mean.</v>

203
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 1>And He makes it very interesting wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

204
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a self serving wish.</v>

205
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite the contrary.</v>

206
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.980
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't wish that Pinocchio is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>obedient son.</v>

207
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't wish that he's produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who will work for him.</v>

208
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't wish any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wishes what a good father would wish,</v>

209
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.570
<v Speaker 1>which is that the creation that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought forth would develop its capacity</v>

210
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 1>for autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants them to become real.</v>

211
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:46.911
<v Speaker 1>He wants him to become an actual living </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature and not a wooden headed </v>

212
00:10:46.911 --> 00:10:48.420
<v Speaker 1>marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd say,</v>

213
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what your father should wish for</v>

214
00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:51.560
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

215
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.200
<v Speaker 1>and I have clients frequently whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>fathers weren't like that at all.</v>

216
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:57.450
<v Speaker 1>They were to radical or they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>neglectful or,</v>

217
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 1>or they punish this person every time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did something good.</v>

218
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:07.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a real fun game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They competed with them and undermining </v>

219
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:12.831
<v Speaker 1>them at every opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to produce someone </v>

220
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:12.831
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And autonomous,</v>

221
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:17.090
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to give birth to a slave and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then diminish it as much as possible.</v>

222
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:24.110
<v Speaker 1>And so that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good and not so Japan was not </v>

223
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.110
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he says,</v>

224
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.911
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wish for something </v>

225
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:29.280
<v Speaker 1>completely unreasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that part of that ideal idea,</v>

226
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:34.281
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're unreasonable thing is that </v>

227
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 1>this puppet could become</v>

228
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.270
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could actually take on its autonomy and,</v>

229
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.150
<v Speaker 1>and move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what he wishes.</v>

230
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.330
<v Speaker 1>And then they go to sleep</v>

231
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.220
<v Speaker 1>and then the cricket starts to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven mad by the noises of the clock.</v>

232
00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>And so it's like he's going into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

233
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>of hyper alertness and the clocks are </v>
<v Speaker 1>clanging.</v>

234
00:11:56.651 --> 00:12:01.651
<v Speaker 1>Adam and Jupiter was snoring and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he can even hear the little </v>

235
00:12:01.651 --> 00:12:04.860
<v Speaker 1>grains of sand falling out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the our glass.</v>

236
00:12:04.861 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 1>He's becoming hyper alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper alert,</v>

237
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>and then he yelled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

238
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 1>And all the clock stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is pretty good trick for cricket,</v>

239
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's the master of time.</v>

240
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 1>But also we're in a place now where time</v>
<v Speaker 1>has come to a stop or outside of time.</v>

241
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that Freud pointed</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

242
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 1>dreams is that dreams are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of time.</v>

243
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what that means is first of all,</v>

244
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 1>they draw and eternal themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>

245
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:32.680
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must have had this experience.</v>

246
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:37.680
<v Speaker 1>And Freud noted this carefully in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of dreams where you know </v>

247
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.250
<v Speaker 1>you're sleeping and the alarm goes off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the alarm noise is incorporated into</v>

248
00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:46.501
<v Speaker 1>your dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the dream has been going </v>

249
00:12:46.501 --> 00:12:49.501
<v Speaker 1>on for an hour in subjective time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you wake up and you realize that </v>

250
00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:49.501
<v Speaker 1>it's the alarm clock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>

251
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:54.550
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason why your dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>time should be the same as real time </v>

252
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 1>because it's all going on in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

253
00:12:55.481 --> 00:13:00.481
<v Speaker 1>But it's amazing in some sense how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>can happen in such a short period of </v>

254
00:13:00.481 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 1>time in your imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's outside of time.</v>

255
00:13:03.881 --> 00:13:07.030
<v Speaker 1>The world of fantasy is in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of outside of time.</v>

256
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:10.960
<v Speaker 1>And so the cricket tells time to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it does.</v>

257
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And then the star enlarges and it turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this blue fairy who's got a </v>

258
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 1>celestial gown covered with stars.</v>

259
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.140
<v Speaker 1>And who's got wings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she's kind of some ethereal being and</v>

260
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.230
<v Speaker 1>like you don't have a problem with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movie.</v>

261
00:13:32.231 --> 00:13:32.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

262
00:13:32.861 --> 00:13:33.490
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

263
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:35.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a ferry.</v>

264
00:13:35.371 --> 00:13:37.180
<v Speaker 1>It came from a star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes perfect sense,</v>

265
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>which of course it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense whatsoever.</v>

266
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense,</v>

267
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:46.090
<v Speaker 1>but you're willing to go along with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because on the one hand it makes sense.</v>

268
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:51.150
<v Speaker 1>No sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand it makes perfect </v>

269
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.150
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the fairy godmother idea.</v>

270
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

271
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairy God,</v>

272
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:52.050
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

273
00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:53.050
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got that.</v>

274
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's in the idea there is that while</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature comes to your aid,</v>

275
00:13:57.701 --> 00:13:58.870
<v Speaker 1>it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

276
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the benevolent force of nature is </v>

277
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.661
<v Speaker 1>on your side now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not obviously only on your side because </v>

278
00:14:06.661 --> 00:14:10.030
<v Speaker 1>it opposes you as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's your own mother as well</v>

279
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:12.250
<v Speaker 1>who's also nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's on your site.</v>

280
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an idea here and the idea is</v>

281
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:20.581
<v Speaker 1>that if the father gets the wish right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aim right for the child,</v>

282
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 1>then nature will cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

283
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's true.</v>

284
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:31.531
<v Speaker 1>Is that if you set up your relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cultural relationship with your </v>

285
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:33.700
<v Speaker 1>child properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're far more likely to flourish</v>

286
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and so you get the magic of nature on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your side by establishing the proper </v>

287
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 1>aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what happens.</v>

288
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh says,</v>

289
00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:42.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm.</v>

290
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.100
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm aiming at and because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's aiming at at it and because it's </v>

291
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:52.111
<v Speaker 1>within the realm of possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature comes to his service and that is </v>

292
00:14:52.111 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 1>how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly how it works because when</v>

293
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:59.861
<v Speaker 1>you aim at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you muster your biological forces </v>

294
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:05.081
<v Speaker 1>towards that goal and if the goal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>feasible and attainable,</v>

295
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:09.200
<v Speaker 1>then you will cooperate with yourself.</v>

296
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 1>And so that's quite cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Rogers would call that.</v>

297
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>What's the word for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he called a genuineness,</v>

298
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:19.920
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

299
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.980
<v Speaker 1>But I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's still what he called it.</v>

300
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 1>He sort of meant that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

301
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:27.881
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of what happens when your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your goals and your physiological </v>

302
00:15:27.881 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>and biological being are aligned well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're and you can communicate both.</v>

303
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:37.061
<v Speaker 1>You're not full of internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions and so your conscious </v>

304
00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:41.110
<v Speaker 1>aims and your biological possibilities </v>
<v Speaker 1>are manifesting themselves in the same </v>

305
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so while that would be good,</v>

306
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.120
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fairy shows up and she's quite </v>

307
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.120
<v Speaker 1>sexually attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's quite provocative and she,</v>

308
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.050
<v Speaker 1>she charms the cricket and who gets all </v>
<v Speaker 1>blushes and like is all,</v>

309
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed and overwhelmed by this like</v>

310
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 1>figure of celestial beauty and decides </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cooperate.</v>

311
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:06.110
<v Speaker 1>That conscience decides to cooperate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some responsibility.</v>

312
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:11.110
<v Speaker 1>And so the ferry allows the puppet to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move without strings.</v>

313
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the intervention of nature.</v>

314
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Culture focuses the aim and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the intervention of nature that produces</v>

315
00:16:20.331 --> 00:16:23.040
<v Speaker 1>the autonomy and that seems to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

316
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.620
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandable,</v>

317
00:16:24.621 --> 00:16:29.621
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so she takes the strings off </v>

318
00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

319
00:16:31.551 --> 00:16:36.551
<v Speaker 1>that's partly because your child is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not just a creature of </v>

320
00:16:36.551 --> 00:16:40.481
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By no means your child has a </v>

321
00:16:40.481 --> 00:16:42.221
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see that right away and that </v>

322
00:16:42.221 --> 00:16:44.711
<v Speaker 1>temperament will unfold and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll unfold in a cultural context </v>

323
00:16:44.711 --> 00:16:49.151
<v Speaker 1>that's amenable to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the combination of those two </v>

324
00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:51.821
<v Speaker 1>things will produce something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can talk,</v>

325
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:59.350
<v Speaker 1>he can walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the good fairy basically tells </v>

326
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.921
<v Speaker 1>him that he's got a bit of autonomy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's up to him to like clue in Tibet</v>

327
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:08.350
<v Speaker 1>and act properly and learn the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between good and evil and to </v>

328
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 1>speak truthfully and all that.</v>

329
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit a propagandistic that part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie I would say,</v>

330
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.080
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of inculcation of conventional</v>

331
00:17:15.081 --> 00:17:20.081
<v Speaker 1>morality and there's a fair bit to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially that he's supposed to tell </v>

332
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:20.720
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

333
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says he will.</v>

334
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.480
<v Speaker 1>And the crickets listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the puppet asks,</v>

335
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:27.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does conscience mean?</v>

336
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Because the ferry says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always let your conscience be your </v>

337
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.070
<v Speaker 1>guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

338
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does consciousness mean?</v>

339
00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:38.921
<v Speaker 1>And then the bug who's like all puffed </v>
<v Speaker 1>up because he wants to impress the </v>

340
00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:42.071
<v Speaker 1>ferry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plops down and gets on his little </v>

341
00:17:42.071 --> 00:17:44.291
<v Speaker 1>matchbox and gives this like horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>little lecture about how to behave </v>

342
00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:46.430
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just like ideological chatter.</v>

343
00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:48.110
<v Speaker 1>You could hardly even stand listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

344
00:17:48.111 --> 00:17:53.111
<v Speaker 1>And it's supposed to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's generic moral advice that anyone </v>

345
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:58.431
<v Speaker 1>could give that's kind of dull and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also puffed up and grandiose and </v>

346
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.240
<v Speaker 1>he's just not very good at it.</v>

347
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why he's on his little </v>

348
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:05.900
<v Speaker 1>matchbox there with his chest puffed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

349
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 1>And so he says that's just the travel </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the world today.</v>

350
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.200
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's his opening line,</v>

351
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:15.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's diagnosing the whole world and you </v>

352
00:18:15.201 --> 00:18:15.201
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fairy,</v>

353
00:18:15.201 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 1>she thinks he's kind of funny because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and you know,</v>

354
00:18:17.581 --> 00:18:22.581
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real interesting thing here </v>

355
00:18:22.581 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 1>going on because he's male and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's all puffed up with his knowledge,</v>

356
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:28.821
<v Speaker 1>which is completely shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's put in contact with this </v>

357
00:18:28.821 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 1>celestial feminine ideal and he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into a complete moron.</v>

358
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:34.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happens to man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens to them all the time.</v>

359
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:40.220
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she decides to give them a chance and </v>

360
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.590
<v Speaker 1>turns them into this conscience and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden he's this like 19 twenties </v>

361
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.590
<v Speaker 1>millionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He's been,</v>

362
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 1>he's been ennobled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then she tells him that,</v>

363
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:51.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to journey along with Pinocchio </v>

364
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.830
<v Speaker 1>in order for things to go properly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he promises that he'll be a good </v>

365
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.881
<v Speaker 1>conscience and do it and he already </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks that he can do it and that's why </v>

366
00:18:58.881 --> 00:19:00.370
<v Speaker 1>he's on the matchbox podium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

367
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.460
<v Speaker 1>espousing his morality.</v>

368
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.280
<v Speaker 1>But the reality turns out to be much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex.</v>

369
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:11.270
<v Speaker 1>So the bug has a little talk with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket or the bug has a little talk </v>

370
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:17.691
<v Speaker 1>with the puppet and the Bug tries to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell Pinocchio explicitly what it means </v>

371
00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:23.001
<v Speaker 1>to be good and he gets completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangled up in the explanation because </v>

372
00:19:23.001 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 1>what the hell does he know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

373
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.120
<v Speaker 1>the Papa doesn't understand anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he says anyways.</v>

374
00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:32.121
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a message there and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>message is the kind of knowledge that </v>

375
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:37.221
<v Speaker 1>the conscience is that the conscience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the puppet are supposed to cocreate </v>

376
00:19:37.221 --> 00:19:40.350
<v Speaker 1>is not something that you can articulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily as a table of rules.</v>

377
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that because life is too </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated to just have fought five </v>

378
00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.180
<v Speaker 1>rules that you live by and that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve every problem.</v>

379
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Partly because the rules will conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge part of the problem,</v>

380
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:52.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

381
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.760
<v Speaker 1>One moral guideline contradicts another </v>
<v Speaker 1>ines situations like you don't know what</v>

382
00:19:56.761 --> 00:19:58.680
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

383
00:19:58.681 --> 00:20:02.670
<v Speaker 1>they decided that there they decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're just going to.</v>

384
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.740
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio says,</v>

385
00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:07.050
<v Speaker 1>well I'll be a good boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the cricket says,</v>

386
00:20:07.051 --> 00:20:08.490
<v Speaker 1>well that's the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

387
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.620
<v Speaker 1>well then Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

388
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:15.650
<v Speaker 1>gets wind of it and they have a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>like horror episode and then he finds </v>

389
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:20.460
<v Speaker 1>out that the public can is autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a little party which tells</v>

390
00:20:20.461 --> 00:20:25.461
<v Speaker 1>you exactly what your pedals up to is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The autonomy emerges and he's happy </v>

391
00:20:25.461 --> 00:20:30.051
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's stamping home the notion that </v>

392
00:20:30.051 --> 00:20:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Japan is in fact a good guy and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is in fact what he wants.</v>

393
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:37.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the encouragement of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father is a precondition for the </v>

394
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:41.511
<v Speaker 1>emergence of your individuality and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also allows the feminine to play </v>

395
00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:46.851
<v Speaker 1>a role both as nature and perhaps as </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and so and the combination of </v>

396
00:20:46.851 --> 00:20:49.090
<v Speaker 1>those two produces the autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

397
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

398
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>that seems perfectly reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So off they go to sleep,</v>

399
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.070
<v Speaker 1>next day they wake up and it's a new day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

400
00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:02.310
<v Speaker 1>and Pinocchio is off to school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing too because Japan </v>

401
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:06.900
<v Speaker 1>isn't and he's really excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that he's been</v>

402
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.840
<v Speaker 1>parented properly and he's going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out into the world of his peers,</v>

403
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 1>which is where he belongs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Japan isn't too worried about it.</v>

404
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:16.030
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is pushing them out the door,</v>

405
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:17.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like go,</v>

406
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.840
<v Speaker 1>you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the next thing.</v>

407
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.990
<v Speaker 1>The kid isn't cowering in the corner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome by terror with the parents </v>

408
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:26.440
<v Speaker 1>freaking out about all the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to go wrong.</v>

409
00:21:26.441 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some faith in his,</v>

410
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:33.750
<v Speaker 1>his ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he sees all the kids wandering by </v>

411
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Japan,</v>

412
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:38.950
<v Speaker 1>no dresses them up and sends them off to</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and so and so.</v>

413
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a happy family story.</v>

414
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:44.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like mom and dad got together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decided that there,</v>

415
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.320
<v Speaker 1>the kid was gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

416
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 1>be competent and autonomous and ready to</v>
<v Speaker 1>face the world.</v>

417
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:55.021
<v Speaker 1>And so Audi goals and so he's like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old at this point or something </v>

418
00:21:55.021 --> 00:21:58.981
<v Speaker 1>like that and that's where we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're at in the story and I</v>

419
00:21:59.441 --> 00:22:04.441
<v Speaker 1>think that's a good place to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the next thing that happens is </v>

420
00:22:04.441 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 1>normally essentially it's like Pinocchio</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes off to be a good boy,</v>

421
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that that's a hell of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot more complicated than he might think</v>

422
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:15.970
<v Speaker 1>because there are actually complications</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>

423
00:22:15.971 --> 00:22:20.560
<v Speaker 1>but also malevolence right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The desire for things not to go right.</v>

424
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:25.561
<v Speaker 1>There are people who are not oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the ideal in any way.</v>

425
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Adult and Pinocchio's young and naive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he has no defense whatsoever </v>

426
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:35.590
<v Speaker 1>against this malevolence and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

427
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.270
<v Speaker 1>that's not an expect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unexpected.</v>

428
00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And it also turns out that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>

429
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.540
<v Speaker 1>the cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is still not very clued in over </v>

430
00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.500
<v Speaker 1>sleeps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's just not there at a critical</v>

431
00:22:50.501 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think we'll pick that up.</v>

432
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:57.400
<v Speaker 1>We'll pick that up next week because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a good point in the plot to stop</v>

433
00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.630
<v Speaker 1>the child has entered the broader world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and has to cope with it.</v>

434
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:07.260
<v Speaker 1>And so he's prepared because he had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful father and he had a magical </v>

435
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>mother and so he's as prepared as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be.</v>

436
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.560
<v Speaker 1>He's not even completely a marionette </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

437
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

438
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.360
<v Speaker 1>but now it's up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

439
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Now it's up to him and his parents have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done basically what they could.</v>

440
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's really about right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

441
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

442
00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.030
<v Speaker 1>it's wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say psychologically.</v>

443
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.700
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

444
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:30.280
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
