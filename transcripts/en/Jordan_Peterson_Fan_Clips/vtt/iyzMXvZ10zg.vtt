1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so when,</v>

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>when you're telling your kids to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet and settled down,</v>

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.250
<v Speaker 1>it isn't because they're making a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>noise being in pain is because they're </v>

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.661
<v Speaker 1>running around like wild baboons having </v>
<v Speaker 1>a blast and disrupting things like mad,</v>

5
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you got kids,</v>

6
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>you got to settle down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:22.821
<v Speaker 1>like quit having so much fun and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of awful that you do that,</v>

8
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:28.401
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do and that's because the </v>

9
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:32.691
<v Speaker 1>emotions and the motivations have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought into like a relationship with </v>

10
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>one another within the person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

11
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing I remember with my son who is </v>

12
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's quite disagreeable by temperament,</v>

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a good thing as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned,</v>

14
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:47.661
<v Speaker 1>although it brings its own challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so with my daughter when she was </v>

15
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>misbehaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was pretty agreeable and uh,</v>

16
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she was misbehaving I can basically </v>

17
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.340
<v Speaker 1>just look at her and then she'd quit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>but my son was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just nothing.</v>

19
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

20
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not gonna go anywhere man.</v>

21
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 1>And so then I'd like tell them to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that really wasn't having much of an</v>

22
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:10.660
<v Speaker 1>effect either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just sort of made me laugh or runaway</v>

23
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a tough little rat and you</v>

24
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:19.761
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I would do with him is he would be </v>

25
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>doing something and it interfered and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd get upset and you know,</v>

26
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I get them to sit on the </v>

27
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>steps and I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when he was about to.</v>

28
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

29
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sit on the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's time out.</v>

30
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>You're going to sit on the steps until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got control of yourself and you </v>

31
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>can come back and be and play the game </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

32
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a civilized human being and then </v>

33
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>you're welcome again.</v>

34
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>And so he'd sit on the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so interesting to watch because </v>

35
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>he was just enraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'd sit there like,</v>

36
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen a two year old had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>temper tantrum?</v>

37
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>It's really quite the bloody phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever saw an adult do that,</v>

38
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>you'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd call nine one one right away.</v>

39
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

40
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen adults do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:03.621
<v Speaker 1>because people say with borderline </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder will have temper </v>

42
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>tantrums and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

43
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>you want to be about 30 feet away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person.</v>

44
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really.</v>

45
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>But in kids it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

46
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:16.011
<v Speaker 1>they're only this long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how much trouble can they really </v>

47
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:16.011
<v Speaker 1>cause?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

48
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just completely gone there.</v>

49
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Like on the floor of their face is red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just furious,</v>

50
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:25.941
<v Speaker 1>like way more furious than you ever get </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are even vaguely socialized </v>

51
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just outraged.</v>

52
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.250
<v Speaker 1>And they're kicking and hitting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and like,</v>

53
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like a little epileptic fit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

54
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:37.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're completely controlled by their </v>

55
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:39.291
<v Speaker 1>rage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we took care of one kid for awhile </v>

56
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>who he was actually a pushover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kid you could get him to behave by,</v>

57
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of shaking your finger at him.</v>

58
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>But his mother thought he was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough because he had her.</v>

59
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>He had her figured out and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things he would do is have a temperature</v>

60
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 1>temper tantrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And during the temper Tantrum,</v>

61
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>he would hold his bloody breath until he</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned blue.</v>

62
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try that,</v>

63
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as that's your homework,</v>

64
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>go home and go home and have a temper </v>
<v Speaker 1>tantrum and while you're doing it,</v>

65
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>hold your breath until you actually turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue.</v>

66
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like you won't be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the willpower of a two </v>

67
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.480
<v Speaker 1>year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

68
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>That little varmint man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just have a fit.</v>

69
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Then he'd hold his breath and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned blue.</v>

70
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

71
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

72
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>And we would just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them do it,</v>

73
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turned blue and everybody would be </v>

74
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.970
<v Speaker 1>gone and he'd come out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he just quit doing it.</v>

76
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I think he did it like twice and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out,</v>

77
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:31.350
<v Speaker 1>oh well that's a lot of work for very </v>
<v Speaker 1>little outcome.</v>

78
00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like two year olds are stupid.</v>

79
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not stupid.</v>

80
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>They're probably smarter than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not civilized by any stretch</v>

81
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

82
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:45.811
<v Speaker 1>back to my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd put them on the steps and he'd be </v>

83
00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:45.811
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

84
00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 1>it's just like in other aged and trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get himself together,</v>

85
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.820
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd wait a few,</v>

86
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.920
<v Speaker 1>few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind a strict rule which was as soon </v>

87
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 1>as you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're welcome again.</v>

88
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's completely under your control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

89
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you get yourself calmed down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come and talk to me again.</v>

90
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>If you're calm enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like you,</v>

91
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>then you're welcome back in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No grudge or nothing.</v>

92
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>And so it's harder than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people think they like their kids.</v>

93
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't be thinking that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to like they're little monsters and</v>

94
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very pushy and provocative.</v>

95
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 1>And so lots of parents do not like their</v>
<v Speaker 1>children and they do terrible things to </v>

96
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 1>them their whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's no joke and it's a very common.</v>

97
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was Freud's observation,</v>

98
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:33.691
<v Speaker 1>fundamental observation that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathology is rooted in the family </v>

99
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:34.950
<v Speaker 1>and you can be sure of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

100
00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:39.951
<v Speaker 1>And when you hear about some mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's done something terrible to her </v>

101
00:04:39.951 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which happens reasonably frequently,</v>

102
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well that she has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very terrible capacity to discipline.</v>

103
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.190
<v Speaker 1>The child is just provoked her and </v>
<v Speaker 1>provoked or unprovoked or provoked or </v>

104
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.491
<v Speaker 1>unprovoked or and it just happens to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a day where her new boyfriend left and </v>

105
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:57.720
<v Speaker 1>she's quite hung over and she got fired </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like that's the wrong data </v>

106
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Speaker 1>provoker and then she does something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not good and you read about it </v>

107
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

108
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>how could that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could anyone do that?</v>

109
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they do it.</v>

110
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And so and kids are very provocative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like little chimps,</v>

111
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.690
<v Speaker 1>chimps will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The adolescents will like throw little </v>

112
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>pebbles and sticks at the sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger males and bug them.</v>

113
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>And that teasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it is,</v>

114
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>that teasing turns into full fledged </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance challenge behavior.</v>

115
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Once the adolescent males get big enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

116
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're being provoked by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

117
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 1>which they provoke your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to figure out,</v>

118
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you exactly?</v>

119
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 1>What happens if I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if I do this,</v>

120
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how else are they going to figure it</v>

121
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

122
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:46.861
<v Speaker 1>he'd sit on the steps and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just enraged and trying to control </v>

123
00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:48.800
<v Speaker 1>himself and I've watched that and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I come back after about two minutes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever and he'd still be around,</v>

125
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well are,</v>

126
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

127
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>have you got yourself under control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready to get off the steps?</v>

128
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.870
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 1>he'd get himself under control and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd come back and you know,</v>

130
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 1>he'd be contrite and then I would like </v>
<v Speaker 1>him right away.</v>

131
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to watch that,</v>

132
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:14.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't like being dominated </v>

133
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:14.681
<v Speaker 1>by a two year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one does.</v>

134
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And so if the child hasn't mastered </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself and started to act in accordance</v>

135
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>with the prevailing social norms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't like them while you think,</v>

136
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:25.440
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will because you know,</v>

137
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

138
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't and no,</v>

139
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you're not a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't be thinking about that at all.</v>

140
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he was contrite,</v>

141
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>then he'd come and we'd just go on like </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing had happened because that's what</v>

142
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.350
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you get compliance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if the compliance is in the </v>

144
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 1>best interest of the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to reward it instantly,</v>

145
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

146
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.020
<v Speaker 1>That's the right thing to do because so </v>
<v Speaker 1>then and,</v>

147
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 1>and you could just see him gaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>control over himself.</v>

148
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 1>And so really what was happening is his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his mind,</v>

149
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>in his brain will say there was a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the psyche,</v>

150
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:07.451
<v Speaker 1>the ego that was starting to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated and starting to become a </v>

151
00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 1>continuous person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an identity,</v>

152
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 1>and it's fragile in two year olds and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be disrupted all the time.</v>

153
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>And it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're so hyper emotional.</v>

154
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:19.931
<v Speaker 1>It's fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little eagle and it doesn't have a </v>

155
00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:22.691
<v Speaker 1>lot of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what you want to do is reward it </v>

156
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>when it wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when it,</v>

157
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 1>when he gets control over the underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations,</v>

158
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>you want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

159
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 1>good work man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good work kid.</v>

160
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.300
<v Speaker 1>You did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

161
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you got yourself under control way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

162
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.060
<v Speaker 1>And the kids really happy about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's actually not that much fun </v>

163
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 1>to have a temper tantrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exhausting,</v>

164
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes you over question.</v>

165
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pat on the head or you know,</v>

166
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.830
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kind word,</v>

167
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

168
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.290
<v Speaker 1>or whatever earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:07:51.291 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention.</v>

170
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

171
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a great.</v>

172
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a great thing to know with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in your relationships here.</v>

173
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Here's the key to a good relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only one,</v>

174
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 1>but watch your person carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>

175
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.980
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whenever they do something that you </v>

176
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.261
<v Speaker 1>would like them to do more of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them that that was really good and </v>

177
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:18.371
<v Speaker 1>mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not manipulative because if </v>

178
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:18.371
<v Speaker 1>it's manipulative it won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to say,</v>

179
00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:19.580
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad you did that.</v>

180
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:24.581
<v Speaker 1>Did you have to be precise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you just did that I thought </v>

181
00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 1>was great and Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so nice that you've noticed.</v>

182
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they could notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

183
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that 20 times and the person will</v>

184
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:35.381
<v Speaker 1>be like the rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just pushing the lever for </v>

185
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:35.381
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

186
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:35.381
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

187
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's skinner established this bf skinner</v>

188
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.120
<v Speaker 1>noticed this a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reward is intensely useful in terms of </v>

189
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.831
<v Speaker 1>modifying behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is is that it's really </v>

190
00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>hard to notice when things are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

191
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:54.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're kind of prime to notice </v>

192
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.440
<v Speaker 1>when things are going wrong and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>use threat and punishment more often as </v>

193
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 1>agents of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of shaping the people that you're around</v>

194
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>because you know when everything's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

195
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

196
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's going right.</v>

197
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 1>It turns to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just assume it and that's,</v>

198
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

199
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>You want to pay attention and if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

200
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife,</v>

201
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 1>your whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mother,</v>

202
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>your sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want them to,</v>

203
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.520
<v Speaker 1>if you want to rectify your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with them,</v>

204
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:27.770
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying to do this in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulative wait,</v>

205
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.800
<v Speaker 1>won't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they do something that's </v>

206
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:32.800
<v Speaker 1>promoting harmony and peace and </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodwill,</v>

207
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like attend to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell them that you noticed.</v>

208
00:09:35.481 --> 00:09:40.481
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's so useful and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of your grudges and your </v>

209
00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:40.940
<v Speaker 1>resentment to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

210
00:09:40.941 --> 00:09:45.941
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't want you to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mad at your sister and then you know </v>

211
00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:45.941
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she does something good,</v>

212
00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:47.630
<v Speaker 1>you think there is no god damn way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to reward you for that.</v>

213
00:09:47.631 --> 00:09:49.910
<v Speaker 1>So you ignore her when she does </v>
<v Speaker 1>something good.</v>

214
00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:51.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's brilliant.</v>

215
00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:55.010
<v Speaker 1>That is because then you've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>punished her for doing what you want.</v>

216
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.620
<v Speaker 1>And people do that with their kids all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

217
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they let the kids dominate them.</v>

218
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Then they get resentful.</v>

219
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Then the kid will run up to them to show</v>
<v Speaker 1>them something that's kind of </v>

220
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.220
<v Speaker 1>spectacular and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not happy.</v>

221
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.090
<v Speaker 1>They'll think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

222
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.750
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:09.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

224
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

225
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:16.210
<v Speaker 1>little kid has all sad about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just learned something so.</v>

226
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's not perhaps what you want them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn.</v>

227
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:24.370
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to keep your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your relationship with your children </v>

228
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.821
<v Speaker 1>pristine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you can't hold a </v>

229
00:10:27.821 --> 00:10:31.451
<v Speaker 1>grudge or resent them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you have to help </v>

230
00:10:31.451 --> 00:10:32.270
<v Speaker 1>them learn how to behave so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked them.</v>

231
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.660
<v Speaker 1>And that way if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like them and you're kind of </v>

232
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.480
<v Speaker 1>sensible and maybe your partner also </v>
<v Speaker 1>likes them,</v>

233
00:10:38.481 --> 00:10:40.670
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a consensus going there,</v>

234
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.820
<v Speaker 1>there's a reasonable possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people will actually liked them </v>

235
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.250
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including other children.</v>

236
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 1>And then the world will open up to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.310
<v Speaker 1>then you'll bring them to people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>houses and the people will actually </v>

238
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.480
<v Speaker 1>smile at them and give them a pat on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head and instead of thinking,</v>

239
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:58.480
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Brad's coming to visit again,</v>

240
00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.710
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what will break this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

241
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:05.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a horrible thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your child to experience repetitively in</v>

242
00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:11.321
<v Speaker 1>situation after situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they learned is that adults have a </v>

243
00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:13.160
<v Speaker 1>false smile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're really lying all the time.</v>

244
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.770
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a bit of hell.</v>

245
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.080
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of children who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped in that.</v>

246
00:11:18.081 --> 00:11:23.081
<v Speaker 1>It's really awful to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see kids like that when I walked </v>

247
00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:23.081
<v Speaker 1>down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:26.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like their little doomed things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they are and you know,</v>

249
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.200
<v Speaker 1>they're screwed in 15 different ways and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way out of it.</v>

250
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:35.201
<v Speaker 1>It's really awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would not recommend that you do </v>

251
00:11:35.201 --> 00:11:39.311
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to notice that you're a bit </v>

252
00:11:39.311 --> 00:11:41.411
<v Speaker 1>of a monster or a lot of a monster and </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that you are much happier with </v>

253
00:11:42.951 --> 00:11:47.951
<v Speaker 1>the people around you when they behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>in accordance with reasonable source </v>

254
00:11:47.951 --> 00:11:51.160
<v Speaker 1>social norms and then you actually feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuinely connected to them and you want</v>

255
00:11:51.161 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 1>to work on their behalf so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything out.</v>

256
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.280
<v Speaker 1>But if you think you're a good person </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you'd never do anything that </v>

257
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.221
<v Speaker 1>was harmful to your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can just forget about that </v>

258
00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 1>because you'll never take it seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to actually learn.</v>

259
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.000
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

260
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:11.100
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live inside this story as far as I </v>

261
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 1>can tell and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind of put the story together inside</v>

262
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:17.581
<v Speaker 1>us to begin with and that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>between two and four when you're </v>

263
00:12:17.581 --> 00:12:20.970
<v Speaker 1>integrating those motivations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions into a relatively functional </v>

264
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.480
<v Speaker 1>unity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

265
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

266
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:28.051
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that does happen between two and </v>

267
00:12:28.051 --> 00:12:30.031
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have your kids socialized </v>

268
00:12:30.031 --> 00:12:32.191
<v Speaker 1>by the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore you might as well just forget </v>

269
00:12:32.191 --> 00:12:34.441
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that sounds terribly </v>

270
00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:36.691
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know the literature on trying to </v>

271
00:12:36.691 --> 00:12:39.370
<v Speaker 1>rectify antisocial behavior in children </v>
<v Speaker 1>and after the age of four,</v>

272
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:41.470
<v Speaker 1>it's virtually impossible no matter what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

273
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.970
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that kids who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are still acting like two year olds when</v>

274
00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:47.730
<v Speaker 1>they're for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:52.830
<v Speaker 1>they're twice as old as a two year old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of difference like four </v>

276
00:12:53.021 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 1>year olds in adult as far as the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old is concerned.</v>

277
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And so if the four year old is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting like a two year old,</v>

278
00:12:58.151 --> 00:13:03.151
<v Speaker 1>that's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And other four year olds will come up </v>

279
00:13:03.151 --> 00:13:05.020
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a little play invitation like the dog</v>

280
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:06.060
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

281
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:11.150
<v Speaker 1>the kid a two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four year old has no idea how to react </v>

282
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.530
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the more mature kid thinks,</v>

283
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.890
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how about a play with you?</v>

284
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:20.070
<v Speaker 1>And then that kid is isolated from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>peers and after four year mostly </v>

285
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.620
<v Speaker 1>socialized by your peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you just fall farther and farther</v>

286
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:24.520
<v Speaker 1>and farther behind.</v>

287
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.520
<v Speaker 1>You're more and more alienated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're more bitter and angry and no </v>

288
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.680
<v Speaker 1>wonder and it's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't rectify it so,</v>

289
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.980
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's useful to know.</v>

290
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:39.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like your job from two to four is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to turn your child,</v>

291
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.510
<v Speaker 1>help turn your child into a functional </v>
<v Speaker 1>unity and buy three.</v>

292
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:48.511
<v Speaker 1>They should be functional enough as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>unity within themselves so that they can</v>

293
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:53.620
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on a voluntary goal for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable length of time,</v>

294
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.400
<v Speaker 1>which is also why it's useful to let </v>
<v Speaker 1>them spend some time alone so that they </v>

295
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.820
<v Speaker 1>can learn to amuse themselves because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can use themselves,</v>

296
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:05.821
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be able to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>with other kids and then by three </v>

297
00:14:05.821 --> 00:14:09.180
<v Speaker 1>they're sorted together enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if another three year old comes </v>

298
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.791
<v Speaker 1>along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can at least play in parallel and </v>

299
00:14:11.791 --> 00:14:15.301
<v Speaker 1>may also start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may be able to start playing a </v>

300
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 1>cooperative game.</v>

301
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And so that's often a fantasy game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what the kids will do it.</v>

303
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they mediated verbally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's,</v>

304
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 1>it's more acted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a combination of the two.</v>

305
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.570
<v Speaker 1>They'll assign each other rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll do this with you too.</v>

306
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:33.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like let's have a tea party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

307
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:35.200
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

308
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:40.201
<v Speaker 1>it means let's sit down and act out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>act of sharing food and see if we can </v>

309
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:43.210
<v Speaker 1>get that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the kid saying.</v>

310
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a little tea party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

311
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:47.200
<v Speaker 1>it's very important because human being </v>
<v Speaker 1>shared food,</v>

312
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:49.210
<v Speaker 1>like this is a major thing to get right </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

313
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:54.630
<v Speaker 1>And so the kid will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you be the mom and I'll be the dad </v>

314
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.301
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll make little fort and that'll be </v>

315
00:14:58.301 --> 00:14:58.301
<v Speaker 1>our house and we'll go in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll run our roles and you know,</v>

316
00:14:58.301 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 1>we're acting out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're acting out family.</v>

317
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.080
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

318
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.990
<v Speaker 1>if were both reasonably civilized as </v>
<v Speaker 1>three year olds,</v>

319
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:11.170
<v Speaker 1>we can concentrate on that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can establish that little fictional </v>

320
00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:11.510
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>

321
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:16.520
<v Speaker 1>we can negotiate our mutual goal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we can run the simulation.</v>

322
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:21.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's what kids are doing when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretending it's bloody </v>

323
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.670
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's play man.</v>

324
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brilliant.</v>
