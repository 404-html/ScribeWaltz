1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.080
<v Speaker 1>And No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>the evidence that are hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

3
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Work is everywhere because everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>around us works all the time.</v>

4
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Are you on hers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Lee tells two interesting stories in</v>

5
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>her book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infidel,</v>

6
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:12.470
<v Speaker 1>which is a great book by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.630
<v Speaker 1>she came from Africa and from a country </v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't very functional and when she</v>

8
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:23.181
<v Speaker 1>came to Holland she said there were two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that really amazed her and this </v>

9
00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:27.261
<v Speaker 1>really struck me because you know now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get lucky and you can see </v>

10
00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>the world you live in from an outsider's</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

11
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.891
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to see through someone else's </v>

12
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:35.481
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said the first thing that knocked </v>

13
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>her off her feet was waiting for a bus </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

14
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>in Amsterdam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the,</v>

15
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's standing at the bus stop and </v>

16
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a pole there and there's digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign on the pole and the digital sign </v>

17
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>says when the next bus is going to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>and counts down.</v>

18
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>And then when it hits zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bus appears.</v>

19
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just,</v>

20
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:56.631
<v Speaker 1>she just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she absolutely could not believe that </v>

21
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there could be a sign that told you</v>

22
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:02.481
<v Speaker 1>when the bus would come and that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would change and the bus would actually </v>

23
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>appear and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

25
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>that's a miracle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>That's an absolute miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

27
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to think that through,</v>

28
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of timing and organization </v>

29
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>and and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reliability,</v>

30
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>mechanical reliability and sociological </v>
<v Speaker 1>or social organization and dedication on</v>

31
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:24.531
<v Speaker 1>the part of the bus drivers in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire company and the organization of </v>

32
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:27.351
<v Speaker 1>the whole city and the state to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that possible is absolutely beyond </v>

33
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's time to,</v>

34
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>well perhaps not the second but to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds or something like that.</v>

35
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely beyond belief and her</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to comprehend.</v>

36
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>That was the correct response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other things she was amazed</v>

37
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>by was that you could go talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>policemen and they would help you.</v>

38
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 1>That was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just a no go for her because </v>

39
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>for her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her experience was policemen were there </v>

40
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>to shake you down and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hurt you.</v>

41
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>And so you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

42
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't dwell on that point any longer.</v>

44
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's absolutely ridiculous,</v>

45
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>blind to make the assumption that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies in functioning Western </v>

46
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>democracies are fundamentally predicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>on power and tyranny.</v>

47
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.460
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I can use a biological example too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would place me outside of the </v>

49
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>postmodern realm of argument because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists don't believe in biology,</v>

50
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:31.191
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they act like they do because they </v>

51
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:31.191
<v Speaker 1>all die.</v>

52
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:31.191
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

53
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>this primatologist named.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you two stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

56
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Because these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are really useful.</v>

57
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:49.761
<v Speaker 1>So the ones about rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got this story from Jaak Panksepp </v>

58
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:53.390
<v Speaker 1>who is a great neuroscientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book called an effect of </v>

59
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.181
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is on my reading list </v>

60
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:56.181
<v Speaker 1>that's on my website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good book,</v>

61
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>affective neuroscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great scientist.</v>

62
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the who he learned that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned that rats laugh.</v>

63
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>They laugh out ultrasonically like bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to take a look with a</v>

64
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>pencil eraser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they laugh,</v>

65
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.840
<v Speaker 1>but you have to record it and then slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>it down and then you can hear them and </v>

66
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.840
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>rats laugh like who was creating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grant for that?</v>

68
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>What kind of idiocy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

69
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

70
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't,</v>

71
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get ahead of yourself here.</v>

72
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was showing that,</v>

73
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>that that capacity for social </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>

74
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.510
<v Speaker 1>for social interaction that was mediated</v>
<v Speaker 1>by physiological touch activated the </v>

75
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

76
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>activated the same circuits in rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't people and that those are</v>

77
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>actual biological circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we share them even with rats.</v>

78
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats are quite similar to human beings.</v>

79
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:50.430
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say especially postmodernists,</v>

80
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>but I won't.</v>

81
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

82
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>and so the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

83
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little rats giggle when you tickle </v>

84
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.950
<v Speaker 1>them is actually extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

85
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.690
<v Speaker 1>He also identified surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking too much lately.</v>

86
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 1>He also identified the primary place </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit and mammals.</v>

87
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big deal too from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific perspective.</v>

88
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:21.781
<v Speaker 1>That's like discovering a new continent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like discovering a whole brain system </v>

89
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>that people really didn't know existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

90
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.630
<v Speaker 1>So here's a little story about rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young rats like to engage in rough and </v>

91
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>tumble play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially juvenile males.</v>

92
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It's also the case for puppies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever had a puppy,</v>

93
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.320
<v Speaker 1>dogs are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They liked to wrestle and it's one of </v>

94
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.531
<v Speaker 1>the things that male human beings tend </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with their offspring and it's a </v>

95
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:44.011
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good thing like rough and tumble </v>

96
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:46.651
<v Speaker 1>play with children really helps </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialize them because it helps them </v>

97
00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:49.740
<v Speaker 1>figure out the difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch and even rough touch and pain,</v>

98
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you're doing </v>

99
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.800
<v Speaker 1>when you're rough and tumble playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the little kid is,</v>

100
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you throw them up in the air and you're </v>

101
00:04:59.221 --> 00:04:59.221
<v Speaker 1>wrestling around.</v>

102
00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I built my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had two couches when my kids were </v>

103
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.961
<v Speaker 1>little that were sort of face to face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we built this little wrestling ring </v>

104
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 1>and I used to go in there and pound them</v>
<v Speaker 1>half to death every night,</v>

105
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they loved that.</v>

106
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

107
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>they get so excited about that they love</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so much.</v>

108
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:15.151
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason for that is like you're </v>

109
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:17.821
<v Speaker 1>stretching out their bodies and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing them that they can't put their </v>

110
00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:19.310
<v Speaker 1>thumb in your eye and you're teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to be graceful and,</v>

111
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:24.311
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're teaching them the difference </v>

112
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>between something new that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the body and something painful.</v>

113
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.630
<v Speaker 1>You're really teaching them to dance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this really complicated </v>

114
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>physiological dance that that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicative of a socialized being.</v>

115
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why women like men who can</v>
<v Speaker 1>dance by the way because it seems shows </v>

116
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>that you can pay attention to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else first of all,</v>

117
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:46.501
<v Speaker 1>that you're coordinated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even more importantly that you can </v>

118
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:49.021
<v Speaker 1>take the fact of your coordination and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinate that with someone else's </v>

119
00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>coordination.</v>

120
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's very primal and </v>

121
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.191
<v Speaker 1>physiological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's built right into your body and </v>

122
00:05:56.191 --> 00:05:56.191
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble play helps with that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

123
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats also like to rough and tumble play </v>

124
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>for much the same reasons and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of pretty much all social mammals.</v>

125
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.840
<v Speaker 1>So you can tell that rats like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he,</v>

126
00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know if a rat like something?</v>

127
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll work for it and one of the ways </v>

128
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you can figure out if rat wants to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>for something is that no,</v>

129
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 1>you get them in a state where maybe he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate for whatever he's working for </v>

130
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.111
<v Speaker 1>and you can put a little spring on them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and figure out how hardy poles to go </v>

131
00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows where he's going to get that.</v>

132
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 1>And then you can measure the force that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's willing to apply and that gives you</v>

133
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>a rough estimate of his motivation.</v>

134
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe ask a bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>press like a,</v>

135
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a coke,</v>

136
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.760
<v Speaker 1>cocaine addicted rats to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to receive the reward and you can count </v>

137
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.081
<v Speaker 1>rate of bar pressing and you can get an </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimate of how excited the route is to </v>

138
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 1>go do whatever it is the rats going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

139
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:46.181
<v Speaker 1>And so panksepp used to put rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It pair them one riot against the other </v>

140
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 1>in kind of a play arena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a very big thing.</v>

141
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

142
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>these were juvenile males and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>work to do that.</v>

143
00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they liked it and then maybe one rat </v>

144
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>was 10 percent bigger than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you paired them,</v>

145
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
<v Speaker 1>the big rat would beat the little rat </v>
<v Speaker 1>because 10 percent weight advantage was </v>

146
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>enough to make the bigger dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>So then they established basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance and submission.</v>

148
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>You might think about that as a power </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

149
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 1>And to some degree it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more complicated than that.</v>

150
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>And this is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

151
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.510
<v Speaker 1>So the rats play together once and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big rat pins the little rat really </v>

152
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:30.221
<v Speaker 1>very much like wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rats wrestle just like people </v>

153
00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:30.221
<v Speaker 1>wrestle.</v>

154
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 1>And if you pair them together then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>big rat can pin the little rat.</v>

155
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you've got dominant subordinate </v>

156
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.000
<v Speaker 1>rat roughly speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

157
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 1>but then you see if you stop the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment there,</v>

158
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:48.941
<v Speaker 1>you'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the rats play to establish </v>

159
00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:49.400
<v Speaker 1>dominance and submission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that rats don't just</v>

160
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 1>play once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they play many,</v>

161
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>

162
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's also the case with human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings is that you don't just play once,</v>

163
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.240
<v Speaker 1>you play many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times and there's a difference </v>

164
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.750
<v Speaker 1>between the rules of a game and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of a set of games.</v>

165
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:08.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's so unbelievably important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you keep that in mind because we'll </v>

166
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:08.290
<v Speaker 1>return to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

167
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 1>the next time the two rats get together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little rat has to ask the big rat to</v>

168
00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:17.261
<v Speaker 1>play it because the rule basically is </v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate entity asks dominant entity </v>

169
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:17.261
<v Speaker 1>to play.</v>

170
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 1>And so the little rat does what mammals </v>
<v Speaker 1>do to play,</v>

171
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of put their paws down and put</v>

172
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 1>the rear end up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit up in the air.</v>

173
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 1>You see dogs do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unless you're completely clueless,</v>

174
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:34.091
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean he's going for your </v>

175
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:36.191
<v Speaker 1>throat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>means he wants you to whack them on the </v>

176
00:08:36.191 --> 00:08:36.191
<v Speaker 1>side of the head so he can sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend to bite you.</v>

177
00:08:36.191 --> 00:08:36.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

178
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious if you've played </v>
<v Speaker 1>with dogs and children.</v>

179
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

180
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I make that comparison because dogs </v>

181
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 1>and children understand each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

182
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>They're pack animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They followed the same basic rules.</v>

183
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 1>They know how to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can become friends,</v>

184
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.160
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you wouldn't have them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>pets.</v>

185
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean the dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the children.</v>

186
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little rat ass,</v>

187
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>the big Rut to play big wrap things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

188
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

189
00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll will play.</v>

190
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 1>They wrestle and you pair them multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

191
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:09.261
<v Speaker 1>Well if you pair the multiple times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you find is that less the big rat </v>

192
00:09:09.261 --> 00:09:12.411
<v Speaker 1>lets the little rat win 30 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time the little rat won't ask the </v>

193
00:09:12.411 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 1>big rat to play anymore and that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

194
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:14.260
<v Speaker 1>well who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

195
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Like why is that important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's really important.</v>

196
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 1>That's a really important discovery </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it shows you that that even rats</v>

197
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 1>have a set set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sense of fair play that emerges across</v>

198
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:27.460
<v Speaker 1>iterated games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sits,</v>

199
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:32.510
<v Speaker 1>it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's evidence for the biological </v>

200
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>instantiation of a social morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal,</v>

201
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:35.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big discovery and,</v>

202
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.130
<v Speaker 1>and it shows you that even at the level </v>
<v Speaker 1>of rats,</v>

203
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:43.131
<v Speaker 1>they're very social animals by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interactions between rats,</v>

204
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>her are mediated by something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of fairness or justice,</v>

205
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 1>and so that's extremely cool because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

206
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:55.971
<v Speaker 1>we tend to think of animals as having </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies and that's </v>

207
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:58.941
<v Speaker 1>predicated on power and that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the bloody postmodernists </v>

208
00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:02.691
<v Speaker 1>don't believe in biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they extend that analogy up to human </v>

209
00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:02.691
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>
