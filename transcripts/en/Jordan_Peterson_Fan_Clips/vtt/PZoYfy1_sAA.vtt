1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.360
<v Speaker 1>The system in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union,</v>

2
00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>which was a collection of states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an empire,</v>

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 1>and the system that was established in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China and the system that still exists </v>

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.061
<v Speaker 1>in Korea as a remnant of the Cold War </v>
<v Speaker 1>and systems in Southeast Asia and in </v>

5
00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:26.791
<v Speaker 1>Africa were all predicated on Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions,</v>

6
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions that were Utopian in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature</v>

7
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 2>and that</v>

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.130
<v Speaker 1>posited a utopian future where property </v>
<v Speaker 1>was held in common and everyone had </v>

9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 1>enough and everyone was called upon to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do what they could write from each </v>

10
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>according to his ability to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to his need,</v>

11
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>which is a lovely sentiment and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine how it would be attractive even </v>

12
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>intellectually because of course other </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

13
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.860
<v Speaker 1>all other systems produce vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>disparities in income.</v>

14
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like a natural law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually governed by.</v>

15
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 1>You can model it</v>

16
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>with a distribution called the prieto </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution and the prieto </v>

17
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like this.</v>

18
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like a normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>

19
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 1>A lot of you guys have been told about </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal distributions and how many things</v>

20
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.910
<v Speaker 1>follow a normal distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most things,</v>

21
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>but that's really a limited case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can understand that prieto </v>

22
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:35.570
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

23
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>You've all played monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume at the beginning.</v>

24
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has the same amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will include property,</v>

25
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.200
<v Speaker 1>the same amount of wealth and then what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens as the game progresses and </v>

26
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.861
<v Speaker 1>really as a function of chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know yet you have to use your </v>

27
00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:57.011
<v Speaker 1>head a little bit monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the basic rule is just buy </v>

28
00:01:57.011 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>everything you can get your hands on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then trade meanly,</v>

29
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:04.691
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the beginning everybody has the </v>

30
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>same amount and then as you begin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

31
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.430
<v Speaker 1>if you had enough players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would develop an,</v>

32
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>a normal distribution because some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would win,</v>

33
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>see relatively consistently and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would lose relatively </v>

34
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>consistently.</v>

35
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>And so the money starts to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed in a normal distribution.</v>

36
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:26.111
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about money and the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about lots of things is that zero is </v>

37
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:33.641
<v Speaker 1>involved in zero is a weird place </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're playing a trading game</v>

38
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 1>and you hit zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're done.</v>

39
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very hard to recover from zero </v>

40
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to recover.</v>

41
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're doomed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly,</v>

42
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell you've got some resources,</v>

43
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.920
<v Speaker 1>but there's gonna be some crisis when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you land on some hotel and you're going </v>

44
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>to get wiped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it,</v>

45
00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 1>so there's a point at which you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>headed for zero.</v>

46
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Even if you have something you know and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be rescued by luck,</v>

47
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>but you know when you're doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is that as you continue </v>

48
00:03:14.091 --> 00:03:19.091
<v Speaker 1>to play monopoly more and more people </v>
<v Speaker 1>stack up at zero and fewer and fewer </v>

49
00:03:20.991 --> 00:03:24.980
<v Speaker 1>people have more and more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when the game is over,</v>

50
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.910
<v Speaker 1>everyone has nothing except one person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all of it.</v>

51
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing about that is that in </v>

52
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.640
<v Speaker 1>some sense that's how trading games </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

53
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got.</v>

54
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.960
<v Speaker 1>You might wonder why is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why there is any quality in this society</v>

55
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>and it's easy to consider that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the society is corrupt and </v>

56
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.960
<v Speaker 1>perhaps no society is ours somewhat or </v>
<v Speaker 1>horribly corrupt.</v>

57
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the variation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no society that's without.</v>

58
00:03:52.221 --> 00:03:57.221
<v Speaker 1>It's criminal and criminal element,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed element anyways.</v>

59
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Trading Games tend to produce a prieto </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution so that very many people </v>

60
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.240
<v Speaker 1>have very little and a tiny minority </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a tremendous amount.</v>

61
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the one percent that you hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

62
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know the thing about that one </v>

63
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.090
<v Speaker 1>percent is that that's happened in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>society that's ever been studied.</v>

64
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governmental system is and it certainly </v>

65
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>handled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly happened under the Soviets,</v>

66
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a lot of people who had </v>

67
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.350
<v Speaker 1>enough zero so they just died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

68
00:04:30.351 --> 00:04:31.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

69
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>the Utopian dream was completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>unimplementable for a variety of very </v>

70
00:04:38.751 --> 00:04:43.751
<v Speaker 1>complex reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that it's very hard to fight </v>

71
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:47.411
<v Speaker 1>against that distribution pattern when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are trading because mirror </v>

72
00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:49.790
<v Speaker 1>statistics will do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other things that,</v>

73
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.420
<v Speaker 1>and I should tell you as well that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prieto distribution government governs a</v>

74
00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:54.320
<v Speaker 1>lot of things.</v>

75
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember properly last year there </v>

76
00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:05.381
<v Speaker 1>was something like a million English </v>
<v Speaker 1>language books published and I think 500</v>

77
00:05:06.531 --> 00:05:08.660
<v Speaker 1>of them sold more than 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>copies,</v>

78
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Speaker 1>which is none,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:14.951
<v Speaker 1>That's none of that 500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be sure that one of them was by </v>

80
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:18.791
<v Speaker 1>Stephen King and he took half the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's like five authors in the</v>

81
00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:23.600
<v Speaker 1>English language who are on every </v>
<v Speaker 1>airport,</v>

82
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.310
<v Speaker 1>paperback stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupying the top rung,</v>

83
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's massive real estate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Because it's replicated everywhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're so prominent and because</v>

85
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:39.911
<v Speaker 1>there are no names when people are in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurry and they just want something to </v>

86
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:44.081
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just grabbed that and then more </v>

87
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:44.081
<v Speaker 1>money goes to those people and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

88
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>success breeds success and failure </v>
<v Speaker 1>breeds failure and it's not necessarily </v>

89
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.020
<v Speaker 1>linear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

90
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a really difficult thing to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and it's hard on societies because </v>

91
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we do know is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.940
<v Speaker 1>as you stretch out the inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make men particularly on the lower </v>

93
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>end of the distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more likely to be aggressive.</v>

94
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.600
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like imagine every man has </v>
<v Speaker 1>a threshold for violence and status is </v>

95
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 1>important to men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's not important to women,</v>

96
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different kind of status.</v>

97
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:25.661
<v Speaker 1>It's status is important to men because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that makes them </v>

98
00:06:25.661 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>marketable as partners to women's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually turns out to be quite important</v>

99
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 1>to men than men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men tend to compete with one another for</v>

100
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:36.881
<v Speaker 1>status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy position and in a really </v>

101
00:06:36.881 --> 00:06:40.631
<v Speaker 1>unequal society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're like a low rung guy then and </v>

102
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:46.361
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any opportunity to rise </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the society isn't structured so </v>

103
00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:50.711
<v Speaker 1>that there's mobility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the more aggressive guys tend to </v>

104
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 1>turn into criminality and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you could say there's a threshold</v>

105
00:06:56.331 --> 00:07:01.331
<v Speaker 1>for criminality and the more inequality </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure you put on a particular area,</v>

106
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.520
<v Speaker 1>geographic or political area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more inequality pressure you put on </v>

107
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.401
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more men slip past that threshold </v>

108
00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>and into criminality.</v>

109
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been pretty good studies done of</v>

110
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.580
<v Speaker 1>drug gang in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the best one.</v>

111
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>As sociologist actually went and hung </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with a drug gang for.</v>

112
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>He got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the drug gang leader was.</v>

113
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say necessarily narcissistic,</v>

114
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:36.161
<v Speaker 1>but that might be a reasonable way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it and he was kinda happy</v>

115
00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:41.381
<v Speaker 1>with the idea of maybe being a subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a book and and so this guy was able </v>

116
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 1>to associate with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to know them quite well.</v>

117
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:52.420
<v Speaker 1>And then the housing project in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gang was how housed was slated for </v>

118
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:57.551
<v Speaker 1>demolition and the gang broke up and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>got the books because the books and what</v>

119
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 1>he found was the average street drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealer,</v>

120
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.040
<v Speaker 1>first of all was employed in another job</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well and was making far less than </v>

121
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:12.341
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the guys further up the chain of </v>

122
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:16.490
<v Speaker 1>course followed the prieto distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a tiny minority of them</v>

123
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:18.470
<v Speaker 1>who were raking in a tremendous amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of loot.</v>

124
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.860
<v Speaker 1>And the guys at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just waiting around for the </v>

125
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>possibility that they could rise up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

126
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:27.670
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty violent game.</v>

127
00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>So the chances that someone is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be</v>

128
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.780
<v Speaker 1>taken out is pretty high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a little slot opens up for some</v>

129
00:08:36.781 --> 00:08:41.781
<v Speaker 1>opportunistic second rater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps he can move up the </v>

130
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:46.641
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the prieto distribution,</v>

131
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 1>governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of other things too.</v>

132
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned it governs the popularity </v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

133
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>the sales of books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also,</v>

134
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.680
<v Speaker 1>it also characterizes the distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything that people produce.</v>

135
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.530
<v Speaker 1>So if you think of creative production </v>
<v Speaker 1>of any sort,</v>

136
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>artistic production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial production,</v>

137
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.100
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything fails</v>

138
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 1>and a few things succeed beyond anyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildest imagination.</v>

139
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Apple's a good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

140
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean the iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their competitors,</v>

141
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:33.021
<v Speaker 1>but is it extraordinarily dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>product and they rake in billions of </v>

142
00:09:33.021 --> 00:09:33.021
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

143
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if apple is valued at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion dollars,</v>

144
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of money.</v>

145
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 1>And I think if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something like this,</v>

146
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I probably have the figures wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the top 40 people,</v>

147
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.160
<v Speaker 1>the richest 40 people in the world have </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much money as the bottom 2 billion </v>

148
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.600
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

149
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they're stuffing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mattresses with that money or they have </v>

150
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.191
<v Speaker 1>a skyscraper full of cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That money is out in the economy doing </v>

151
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 1>whatever money does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

152
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 1>you can't spend $28,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars,</v>

153
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 1>so and sometimes you can even do some </v>
<v Speaker 1>good with it.</v>

154
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:15.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates seems to be doing something </v>

155
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:18.621
<v Speaker 1>reasonable with his money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason I'm telling you this is </v>

156
00:10:18.621 --> 00:10:22.011
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>know is that this proclivity for </v>

157
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:27.621
<v Speaker 1>inequality is pervasive among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative products of human beings.</v>

158
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>It's the case with with goals scored in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey.</v>

159
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.650
<v Speaker 1>My son told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a reliable source on hockey </v>

160
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.650
<v Speaker 1>statistics that</v>

161
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.400
<v Speaker 1>if Wayne Gretzky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't count any of the points </v>

162
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.861
<v Speaker 1>that Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he still had enough points just with </v>

163
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.170
<v Speaker 1>assists to have more points than any </v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey player that ever played.</v>

164
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.560
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you even at the upper end of,</v>

165
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.030
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the distribution or some person who's</v>

166
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.830
<v Speaker 1>hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so good at what they do.</v>

167
00:10:57.831 --> 00:11:02.831
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another person that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much better than them that it's not </v>

168
00:11:02.831 --> 00:11:04.130
<v Speaker 1>even comparable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

169
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.120
<v Speaker 1>And the benefits flow to people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that position.</v>

170
00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:13.121
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand why I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because now let's say you start writing </v>

171
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:18.490
<v Speaker 1>and you get a book and a rare thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare things to have happened and </v>

172
00:11:18.921 --> 00:11:20.450
<v Speaker 1>then some people read it and they like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

173
00:11:20.451 --> 00:11:23.450
<v Speaker 1>and then of course it's much more likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll get a next book.</v>

174
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.840
<v Speaker 1>And if people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's even more likely that you'll </v>

175
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.421
<v Speaker 1>get a third book and then people start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know who you are and then because </v>

176
00:11:31.421 --> 00:11:34.721
<v Speaker 1>they know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they phone you up and offer you </v>

177
00:11:34.721 --> 00:11:36.731
<v Speaker 1>opportunities and your network grows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this exponential increase in </v>

178
00:11:37.941 --> 00:11:42.941
<v Speaker 1>your reach and your capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>production and more and more flows to </v>

179
00:11:42.951 --> 00:11:43.190
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
