1
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>First of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great pleasure being here.</v>

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.610
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome to see you live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I basically got into your work's just </v>

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>earlier this year and I had an original </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

5
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>but your talk today kind of made me </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide to change my mind.</v>

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.100
<v Speaker 1>do you feel as though would you agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me in the sentiment that the left </v>

8
00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:27.361
<v Speaker 1>has pushed so hard for total control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our society over the last however many </v>

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost to a point where saying 2013</v>

10
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>was a different time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 1>would you say that because they pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>so hard,</v>

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 1>they've created this backlash and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backlash created caused them to backlash</v>

13
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>back again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they doubled down with their ideology</v>

14
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>and then they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lose another argument,</v>

15
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.520
<v Speaker 1>they lose another ideological war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew lose another me more and they </v>

16
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>double down and they doubled down again </v>
<v Speaker 1>and again.</v>

17
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>And they can't seem to mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't seem to argue.</v>

18
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>They can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>

19
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to have an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

20
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>And as an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interpretation of what you were </v>

21
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>saying there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there doesn't seem to be any,</v>

22
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any care of what's right with them.</v>

23
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>They just want power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just want,</v>

24
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>they just want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you agree with the sentiment that </v>

26
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>they're burning themselves out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating the mass red pilling of the,</v>

27
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:27.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative movement that we see going </v>

28
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.811
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you possibly think that maybe </v>

29
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>they've committed suicide and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talks like this,</v>

30
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 1>people like yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro and others who talk to </v>

31
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>people like the subjects that we do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>taboo of nowadays?</v>

32
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly that this,</v>

33
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>this is the answer to defeat the leftist</v>
<v Speaker 1>stranglehold on our society.</v>

34
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I will untangle some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

35
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.720
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first observation is a really </v>

37
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>interesting one because you know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things can go out of hand very,</v>

38
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:02.271
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they do that is because </v>

39
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:02.271
<v Speaker 1>of positive feedback loops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

40
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>the thing that Kurzweil talks about is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive feedback that an intelligent </v>

41
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.061
<v Speaker 1>machine makes another intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine that makes another intelligent </v>

42
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a positive feedback loop.</v>

43
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>And that can spiral upwards out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>control very rapidly.</v>

44
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's when polarization is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

45
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I tap you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tap me,</v>

46
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>I slapped you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you punch me well up.</v>

47
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>It goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I think that's partly why in the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>

49
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an injunction that says turn the</v>

50
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>other cheek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resist not evil.</v>

51
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise you get into a </v>

52
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.961
<v Speaker 1>positive feedback loop and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>better look the hell out and things can </v>

53
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>tilt very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

54
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do,</v>

55
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>look at what happened in World War One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one expected that.</v>

56
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:50.481
<v Speaker 1>It was like one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one relatively minor member,</v>

57
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 1>I think of the aristocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

58
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>was assassinated in one minor little </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

59
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything fell apart.</v>

60
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's positive feedback loops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

61
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what we're in right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've got to be.</v>

62
00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:10.341
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really chaotic time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say maintain self control</v>

63
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>and don't aim to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

64
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because winning,</v>

65
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>that's not peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to aim for peace.</v>

66
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this talk coming up in November</v>

67
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:27.241
<v Speaker 1>11th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm quite worried about it because I </v>

68
00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>know there's going to be protesters </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and that they'd been emboldened by</v>

69
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they shut the torque down </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and I want to make a video.</v>

70
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:36.841
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably do it tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling everyone that comes to that </v>

71
00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:39.301
<v Speaker 1>meeting to like watch their bloody step </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stay out of the gutter because you </v>

72
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at,</v>

73
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>we're at.</v>

74
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>We're at a point now where under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong circumstances,</v>

75
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>if the wrong person does the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

76
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>that the consequences will be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

77
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Now we can't predict which action is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to precipitate that and or even if</v>

78
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 1>that will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's chaotic enough so that it could</v>

79
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

80
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:10.260
<v Speaker 1>also govern yourselves accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is,</v>

81
00:04:10.261 --> 00:04:15.261
<v Speaker 1>is that there are people who would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy if there was blood running in the </v>

82
00:04:15.261 --> 00:04:18.781
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the same sort of people that </v>

83
00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:18.781
<v Speaker 1>shoot up high schools or kill innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>elementary school kids just to show what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're made of and what they believe.</v>

85
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the rest of us,</v>

86
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:30.181
<v Speaker 1>like hopefully calmer heads can prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it really is important not to </v>

87
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like fighting with your wife.</v>

88
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't when you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to live with her.</v>

89
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.360
<v Speaker 1>She can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you can solve the problem and </v>

90
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.631
<v Speaker 1>bring about peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got to practice doing </v>

91
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practice restraint now.</v>

92
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.210
<v Speaker 1>And remember too that these people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about who are radical </v>

93
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.901
<v Speaker 1>leftist is most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not like they're 95 percent like</v>

94
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you pull them out of the mob,</v>

95
00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 1>they're just like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your neighbors.</v>

96
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen year old kid who's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>clueless and rebellious.</v>

97
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who you might even like you put them</v>

98
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>in the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole different thing.</v>

99
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:10.600
<v Speaker 1>And so you gotta remember that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

100
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>the fear of social isolation kind of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're acting.</v>

101
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that they're possessed by </v>

102
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.130
<v Speaker 1>these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

103
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>but only partially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.970
<v Speaker 1>you hardly find it full blooded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely committed radical leftist </v>

105
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>activist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>like there are some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not very many.</v>

107
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Most of it is just fragmentary behavior.</v>

108
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.440
<v Speaker 1>And you have to remember that like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the students come out to protest me was </v>

109
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.000
<v Speaker 1>a case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly at mcmaster,</v>

110
00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:43.001
<v Speaker 1>I have to remember these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not much different than my kids.</v>

111
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>They are when they're in a stupid mob </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind a hammer and sickle flag,</v>

112
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

113
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to make a low </v>

114
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.140
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homogenous representation of them.</v>

115
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so.</v>

116
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 1>That's why again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think instead of winning,</v>

117
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>you turn to your own development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you turn to your own development,</v>

118
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:10.541
<v Speaker 1>you do what you can to stop doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you're doing that aren't </v>

119
00:06:10.541 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>good because you're not going to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody if you do that,</v>

120
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>all you're going to do is help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And otherwise you'll participate in this</v>

121
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 1>polarization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's unless you want that,</v>

122
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a dark part of people that it's </v>

123
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>part of the part that voted for trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like to burn things to the ground.</v>

124
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like the hell I know how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt when they went into the voting </v>

125
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.400
<v Speaker 1>booth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like Hillary,</v>

126
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Hillary or trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

127
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:38.891
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of a thing to say to hell </v>

128
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:38.891
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:42.760
<v Speaker 1>although I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could certainly understand that </v>

130
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.861
<v Speaker 1>sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to be careful and all of you </v>

131
00:06:44.951 --> 00:06:49.951
<v Speaker 1>people who are here who are advocates of</v>
<v Speaker 1>free speech and who are theoretically </v>

132
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.500
<v Speaker 1>happy to come hear me speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I really do believe in.</v>

133
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:58.501
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe this and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something I learned in part from social </v>

134
00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.511
<v Speaker 1>knits and then part from y'all missed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the way that you set the world </v>

135
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>straight is by constraining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence in your own heart.</v>

136
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

137
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:11.021
<v Speaker 1>That's no easy thing and that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>voyage for people to go on if they want </v>

138
00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 1>something difficult and worthwhile to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

139
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

140
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a quick thing.</v>

141
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.330
<v Speaker 2>We're not gonna have time for pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're.</v>

142
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're yours is the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

143
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sorry to everybody else,</v>

144
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:27.400
<v Speaker 2>but you're the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

145
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Hi Dr Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming.</v>

146
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my question is a little bit off topic </v>

147
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.760
<v Speaker 1>from everything else tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really wanted to hear what you had</v>

148
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:44.761
<v Speaker 1>to say about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work in residence life here at UBC and</v>

149
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.450
<v Speaker 1>in the community where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were recently affected by a suicide </v>

150
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.030
<v Speaker 1>of someone who lived in our community </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that I was upset about it,</v>

151
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.610
<v Speaker 1>not just because obviously it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible thing to have happen,</v>

152
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.150
<v Speaker 1>but also because Rez life in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

153
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:06.151
<v Speaker 1>like they talk all this talk about self </v>
<v Speaker 1>care and your mental health is so </v>

154
00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:08.620
<v Speaker 1>important to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then things like this still happen.</v>

155
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you think like,</v>

156
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.710
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the university should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be doing to keep stuff like this from </v>

157
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.461
<v Speaker 1>happening in the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

158
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.740
<v Speaker 1>it's not self evident that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university's responsibility and the </v>

159
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:31.570
<v Speaker 1>reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it isn't.</v>

160
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

161
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it's not self evident that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because different institutions can </v>

162
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.241
<v Speaker 1>only do so many things and we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>already recording the universities to </v>

163
00:08:42.241 --> 00:08:46.890
<v Speaker 1>educate and to act as substitute parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly.</v>

164
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:52.140
<v Speaker 1>And to take on the role of judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jury and executioner as</v>

165
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.490
<v Speaker 3>there are more,</v>

166
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 1>what should be criminal cases being </v>
<v Speaker 1>handled within the university?</v>

167
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

168
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:01.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

169
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.180
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could ask the broader question is,</v>

170
00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:13.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do to help people be </v>

171
00:09:13.181 --> 00:09:16.370
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently in love with life so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't wish to end it now?</v>

172
00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:21.371
<v Speaker 1>And I've tried to puzzle through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and that's partly why </v>

173
00:09:21.371 --> 00:09:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I've written the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>

174
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.340
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why I've produced the online</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs that I've produced,</v>

175
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we know that if you do,</v>

176
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.880
<v Speaker 1>if you have students do the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program,</v>

177
00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:36.881
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're much less likely to drop out of </v>

178
00:09:36.881 --> 00:09:36.890
<v Speaker 1>university about 30 percent less likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their grades go up.</v>

179
00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:41.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's especially true if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>male and marginalized.</v>

180
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.730
<v Speaker 1>It has a bigger impact on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>

181
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.110
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to get university's interests</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the data's there,</v>

183
00:09:47.631 --> 00:09:52.631
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's very difficult to get a big </v>

184
00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:52.631
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy to move.</v>

185
00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:54.950
<v Speaker 1>A big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big is a mobile.</v>

186
00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.760
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not sure if there's anything they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can really do about it that it's </v>

187
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.291
<v Speaker 1>certainly possible that the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to do about it or making </v>

188
00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:05.291
<v Speaker 1>it worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:07.020
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that you learn if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a good social scientists,</v>

190
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:12.040
<v Speaker 1>just like there was evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if this is still the </v>

191
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.040
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

192
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.360
<v Speaker 1>But there was good evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked into this about 15 years ago.</v>

193
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.900
<v Speaker 1>Say you want to prevent suicides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide hotline in your town and you </v>

194
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.990
<v Speaker 1>advertise it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

195
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Suicide rate goes up because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising suicide,</v>

196
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:30.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of lots of interventions are </v>

197
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.430
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

198
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.240
<v Speaker 1>really hard to make things better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

199
00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:35.570
<v Speaker 1>really easy to make them worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another problem.</v>

200
00:10:35.571 --> 00:10:37.940
<v Speaker 1>You get these big bureaucracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

201
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:42.941
<v Speaker 1>and there hypothetically motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive intentions and I would say </v>

202
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it takes an awful lot of work to</v>

203
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:46.580
<v Speaker 1>help someone straightened out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke,</v>

204
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.700
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're in real trouble </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they put in place these structures </v>

205
00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 1>that are designed to help but they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever evaluate them and they could easily</v>

206
00:10:57.211 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 1>be making it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

207
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.870
<v Speaker 1>so I don't have a straightforward answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that question.</v>

208
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that.</v>

209
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only answer I have.</v>

210
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

211
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

212
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the end of the show.</v>

213
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 2>If you're in the first two rows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can stick around and get some </v>

214
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

215
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:21.670
<v Speaker 2>a drive safe and yeah.</v>

216
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
