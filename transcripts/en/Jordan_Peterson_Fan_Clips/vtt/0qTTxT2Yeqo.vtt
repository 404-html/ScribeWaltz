1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.860
<v Speaker 1>So during that period of time I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed is a good word</v>

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 2>with</v>

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.310
<v Speaker 1>a question in the question was why would</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings produced two camps</v>

4
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 2>and then</v>

5
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>produce a massive arsenal of hydrogen </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs and I don't know what you know </v>

6
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.081
<v Speaker 1>about hydrogen bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have atom bombs for triggers </v>

7
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where thinking about,</v>

8
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>because an atom bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

10
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.080
<v Speaker 1>that's something but a hydrogen bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the son that's really something.</v>

11
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

12
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:47.830
<v Speaker 1>there's 20 there at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

13
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>at the peak of the Cold War and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is still true to some degree.</v>

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>There were literally tens of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these weapons aimed at the Soviet </v>

15
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Union then at the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was enough to pretty much put </v>

16
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>an end to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a dangerous game man,</v>

17
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only because of intent but also </v>

18
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>because of the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidental.</v>

19
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Just an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a mistake or just someone who's a </v>

21
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>little crazier than you might want them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

22
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

23
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>well no one would want to bring about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the destruction of the world.</v>

24
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:28.391
<v Speaker 1>But that just means you don't know very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much about stellan because of all the </v>

25
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>people who lived in the 20th century who</v>
<v Speaker 1>had power,</v>

26
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Stalin was the most motivated to bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything to an end.</v>

27
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.830
<v Speaker 1>There's some evidence that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered by Khrushchev and his crew and </v>

28
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Khrushchev was the next leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he wasn't murdered,</v>

29
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>he was at least not provided with </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical attention when he was dying.</v>

30
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.470
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>there is reasonable evidence that he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>gearing up to invade western Europe and </v>

32
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really care how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction would go along with that.</v>

33
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:09.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd already killed tens of millions of </v>

34
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:09.521
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a lot of practice.</v>

35
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:11.900
<v Speaker 1>He was good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't really bother him.</v>

36
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell?</v>

37
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can it be that we're doing this?</v>

38
00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:27.931
<v Speaker 1>It's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I started to think about belief </v>

39
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.200
<v Speaker 1>because you could say that each camp had</v>
<v Speaker 1>its own belief system.</v>

41
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>The one in the West was derived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd had a very lengthy history derived</v>

42
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>from the Greeks and the Romans and Jews </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Christians.</v>

43
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:46.931
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and from various schools of philosophy </v>

44
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>and from the enlightenment and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

45
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:52.391
<v Speaker 1>and then the Soviet Union was basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on irrational philosophy </v>

46
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.950
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that opposed the axioms that the West </v>

47
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.871
<v Speaker 1>had evolved and each group organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>their societies around that.</v>

48
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.440
<v Speaker 1>And No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took political science for quite a </v>

49
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.440
<v Speaker 1>long time</v>

50
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.150
<v Speaker 1>and the political scientists and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists,</v>

51
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.320
<v Speaker 1>they basically thought that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>competed over resources.</v>

52
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't a very good answer as </v>

53
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.831
<v Speaker 1>far as I was concerned because it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious to me why people valued the </v>

54
00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:26.880
<v Speaker 1>resources they valued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was the economist just assume that</v>

55
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.360
<v Speaker 1>there's resources that you value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

56
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.410
<v Speaker 1>people can value a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

57
00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.510
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly fixed.</v>

58
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean you tend to value food very </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly if you're hungry obviously,</v>

59
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:39.240
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things that we value and</v>

60
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:42.990
<v Speaker 1>that we want that seem somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary,</v>

61
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.050
<v Speaker 1>somewhat like a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got more interested in why people </v>

62
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.011
<v Speaker 1>valued things and what it meant to value</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and then what it meant to </v>

63
00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:56.361
<v Speaker 1>believe something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then how it could be that someone </v>

64
00:03:57.031 --> 00:04:02.031
<v Speaker 1>could believe something so deeply that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would risk their own death to </v>

65
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.640
<v Speaker 1>protect it or at least risk the death of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and maybe on a massive </v>

66
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:09.270
<v Speaker 1>scale like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

67
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:11.970
<v Speaker 1>people are committed to their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their system.</v>

68
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system of belief is not just a system </v>

69
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.411
<v Speaker 1>of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that I came to </v>

70
00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:23.361
<v Speaker 1>understand is that it's not appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make this to psychological people,</v>

71
00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:26.310
<v Speaker 1>defend their belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not exactly right.</v>

72
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:28.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a shared belief system.</v>

73
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sufficiently shared so that here we</v>

74
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:34.410
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know each other.</v>

75
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.000
<v Speaker 1>We're a bunch of primates.</v>

76
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>We're in this room and it's peaceful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's scared.</v>

77
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty amazing.</v>

78
00:04:42.531 --> 00:04:45.230
<v Speaker 1>And that means that we're all acting out</v>
<v Speaker 1>our roles.</v>

79
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>So we're acting out of roles and we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an expectation with regards to those </v>

80
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.940
<v Speaker 1>roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those two things match.</v>

81
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's the important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk about that a lot.</v>

82
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.920
<v Speaker 1>It isn't the belief system or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity of the belief system even.</v>

83
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.620
<v Speaker 1>It's the match between the belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

84
00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:06.590
<v Speaker 1>And the actions of the other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the belief system,</v>

85
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>what you want to maintain is that match.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to act out your beliefs in the </v>

86
00:05:11.871 --> 00:05:14.870
<v Speaker 1>world and you want what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

87
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get what you want and you validate </v>

88
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>your belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great,</v>

89
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>perfect security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of that is if we're </v>

90
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.680
<v Speaker 1>interacting even right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole set of expectations that</v>

91
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:30.830
<v Speaker 1>are governing what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want me to take your your</v>

92
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 1>little tablet there and smash it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be shocking,</v>

93
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would know what the hell to do,</v>

94
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be somewhere different if I did </v>

95
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.600
<v Speaker 1>that and you wouldn't know where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

96
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing to know because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a fundamental difference.</v>

97
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a fundamental difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing where you are and not knowing </v>

98
00:05:52.821 --> 00:05:57.821
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in some sense the </v>

99
00:05:57.821 --> 00:06:01.390
<v Speaker 1>fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it as the </v>

100
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.390
<v Speaker 1>distinction between explored an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory,</v>

101
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>but you have to.</v>

102
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever taken a cat </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a new house.</v>

103
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Cats hate that and because in our old </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and maybe in their old </v>

104
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.330
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they slunk around,</v>

105
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the edges,</v>

106
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.670
<v Speaker 1>checking everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start out freight,</v>

107
00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:26.590
<v Speaker 1>afraid it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check everything out.</v>

108
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>They know where to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know where to,</v>

109
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.020
<v Speaker 1>they knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew,</v>

110
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.170
<v Speaker 1>they know what's safe and they know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they go somewhere and nothing </v>

111
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.801
<v Speaker 1>happens and so then the assuming that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's safe and they slowly build up a </v>

112
00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:39.370
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood that they're comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

113
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
<v Speaker 1>My Dad used to take the dog for a walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the cat got lonesome and so it </v>

114
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.020
<v Speaker 1>started to follow him and first of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just go along the buildings,</v>

115
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:51.310
<v Speaker 1>the houses on their route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no hiding really from predators.</v>

116
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And after a while it got kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with that and then it would </v>

117
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.080
<v Speaker 1>follow right behind the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it had a border.</v>

118
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.140
<v Speaker 1>And if my dad took the dog over one </v>
<v Speaker 1>street too many for the cat,</v>

119
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.810
<v Speaker 1>the cat would just sit on the corner </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

120
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.970
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cry like a cap.</v>

121
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Cries was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it for me,</v>

122
00:07:12.671 --> 00:07:17.671
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going any farther out into the </v>

123
00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:20.311
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the distinction between the </v>

124
00:07:20.311 --> 00:07:25.141
<v Speaker 1>territory that you have mastered and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory that you haven't mastered is a</v>

125
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:31.231
<v Speaker 1>fundamental distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the distinction between home and </v>

126
00:07:31.231 --> 00:07:35.460
<v Speaker 1>the strange land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about familiar territory </v>

127
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.870
<v Speaker 1>for people is that most of the familiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory that we inhabit is other </v>

128
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.951
<v Speaker 1>people because we're so social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't really think it's a weird </v>

129
00:07:43.951 --> 00:07:48.361
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly geographical objective </v>

130
00:07:48.361 --> 00:07:52.531
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's territory with a dominance </v>

131
00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:55.921
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in it and the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy has a predictable structure </v>

132
00:07:55.921 --> 00:07:57.070
<v Speaker 1>and you know where you fit in it most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

133
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And so that when you act out in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory surrounded by your people,</v>

134
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:06.090
<v Speaker 1>then often you get what you want and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so thrilled about that because </v>

135
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.040
<v Speaker 1>you just don't want someone acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically around you.</v>

136
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Like and you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he walked down bloor and there's </v>

137
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 1>people there that should really be </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutionalized,</v>

138
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>but we institutionalize them all so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be free and free to be,</v>

139
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.170
<v Speaker 1>suffering and malfunctioning out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

141
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.300
<v Speaker 1>That's what the freedom ended up being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

142
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you'll walk by someone like that who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring away to the voices in his </v>

143
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:35.320
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't you know,</v>

144
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:35.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe</v>

145
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.970
<v Speaker 1>striking out against whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's plaguing him and you will make </v>

146
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 1>eye contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might even go across the street.</v>

147
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>You're certainly going to give him a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide berth.</v>

148
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:53.651
<v Speaker 1>You're going to keep a distance between </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and you and you're going to hope </v>

149
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:58.661
<v Speaker 1>that you don't attract his attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's not in the dominance </v>

150
00:08:58.661 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and you don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell he might do.</v>

151
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's unexplored territory too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it,</v>

152
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:10.821
<v Speaker 1>like we inhabit time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just space and not just time.</v>

153
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>We inhabit time and space and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>territories are spacial.</v>

154
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:20.721
<v Speaker 1>Temporal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're here now and this is safe now and </v>

155
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 1>it saved partly because of the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and it's working,</v>

156
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's also safe because none of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are manifesting peculiar behavior.</v>

157
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 1>But if you started to manifest peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

158
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.540
<v Speaker 1>if you stood up and started muttering or</v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling or maybe attacking someone next </v>

159
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:43.551
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the rest of you would freeze first </v>

160
00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>because then all of a sudden this would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be unexplored territory,</v>

161
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.990
<v Speaker 1>the match between what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a peaceful lecture that you </v>

162
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.621
<v Speaker 1>hope has some content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the match between what you want and </v>

163
00:09:55.091 --> 00:09:59.380
<v Speaker 1>what's happening has vanished and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not.</v>

164
00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what do you do when you </v>

165
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.281
<v Speaker 1>don't know where you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when you don't know what </v>

166
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:08.281
<v Speaker 1>to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

167
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:09.520
<v Speaker 1>if you're a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just crash,</v>

168
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

169
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 1>you know what good is that to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to die.</v>

170
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:20.090
<v Speaker 1>That isn't helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You freeze first and then maybe you </v>

171
00:10:21.711 --> 00:10:24.050
<v Speaker 1>cautiously cautiously attend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you don't.</v>

172
00:10:24.051 --> 00:10:29.051
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just keep your damn eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>averted and you sit there and you hope </v>

173
00:10:29.051 --> 00:10:30.800
<v Speaker 1>that no one notices you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a Predator prey response,</v>

174
00:10:30.801 --> 00:10:35.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a rabbit frozen when it </v>

175
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.660
<v Speaker 1>thinks a fox is looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were prey animals for a long </v>

176
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:37.660
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
