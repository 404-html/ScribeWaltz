1
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a truism and probably an </v>
<v Speaker 1>oversimplified one that since the dawn </v>

3
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:13.951
<v Speaker 1>of the scientific revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wedge has been driven through the </v>

4
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:21.531
<v Speaker 1>heart of our society such that the moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that we use to Unitus,</v>

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>so those would be religious systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally have been subject to an </v>

6
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 1>intense critique from the scientists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty effective critique even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

8
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>even if you've maintained a traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>

9
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>

10
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

11
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>the scientific onslaught is no joke and</v>

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem as far as I can tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>because and the problem is that you're </v>

13
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>still left with the problem of how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should act.</v>

14
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.870
<v Speaker 1>And Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the philosopher Nietzsche,</v>

15
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>he would say that we're running on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fumes of Christianity in the West </v>

16
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>because over it's thousand years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>domination to let's say,</v>

17
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:13.491
<v Speaker 1>1500 years of absolute domination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It produced a consensus of morality that</v>

18
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:20.031
<v Speaker 1>was predicated on metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions and that organized </v>

19
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:23.481
<v Speaker 1>societies and those societies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on certain beliefs like the </v>

20
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:29.001
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really I would say that something </v>

21
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>divined inhabits each individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of presumption that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>embedded in law.</v>

23
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of the idea that underlies the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of natural,</v>

24
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

25
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>There's something about you that's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable that even the law has to bow to</v>

26
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're reprehensible,</v>

27
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 1>even if you're convicted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible now that's man,</v>

28
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>the idea that people came up with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

29
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a bloody miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because generally speaking,</v>

30
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>your proclivity is if someone's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>even accused of doing something,</v>

31
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 1>that general human proclivity is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>even if someone's just being accused of </v>

32
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>doing something terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's enough so that you can stone them</v>

33
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 1>to death or do whatever you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with them.</v>

34
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Presumption of innocence before guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good God,</v>

35
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>of all the things that aren't automatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got to top the list.</v>

36
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:14.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

37
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable that that occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's interesting to me because it </v>

38
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>seems to me that</v>

39
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.490
<v Speaker 1>that presupposition that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something valuable transcendent about </v>

40
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.971
<v Speaker 1>each individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call that a scientific </v>

41
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:35.041
<v Speaker 1>presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be a highly functional </v>

42
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:35.041
<v Speaker 1>presupposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I think in that it isn't unreasonable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that societies that have</v>

44
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>value the individual and made the law </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to the individual even with </v>

45
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>regards to voting because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what voting does,</v>

46
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>put sovereignty in the hands of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

47
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Those societies actually seemed to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now whether they'll work for the next </v>

48
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell knows?</v>

49
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:06.391
<v Speaker 1>I don't know them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've worked pretty well for the </v>

50
00:03:06.391 --> 00:03:08.251
<v Speaker 1>last 500 years let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've got it pretty good right now </v>

51
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect most of you are rather pleased</v>

52
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.030
<v Speaker 1>that the law recognizes your value as </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals and you take that for </v>

53
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>You think you have rights and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rights that you have.</v>

55
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:27.241
<v Speaker 1>Natural rights are a logical consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your transcendent value and that's </v>

56
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:35.521
<v Speaker 1>nested in this niche niches observation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nested in a set of metaphysical </v>

57
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his idea was that if you wipe out,</v>

58
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:42.661
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wipe out the metaphysical beliefs </v>

59
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:45.540
<v Speaker 1>eventually wipe out the whole system </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you've knocked out the </v>

60
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.271
<v Speaker 1>cornerstone and it might take a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time for the thing to shake and fall.</v>

61
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:53.851
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will now whether he was right or </v>

62
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say.</v>

63
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 1>It looks to me like what's happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>since Nietzsche announced the death of </v>

64
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.181
<v Speaker 1>God and say the late 18 hundreds is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>western society is oscillated between </v>

65
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>extremes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremes on the right Germany,</v>

66
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>extremes on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

67
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the democracies,</v>

68
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.780
<v Speaker 1>at least the other democracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracies managing to stay the course </v>

69
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>somewhere down the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

70
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's not obvious to me that that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be maintained without the underlying </v>

71
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:38.731
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem because whatever </v>

72
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>you might say about the underlying </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics,</v>

73
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not true the way science is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that could be okay because there </v>

74
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>might be more than one form of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

75
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I think there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's pragmatic truth and I </v>

76
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 1>think pragmatic truth is actually deeper</v>
<v Speaker 1>than scientific truth.</v>

77
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.450
<v Speaker 1>And pragmatic truth is the truth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>enable you to act in a manner that best.</v>

78
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It improves the probability roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of your existence and your </v>

79
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:14.540
<v Speaker 1>reproduction maximally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a Darwinian idea.</v>

80
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Darwinian theory just kind of puts it in</v>

81
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>opposition to scientific materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

82
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:26.581
<v Speaker 1>is that the Darwinian theory is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have privileged knowledge of the </v>

83
00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:31.550
<v Speaker 1>world and you can actually tell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you die,</v>

84
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you knew enough about the world,</v>

85
00:05:33.711 --> 00:05:38.711
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't die and you do die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're an embodied theory of </v>

86
00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:42.221
<v Speaker 1>sorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that theory is good enough to get </v>

87
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:44.561
<v Speaker 1>you along about 80 years and produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>some reasonable probability that you'll </v>

88
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.050
<v Speaker 1>have children and that they all survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>

89
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you've managed after 3 </v>

90
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>billion years of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good enough,</v>

91
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a good enough way of acting and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know a better way of acting and </v>

92
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.070
<v Speaker 1>our world conceptions are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>nested inside the Darwinian system and </v>

93
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.510
<v Speaker 1>they might be predicated on pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>truths rather than objective truths.</v>

94
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Pragmatic truths are truths that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional utility and we're alive.</v>

95
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>We care about being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can to use our theories as tools.</v>

96
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that our theories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>tools and that they're tools to help us </v>

97
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.870
<v Speaker 1>stay alive.</v>

98
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Now I was reading a bit about Camille </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paglia the other day and uh,</v>

99
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed some similarities between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a famous gadfly,</v>

100
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I would say a feminists have classic </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern feminists,</v>

101
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:52.480
<v Speaker 1>although she would regard yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist,</v>

102
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.170
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to watch someone who's </v>

103
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.590
<v Speaker 1>verbally who has verbal mastery beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

104
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could watch Camille Paglia.</v>

105
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:05.080
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

106
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.110
<v Speaker 1>she seems a little manic to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can wrap off and argument at a rate </v>

107
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.290
<v Speaker 1>that's just mind boggling and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very coherent and she tends to shred her</v>

108
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:16.630
<v Speaker 1>opponents and arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so brilliant.</v>

109
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

110
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.510
<v Speaker 1>she said something interesting and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been influenced by some of the same </v>

111
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.021
<v Speaker 1>people that I've been influenced by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She liked this book by Eric Norman </v>

112
00:07:28.021 --> 00:07:29.470
<v Speaker 1>called the origins and history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

113
00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:33.100
<v Speaker 1>which I would recommend if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in young Ian theory,</v>

114
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good introduction to union theory</v>

115
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's about the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and it's predicated like </v>

116
00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 1>young's work and Joseph Campbell's work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Murcia Elliot is work,</v>

117
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.700
<v Speaker 1>all of which has been criticized or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored by the postmodernist,</v>

118
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.820
<v Speaker 1>predicated on id on the idea that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have a central narrative</v>

119
00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 2>and that</v>

120
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.810
<v Speaker 1>that central narrative is</v>

121
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.160
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

122
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.890
<v Speaker 1>dramatic expression of the necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>human system of values and that that's </v>

123
00:08:14.371 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>built into us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

124
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.060
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of our nature.</v>

125
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.120
<v Speaker 1>We have a nature as human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not infinitely malleable white </v>

126
00:08:23.341 --> 00:08:28.341
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a postmodernist claim and a </v>

127
00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:33.591
<v Speaker 1>dangerous one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous if we have a nature.</v>

128
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

129
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Paglia has this idea</v>

130
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

131
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you come to university </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you studied the humanities or the </v>

132
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.821
<v Speaker 1>proper reason if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not to engage in premature and </v>

133
00:08:51.571 --> 00:08:55.950
<v Speaker 1>destructive criticism of something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even yet understand,</v>

134
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 1>but to learn as much as you can about</v>

135
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:07.540
<v Speaker 1>art and literature and poetry and drama </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fiction and religious thinking and </v>

136
00:09:11.721 --> 00:09:14.140
<v Speaker 1>this is all a kind of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about it as a.</v>

137
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.180
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is all that?</v>

138
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's art culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Music belongs in that category and like </v>

139
00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:24.260
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

140
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:29.320
<v Speaker 1>what about music?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone loves it or almost </v>

141
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:29.540
<v Speaker 1>every one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mystery.</v>

142
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.000
<v Speaker 1>You listened to music and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>

143
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean music gets people through some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty dark times.</v>

144
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Why it's not obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

145
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.900
<v Speaker 1>You know when in most cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music plays a very central role in </v>

146
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.871
<v Speaker 1>identity formation and you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll probably find as you age </v>

147
00:09:46.871 --> 00:09:50.741
<v Speaker 1>that your favorite music will be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>music that you listened to between the </v>

148
00:09:50.741 --> 00:09:54.851
<v Speaker 1>ages of 16 and 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like an imprint on you and </v>

149
00:09:54.851 --> 00:09:58.120
<v Speaker 1>it defines a maybe that defines a </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation and maybe you know,</v>

150
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:03.130
<v Speaker 1>in our tribal past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is highly likely when you were </v>

151
00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:08.251
<v Speaker 1>being inculcated into the tribal culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was inculcated with dance and with </v>

152
00:10:10.481 --> 00:10:13.030
<v Speaker 1>masks and with music all at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

153
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 1>So you're invited to participate in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>drama and to take your place in this </v>

154
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 1>drama and to think of that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the objective world is</v>

155
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.260
<v Speaker 1>just not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what it is.</v>

156
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.960
<v Speaker 1>It's an invitation to a drama.</v>

157
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the question might be,</v>

158
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.400
<v Speaker 1>well is the drama reel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer to that is depends on </v>

159
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:39.711
<v Speaker 1>what you mean by real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that great dramas are more real </v>

160
00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 1>than real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're hyper real there.</v>

161
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 1>They're hyper real because they provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>guidelines about how to act that are </v>

162
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.010
<v Speaker 1>abstract and even perhaps generic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but applicable across an extraordinary </v>

163
00:10:56.231 --> 00:10:58.000
<v Speaker 1>broad range of situations.</v>
