1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.500
<v Speaker 1>All then we have jimminy cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's south southern US slang for Jesus</v>

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Christ by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the initial overlap isn't a fluke.</v>

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the animators thought that was </v>

4
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.560
<v Speaker 1>funny and of course it is funny and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lion king,</v>

6
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>you know that that at bat boone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the shaman basically?</v>

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with,</v>

8
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>he was kind of just a comic relief </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

9
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>like a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things young mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the fool,</v>

11
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>the fool tends to turn into the savior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>

12
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>it's an archetypal reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bugs bunny is sort of like that,</v>

13
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a trickster.</v>

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And as the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the movie developed,</v>

15
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>the character of the fool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baboons took on the full fledged,</v>

16
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shaman,</v>

17
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>priest element and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

18
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Jimminy cricket,</v>

19
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>he's this little cricket and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he turns out to be the conscience,</v>

20
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty damn weird.</v>

21
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like a bug is your conscience and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bug is jc and it's like that's a very </v>

22
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>strange juxtaposition of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>

23
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>insect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>savior.</v>

24
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

25
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>what's up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

26
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what bugs you,</v>

27
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>that's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while your conscious conscience </v>

28
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>certainly bugs you and you should pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>

29
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just little niggling annoying thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't quite.</v>

30
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>You can override it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's this swallowed.</v>

32
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he talks to Pinocchio later,</v>

33
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>he says it's that still small voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>and I've asked people before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in my personality class,</v>

35
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:33.010
<v Speaker 1>like [inaudible] conscience is a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

36
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like if I said to you,</v>

37
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>if you're about to do something that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know you shouldn't do,</v>

38
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>do you have a voice in your head that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells you that you shouldn't do it?</v>

39
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>So how many people have had that </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience?</v>

40
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

41
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

42
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>so other people have a feeling instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a voice.</v>

43
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>And so is there anybody here who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to admit it?</v>

44
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Who has neither the feeling nor the </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice?</v>

45
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

46
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very understudied phenomena in </v>

47
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This conscience.</v>

48
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.671
<v Speaker 1>I mean people can be conscientious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe those are people who listen to </v>

49
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:08.400
<v Speaker 1>their conscience more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

50
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's ever investigated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you do have this </v>

51
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>little voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is inside your head,</v>

52
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is up with that?</v>

53
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't tell you what you want to</v>

54
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least as far as I can tell.</v>

55
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>that's the internal representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>society operating within you.</v>

57
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a Freudian view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Super Ego.</v>

58
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And certainly there's something to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it's necessary to </v>

59
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>presume that that's all there is to it.</v>

60
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>And even if it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still wouldn't have the voice.</v>

61
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:42.351
<v Speaker 1>It's if you didn't have the biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential to have that voice embedded </v>

62
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:46.911
<v Speaker 1>itself in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if it is socio culturally </v>

63
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it is in part,</v>

64
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like your language associate </v>

65
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>culturally constructed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason you can speak is because </v>

66
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>human beings can speak and if you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>

67
00:02:55.321 --> 00:03:00.321
<v Speaker 1>that's because human beings have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience and the contents of that </v>

68
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>might differ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that it exists,</v>

69
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>what seems to be to be universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

70
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>so well that's the conscience and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimminy cricket.</v>

71
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>And then click the cricket opens this </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

72
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at the book and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

73
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>well what kind of book is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

74
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>it's got a spotlight on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's being highlighted.</v>

75
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>This is an important book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what kind of book is it?</v>

76
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's leather bound.</v>

77
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>It has a lock on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not some cheap book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like a,</v>

79
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.550
<v Speaker 1>you might think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like something from an old </v>

80
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.550
<v Speaker 1>library or maybe it looks biblical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

81
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.261
<v Speaker 1>It's a major league book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this bug is the introduction to the </v>

82
00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:40.381
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it does that mean your conscience is </v>

83
00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>the introduction to the book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe that is what it means.</v>

84
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:46.651
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly what's being played out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movie while then the cricket </v>

85
00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>opens the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then what do you see?</v>

86
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that look like?</v>

87
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.480
<v Speaker 1>What does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it remind you of?</v>

88
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the van Gogh painting.</v>

89
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a nativity scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

90
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.930
<v Speaker 1>it's the Christmas star and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because what's going to happen?</v>

91
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero is going to be born.</v>

92
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a star signifies that,</v>

93
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.540
<v Speaker 1>why does this star signify the birth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an infant,</v>

94
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.860
<v Speaker 1>let's say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:21.420
<v Speaker 1>because there's something miraculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the birth of an infant and,</v>

96
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.560
<v Speaker 1>and why would the infant be a savior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the Christian notion say,</v>

97
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what the infant is </v>

98
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.900
<v Speaker 1>potentially every infant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how you should act about </v>

99
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.450
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

100
00:04:33.451 --> 00:04:36.150
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about having little kids,</v>

101
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.600
<v Speaker 1>and I loved having little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you have this opportunity to </v>

102
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.640
<v Speaker 1>have this pristine relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like,</v>

103
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.890
<v Speaker 1>like a relationship you've never had </v>
<v Speaker 1>with anyone because the kid really is </v>

104
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.920
<v Speaker 1>just there to love you.</v>

105
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.400
<v Speaker 1>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't screw it up,</v>

106
00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:53.550
<v Speaker 1>you've got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can keep that going.</v>

107
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.610
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can try to keep that </v>

108
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>relationship like pristine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so fun.</v>

109
00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:00.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so fun to try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

110
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.110
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

111
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:08.070
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing thing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids get a bad rap in our society,</v>

112
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:13.071
<v Speaker 1>but it's an amazing thing to helped </v>
<v Speaker 1>little kids and they are remarkable and </v>

113
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>they give you back far more than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>require from you and partly because they</v>

114
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:23.241
<v Speaker 1>treat you like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're valuable beyond belief.</v>

115
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what the kid thinks about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

116
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.310
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

117
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:32.190
<v Speaker 1>it's something divine is going to happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so okay,</v>

118
00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:33.090
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.480
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:41.481
<v Speaker 1>there's The star signifying that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's associated in some way with </v>

121
00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 1>this star that you're supposed to wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon.</v>

122
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of odd.</v>

123
00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:48.921
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this relationship that's </v>

124
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:51.501
<v Speaker 1>implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that star that signifies the birth of </v>

125
00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:51.501
<v Speaker 1>the hero is the same star that you wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon.</v>

126
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

127
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.980
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the star that you're wishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon is the wish that the hero will be </v>

128
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>born in your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

129
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:01.770
<v Speaker 1>You're aiming at the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

130
00:06:01.771 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>It's the ideal you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that would be.</v>

131
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can certainly figure out what it </v>

132
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.761
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you start as far as I can </v>

133
00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:12.761
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:16.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you shouldn't be doing and you </v>

135
00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>could at least stop doing those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then see what happens,</v>

136
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you ask yourself,</v>

137
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a meditative exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 1>and you do this with the autobiography </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some degree.</v>

139
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

140
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 1>sit down for 10 minutes and have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little dialogue with yourself.</v>

141
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you actually wanted to know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>

142
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

143
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm probably doing something stupid</v>

144
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>that if I quit doing my life would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

145
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 1>that I could quit doing that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>quit doing.</v>

146
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's not a very big thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not very disciplined,</v>

147
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 1>but maybe there's something to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself that question,</v>

148
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:50.111
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have an answer and no time flat </v>

149
00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:50.111
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

150
00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:50.111
<v Speaker 1>I should start doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

151
00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:50.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I could.</v>

152
00:06:50.741 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 1>I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

154
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I did,</v>

155
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I know my life would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can figure that out </v>

156
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 1>immediately and if you do that 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

157
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>well you'll be in way better shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't know what to do,</v>

158
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:10.751
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could at least figure out what you </v>

159
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:10.751
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do that's just moronically you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

160
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:15.251
<v Speaker 1>pathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can be sure you're doing like a </v>

161
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:15.251
<v Speaker 1>dozen of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least you know,</v>

162
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:19.280
<v Speaker 1>procrastinating or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know everyone.</v>

163
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:21.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what the conscience tells you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ask,</v>

164
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.350
<v Speaker 1>they'll just tell you why you're stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and insufficient.</v>

165
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.110
<v Speaker 1>And so who wants to hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>

166
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could do something about it.</v>

167
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cricut comes into the village </v>

168
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.031
<v Speaker 1>there and he sees this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this like little house and there's a </v>

169
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:40.240
<v Speaker 1>little fire in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's Kinda got a welcoming place.</v>

170
00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:42.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a light in the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This house just like the star.</v>

171
00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:46.270
<v Speaker 1>And so he hops towards it and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends up inside it and you know,</v>

172
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:49.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a nice fire and you get to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the inside and the insights.</v>

173
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.860
<v Speaker 1>It's cozy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.930
<v Speaker 1>it's welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you look around,</v>

175
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:55.240
<v Speaker 1>you see that everything's kind of in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

176
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not hyper organized or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

177
00:07:57.641 --> 00:08:01.120
<v Speaker 1>It's friendly and welcoming and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of wood and there's a nice</v>

178
00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:04.810
<v Speaker 1>fire and then there's toys everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're well constructed.</v>

179
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:07.060
<v Speaker 1>So you know that whoever lives there </v>
<v Speaker 1>likes children.</v>

180
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 1>And so if someone likes children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

181
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 1>if someone doesn't like children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you should run away from them </v>

182
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

183
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.610
<v Speaker 1>But if they liked children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then that's a good sign that you </v>

184
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:17.610
<v Speaker 1>know Jesus there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least human.</v>

185
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

186
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.870
<v Speaker 1>And then these things are all high </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>

187
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:25.180
<v Speaker 1>They're made very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

188
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.260
<v Speaker 1>and he's looking around to see all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and there's,</v>

189
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 1>there's toys and there's clocks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all handmade.</v>

190
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.400
<v Speaker 1>And so he sort of infers that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a woodcarver,</v>

191
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:35.390
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who lives there and a woodcarver.</v>

192
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can build things.</v>

193
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:40.270
<v Speaker 1>And if you build things that work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are beautiful,</v>

194
00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:41.620
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a kind of truth,</v>

195
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:46.621
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's built right into the </v>

196
00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:46.621
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what quality is.</v>

197
00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Quality is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

198
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.920
<v Speaker 1>the building into an object of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing works.</v>

199
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:55.921
<v Speaker 1>It does what it's supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has integrity and so you see that </v>

200
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:57.200
<v Speaker 1>everywhere inherent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're getting a sense of the,</v>

201
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:57.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

202
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.190
<v Speaker 1>the film makers are setting the stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so while,</v>

203
00:09:01.191 --> 00:09:06.191
<v Speaker 1>so they set the stage by showing you the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and the cricket tells you what he </v>

204
00:09:06.191 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 1>sees and he's pretty happy to be there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

205
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 1>And this is also someone who's concerned</v>
<v Speaker 1>about time,</v>

206
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there was a lot of clocks,</v>

207
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of clocks and so time </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be an important sub element</v>

208
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:20.301
<v Speaker 1>of this story and then he sees the </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet marionette and so what's a marion</v>

209
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:21.930
<v Speaker 1>out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

210
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 1>a Marionette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he'd be sitting on the shelf.</v>

211
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 1>A marionette is something that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>animated because it can move.</v>

212
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.040
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really have a soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sort of acts like it has a soul.</v>

213
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.050
<v Speaker 1>It in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

214
00:09:33.051 --> 00:09:34.960
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sense of anima and soul.</v>

215
00:09:34.961 --> 00:09:39.961
<v Speaker 1>It animated and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a Marionette is something that is </v>

216
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 1>being manipulated by something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes,</v>

217
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have its own volition.</v>

218
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:49.130
<v Speaker 1>It's dependent on the will have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something behind the scenes and so </v>

219
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.601
<v Speaker 1>there's a strong implication that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever this thing is is half formed </v>

220
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.850
<v Speaker 1>and that it's being manipulated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>unseen forces behind unseen forces </v>

221
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 1>behind the facade.</v>

222
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a freudian idea.</v>

223
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 1>That's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all of you.</v>

224
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:11.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're polled hither and fro by </v>

225
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:15.320
<v Speaker 1>unconscious forces and some of those are</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and some of them are </v>

226
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:15.320
<v Speaker 1>cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.761
<v Speaker 1>and you think about people who are swept</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in great ideological movements like </v>

228
00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:22.890
<v Speaker 1>the Communists or the fascist is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people are marrying nets.</v>

229
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all say the same thing.</v>

230
00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:31.281
<v Speaker 1>They almost the same words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all act the same way and some </v>

231
00:10:31.281 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 1>things behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is what?</v>

232
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the question and that's partly </v>

233
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:38.520
<v Speaker 1>what this movie tries to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see this Marionette,</v>

234
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:43.550
<v Speaker 1>he's at half formed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't headed puppet and he has a </v>

235
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 1>little bit of potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Speaker 1>and the cricket goes up and interacts </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and sees that he's made out of</v>

237
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:53.001
<v Speaker 1>pretty good wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes a little joke about having a </v>

238
00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>wooden head and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of obvious what that means.</v>

239
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:58.370
<v Speaker 1>And you noticed the cricket is dressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tramp and,</v>

240
00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:03.490
<v Speaker 1>and when you first saw him he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was dressed like a 19 twenties </v>

241
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:03.490
<v Speaker 1>millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

242
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:08.180
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here he's a tramp and this is so </v>

243
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:08.180
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

244
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.030
<v Speaker 1>so this bug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a messiah,</v>

245
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:14.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the introduction to the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the conscience is also a tramp </v>

246
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>with no home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what does that mean?</v>

247
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>And it took me a long time to sort that </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and it's like he's been everywhere.</v>

248
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.020
<v Speaker 1>This tramp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been everywhere and,</v>

249
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.180
<v Speaker 1>and he knows he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's traveled the world and anybody who </v>

250
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.180
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have a home.</v>

251
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't made a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything real yet.</v>

252
00:11:33.451 --> 00:11:35.220
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of a potential.</v>

253
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.520
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting about this movie </v>

254
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.071
<v Speaker 1>because if you think about the cricket </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a fragment of the of the hero and say</v>

255
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:46.350
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reflection of the of the savior,</v>

256
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:49.140
<v Speaker 1>which is his relationship with jc of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

257
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:54.141
<v Speaker 1>and the person who introduces the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the story gets strange because if </v>

258
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it was merely a representation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect person,</v>

259
00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:02.881
<v Speaker 1>the archetype of the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the conscience would know </v>

260
00:12:02.881 --> 00:12:02.881
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

261
00:12:02.881 --> 00:12:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And it would just tell the puppet what </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do and that would be the end of it.</v>

262
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

263
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:12.151
<v Speaker 1>that's adult story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like perfect conscience comes </v>

264
00:12:12.151 --> 00:12:12.151
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puppet does everything.</v>

265
00:12:12.151 --> 00:12:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It says being goal perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what happens.</v>

266
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:20.731
<v Speaker 1>There's this weird idea that this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got all these attributes needs a </v>

267
00:12:20.731 --> 00:12:25.141
<v Speaker 1>home and has to enter into a learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the thing that it's </v>

268
00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:29.890
<v Speaker 1>trying to transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so sophisticated because you know,</v>

269
00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 1>I could say you should do what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience tells you.</v>

270
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

271
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's not exactly how it works.</v>

272
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your conscience isn't omniscient </v>
<v Speaker 1>and omnipotent.</v>

273
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not gone right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a guide,</v>

274
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

275
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:49.020
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's maybe smarter than you sometimes </v>

276
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe because it's society in your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously it's smarter than you </v>

277
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.801
<v Speaker 1>sometimes because it tells you not to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you go do it and then you </v>

278
00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 1>get into trouble and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

279
00:12:55.931 --> 00:12:58.090
<v Speaker 1>if I would've just listened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't,</v>

280
00:12:58.091 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>and that's interesting too.</v>

281
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to,</v>

282
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 1>which is seems to be associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill.</v>

283
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.660
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if your conscience knows what </v>

284
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.850
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you just a deterministic </v>

285
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 1>puppet of your conscience Christ?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would work a lot better.</v>

286
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.880
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have to torture yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you wouldn't make any mistakes.</v>

287
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:18.670
<v Speaker 1>So why the separation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

288
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:23.671
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because of the conscience is </v>
<v Speaker 1>generic and so it has to be taught.</v>

289
00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:29.850
<v Speaker 1>It has to learn to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what you do is you have a </v>

290
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.921
<v Speaker 1>dialogue with your conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and then you </v>

291
00:13:31.921 --> 00:13:34.891
<v Speaker 1>expose yourself to more and more of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and you get wiser in your </v>

292
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:38.851
<v Speaker 1>conscience gets wiser and new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mature together and that's what </v>

293
00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:43.351
<v Speaker 1>happens in this story because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket starts out as a tramp that you </v>

294
00:13:43.351 --> 00:13:47.611
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is smarter than the puppet but not as </v>

295
00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:47.611
<v Speaker 1>smart as he thinks he is.</v>

296
00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he first starts to operate as a</v>

297
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's completely useless.</v>

298
00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:56.161
<v Speaker 1>Added.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He babbles off a lot of cliches about </v>

299
00:13:56.161 --> 00:13:58.591
<v Speaker 1>morality and then he's late the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>day for his job and he's just not very </v>

300
00:13:58.591 --> 00:14:02.881
<v Speaker 1>good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this weird idea that the </v>

301
00:14:02.881 --> 00:14:05.461
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of what puts you towards </v>

302
00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:08.311
<v Speaker 1>redemption is something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually have to interact with over the </v>

303
00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:10.570
<v Speaker 1>course of your life in order for it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop as you develop.</v>

304
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And so then I would also say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket represents,</v>

305
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 1>at least in part what you described as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the self,</v>

306
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:21.451
<v Speaker 1>which is like the potential fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed human being that sort of </v>

307
00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 1>exists within you as a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be.</v>

308
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 1>It has to be manifest in the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of your life.</v>

309
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:32.560
<v Speaker 1>And so the conscience has to learn how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to position itself here and now and it's</v>

310
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.170
<v Speaker 1>got generic advice and that's not good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

311
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.510
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why the cricket is looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a home.</v>

312
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.630
<v Speaker 1>And so he needs a home even though he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these other things we already said </v>

313
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.830
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to find a specific home before he</v>

314
00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:48.790
<v Speaker 1>can become who he could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

315
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:49.640
<v Speaker 1>so then Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

316
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.660
<v Speaker 1>shows up and he's a kindly old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much exactly what you'd </v>

317
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:54.660
<v Speaker 1>expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

318
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.931
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a careful craftsman and he likes </v>

319
00:14:58.931 --> 00:14:58.931
<v Speaker 1>kittens and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always a good thing.</v>

320
00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:05.250
<v Speaker 1>And he has some fish and I know he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He's good at making things and he's </v>

321
00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 1>got a sense of humor and he's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>playful.</v>

322
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:08.280
<v Speaker 1>And so he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

323
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 1>he's a good father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally.</v>

324
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.370
<v Speaker 1>He's the wise king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the positive archetype of the </v>

325
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:15.370
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he is.</v>

326
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 1>And so he's culture and its positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation.</v>

327
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 1>And he gives rise to this creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is his puppet,</v>

328
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.590
<v Speaker 1>which is what culture does because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a puppet of your culture,</v>

329
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:29.591
<v Speaker 1>you're a Marionette of your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe you could be more than </v>

330
00:15:29.591 --> 00:15:33.341
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the other thing that's </v>

331
00:15:33.341 --> 00:15:36.681
<v Speaker 1>strange about this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's strange about the mythological </v>

332
00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:38.640
<v Speaker 1>way of looking at the world because </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically deterministically,</v>

333
00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.340
<v Speaker 1>there's nature and there's culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are the deterministic product of the</v>

334
00:15:44.341 --> 00:15:47.940
<v Speaker 1>interaction between nature and culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing else to you than that.</v>

335
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 1>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the mythological world doesn't say </v>

336
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says something different.</v>

337
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.280
<v Speaker 1>It says that there's nature and culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's you and the you that's </v>

338
00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:04.041
<v Speaker 1>in there has choices and the destiny and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you actually affect the interplay </v>

339
00:16:04.321 --> 00:16:07.380
<v Speaker 1>of nature and culture in determining </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own character.</v>

340
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.500
<v Speaker 1>And it insists upon that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oldest stories we have,</v>

341
00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 1>there's always the hero and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal mother and the archetype.</v>

342
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always those three things.</v>

343
00:16:16.681 --> 00:16:20.760
<v Speaker 1>There's never just two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from a narrative perspective,</v>
