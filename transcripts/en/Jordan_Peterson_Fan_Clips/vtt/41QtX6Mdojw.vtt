1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.360
<v Speaker 1>One idea that's very common in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is that poverty is caused by </v>

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.811
<v Speaker 1>lack of money and that's a really stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea because money is very difficult to </v>

3
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:14.121
<v Speaker 1>handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had clients who were drug addicts and </v>

4
00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:18.170
<v Speaker 1>the worst possible thing that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to them was that they got some </v>

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just done.</v>

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:24.531
<v Speaker 1>they were hanging around with people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were little on the sociopathic side and </v>

8
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:29.571
<v Speaker 1>so especially if they weren't that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bright and couldn't defend themselves </v>

9
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.981
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as they got money while it was </v>

10
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>off to the bar with all the friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.580
<v Speaker 1>one guy I remember in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>every time he got as his disability </v>
<v Speaker 1>check,</v>

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>he was gone for five days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually fundament a ditch,</v>

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just go to the bar,</v>

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>spent every Saturday had on alcohol and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine and wake up in a ditch.</v>

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Three quarters dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>eventually completely dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And No.</v>

18
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Then he was ashamed and horrified and </v>
<v Speaker 1>repentant and he'd straightened himself </v>

19
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:11.841
<v Speaker 1>out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that was all well and good </v>

20
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:13.971
<v Speaker 1>until,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as he was broke until the next </v>

21
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>check showed up and then bang the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

22
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:19.401
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like money is necessarily a </v>

23
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>good for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard manage money.</v>

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy for it to disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean elderly people have a hell of a </v>

25
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.751
<v Speaker 1>time now because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crooks are contacting them on the </v>

26
00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Internet nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just giving people money,</v>

27
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>money's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like pouring water in their hands.</v>

28
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not that helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily that helpful.</v>

29
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>And then of course contributors to </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty are well,</v>

30
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not so good to have a low Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.420
<v Speaker 1>people don't like the idea of Iq because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems so arbitrary,</v>

32
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a high Iq.</v>

33
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not like you deserved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

34
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>It's your setup that way pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>right from the beginning.</v>

35
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

36
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very stable.</v>

37
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>You can make a high Iq person stupider </v>
<v Speaker 1>by not educating them up to the level of</v>

38
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:12.081
<v Speaker 1>their possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but taking someone who has a low Iq and </v>

39
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:15.291
<v Speaker 1>trying to raise that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you can figure out how to </v>

40
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:17.601
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know it's Nobel prize time for </v>

41
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you because people have tried that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most recently with those,</v>

42
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:25.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luminol lumosity games and that sort of </v>

43
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:27.771
<v Speaker 1>thing and the evidence that those </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce anything other than brilliant </v>

44
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>performances on the lumosity game itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically zero.</v>

45
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been able to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see cause I intelligence is a cross </v>

46
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.281
<v Speaker 1>domain phenomena and you can get really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good in a single domain by practicing </v>

47
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:47.991
<v Speaker 1>like Matt and what you'd want is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice like matt in a single domain </v>

48
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>and hope that it generalizes to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>domains.</v>

49
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>That's the holy grail of intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and creeks.</v>

50
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

51
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>no one's done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People claim it,</v>

52
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.790
<v Speaker 1>but the claims never hold up and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been trying for a long time to do </v>

53
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.500
<v Speaker 1>it and they haven't been able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

54
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>differences in Iq really make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

55
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys,</v>

56
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.420
<v Speaker 1>average Iq is probably one slash 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 30 ad at 1:15.</v>

57
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:24.451
<v Speaker 1>You're at the 85th percentile and 1:15</v>
<v Speaker 1>would barely get you going for you.</v>

58
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>For Harvard University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:30,</v>

59
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>you're probably graduate school material</v>
<v Speaker 1>1:45.</v>

60
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 1>You're up there at the range where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can probably do pretty much whatever you</v>

61
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although as you get smarter,</v>

62
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>the scatter between your abilities </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>

63
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>So you might have a very high verbal Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>but not be so good at mathematics or the</v>

64
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.470
<v Speaker 1>other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a massive contributor to </v>

65
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.471
<v Speaker 1>lifetime success and I don't know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do about that.</v>

66
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean why do smart people make more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>

67
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to where the edge of production</v>

68
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 1>is faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a thousand people and you</v>

69
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:12.841
<v Speaker 1>rank order them by ICU,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smart people are going to come up </v>

70
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:15.241
<v Speaker 1>with new ideas first and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have more ideas and they're going to </v>

71
00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:17.840
<v Speaker 1>strategize better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

72
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 1>with an Iq of 90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 15 percent of the population,</v>

73
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 1>you think about that 15 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

74
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.490
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much the threshold for </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading instructions and being able to </v>

75
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.490
<v Speaker 1>follow them.</v>

76
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.190
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our society is increasingly </v>

77
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.150
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's by no means obvious,</v>

78
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Liberals think well society is </v>

79
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.221
<v Speaker 1>unfair because there's unemployment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Conservatives think while there's a </v>

80
00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:53.910
<v Speaker 1>job for everyone and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of them think,</v>

81
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are massive,</v>

82
00:04:55.111 --> 00:05:00.111
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive differences in people's ability </v>

83
00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:03.380
<v Speaker 1>far greater than anyone realizes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that poses a structural problem.</v>

84
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I had a client and I got him a volunteer</v>
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>

85
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:11.010
<v Speaker 1>which is way harder than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a police check,</v>

86
00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:16.011
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's harder to get a volunteer job </v>

87
00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:17.310
<v Speaker 1>than a real job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I regard them in a volunteer job and</v>

88
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.780
<v Speaker 1>he had to fold pieces of paper letters </v>
<v Speaker 1>was he worked at a charity.</v>

89
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
<v Speaker 1>He had to follow up pieces of paper in </v>
<v Speaker 1>three so that he could put them inside </v>

90
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>envelopes and,</v>

91
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>and then the letters which were in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pile had to be matched with the proper </v>

92
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.790
<v Speaker 1>envelopes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're also in a pile,</v>

93
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.920
<v Speaker 1>but some of them were French and some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrangling.</v>

94
00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:41.000
<v Speaker 1>So the French ones had to be matched </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully to the French envelopes.</v>

95
00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:42.890
<v Speaker 1>And then if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 1>if there was one envelope out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of order,</v>

97
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.240
<v Speaker 1>well then he had to figure out whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the papers that were out of order</v>

98
00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:55.241
<v Speaker 1>or the letters that were out of order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then some of the letters had </v>

99
00:05:55.911 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>photographs attached them and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't supposed to bend the photographs</v>

100
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:04.661
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't always in the same </v>

101
00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:06.041
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that meant you had to figure out how </v>

102
00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:08.231
<v Speaker 1>to fold the paper in three a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways without creasing the </v>

103
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>photograph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing is,</v>

104
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.930
<v Speaker 1>and I never realized how difficult it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put a piece of paper in an envelope </v>

105
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.630
<v Speaker 1>until I watched someone who couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and he probably had an Iq of about </v>

106
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>if you met him on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't think anything different of</v>

108
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

109
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>He was normal looking guy had some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

110
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trained him to fold those damn papers </v>

111
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>for like 30 hours and he got reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at it.</v>

112
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.420
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're good at it and you probably </v>

113
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.621
<v Speaker 1>all are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fold it and the edges line up </v>

114
00:06:47.621 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 1>exactly like really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

115
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 1>The tolerance is probably half a </v>
<v Speaker 1>millimeter or something like that.</v>

116
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Then you do the second fold and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance is the same.</v>

117
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>But let's imagine that the first full </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

118
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 1>you're out by an eighth of an inch in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second full year out by an eighth of</v>

119
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 1>an inch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little crooked.</v>

120
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Not means in totally route by a quarter </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an inch.</v>

121
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Then it won't fit in the damn envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you kind of crumpled envelope </v>

122
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 1>when you put it in there and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets stuck in the sorting machine.</v>

123
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.240
<v Speaker 1>And so he sweated blood trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that job and eventually big eventually </v>

124
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 1>plan to fire him.</v>

125
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.120
<v Speaker 1>So imagine what that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

126
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you know you can't get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so you get a job at a charity </v>

127
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 1>as a volunteer and a charity decides to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire you.</v>

128
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really that's just.</v>

129
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.990
<v Speaker 1>So I talked to the woman who was running</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and suggested that that might be a </v>

130
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 1>little on the devastating side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

131
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>she had her reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

133
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.390
<v Speaker 1>he was always asking people questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to do his job and you know,</v>

134
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.430
<v Speaker 1>so that meant he was interfering with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the productivity of other people and it </v>

135
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.560
<v Speaker 1>was genuine interference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

136
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:08.561
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't being mean and it was her job</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure the place did what it was </v>

137
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 1>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

138
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was between a rock and a hard place.</v>

139
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he eventually decided that the job </v>

140
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.691
<v Speaker 1>wasn't for him and relatively soon after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think it was too stressful and </v>

141
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he quit.</v>

142
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 1>So that solved that problem except then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have job,</v>

143
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.640
<v Speaker 1>which of course is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

144
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 1>it has a happy ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This story,</v>

145
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.700
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

146
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>he got a dog because he was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>lonesome.</v>

147
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 1>And that dog man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having that guy trained,</v>

148
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 1>that dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was something else,</v>

149
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:48.551
<v Speaker 1>that dog just think he lost 30 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>while he was training that dog because </v>

150
00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:48.551
<v Speaker 1>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

151
00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant.</v>

152
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>And he had to have a tussle with the dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out who was in charge and it's</v>

153
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 1>a lot of responsibility to have a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was pretty damn committed to that</v>

154
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he managed it.</v>

155
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>The things he went through to keep that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>

156
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 1>You just cannot possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

157
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a surreal.</v>

158
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 1>It was surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the nuclear missile silo.</v>

159
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had people following him around </v>

160
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>informing on him because they thought he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was abusing the dog when in fact,</v>

161
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:19.070
<v Speaker 1>because I watched the dog was clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>abusive.</v>

162
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he got a job helping a woman who </v>

163
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>trained dogs and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he had a job.</v>

164
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 1>So Hooray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:35.631
<v Speaker 1>but it was like a miracle fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

166
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:41.181
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm telling you all this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was a reason for the Cold </v>

167
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:45.110
<v Speaker 1>War and the reason was that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality and there's different </v>

168
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:51.111
<v Speaker 1>theories about how to address that </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality and different theories about </v>

169
00:09:51.111 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>why it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a Marxist theory about why</v>

170
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:59.061
<v Speaker 1>it exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was roughly something like </v>

171
00:09:59.061 --> 00:10:01.221
<v Speaker 1>property equals theft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those who have more have taken it </v>

172
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:04.911
<v Speaker 1>from those who have less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to me to eliminate any </v>

173
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:09.330
<v Speaker 1>conceptual lization that there isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed pot of money,</v>

174
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money expands actually as we become more</v>

175
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.080
<v Speaker 1>technologically proficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of people who have money have </v>

176
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.430
<v Speaker 1>it because they've generated a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>

177
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates is a great example of that,</v>

178
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He popularized computing,</v>

179
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 1>he made it possible for everybody to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have access to computing.</v>

180
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like a good good for him.</v>

181
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:36.681
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could say the same thing about </v>

182
00:10:36.681 --> 00:10:38.871
<v Speaker 1>Steve jobs and maybe you'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say the same thing about Elon Musk and </v>

183
00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:42.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys have tremendous resources at </v>

184
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:42.970
<v Speaker 1>their disposal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

185
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 1>they're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not bathing in bank notes.</v>

186
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

187
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to continue to do things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they use their money to do things.</v>

188
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>
