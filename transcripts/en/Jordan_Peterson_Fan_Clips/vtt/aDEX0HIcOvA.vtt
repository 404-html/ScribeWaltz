1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>There was a cat that they recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:08.571
<v Speaker 1>a prehistoric cat that had this bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>single tooth and they found out that if </v>

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>a human skull fit right inside its mouth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it could grab you here and Pierce</v>

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>the back of your skull with its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with its single tooth and that's what it</v>

5
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>was evolved for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>it's under such conditions we evolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're predators obviously,</v>

7
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>but were tasty predators and so other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things were perfectly happy to eat us.</v>

8
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're aware you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do,</v>

9
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:41.741
<v Speaker 1>you act like a prey animal and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably what you should do because </v>

10
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you keep your head down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut the hell up,</v>

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>there will be any attention to attracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and maybe you'll get through it.</v>

12
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might decide unlikely to intervene </v>

13
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>and take the guy down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

14
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>but you would be the exception rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the norm.</v>

15
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's unsurprising.</v>

16
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I came to understand was the </v>

17
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.131
<v Speaker 1>belief systems regulated emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not exactly psychologically like it </v>

18
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>isn't exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

19
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:27.951
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is sort of like the terror </v>

20
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:29.871
<v Speaker 1>management theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly like you have a theory </v>

21
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>in your head and the theory explains the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and because of the theory explains</v>

22
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory is what's making you secure.</v>

23
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have a theory in your head</v>

24
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>and the theory makes you feel secure </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it explains the world,</v>

25
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:45.261
<v Speaker 1>but the reason that explains the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because other people have the same </v>

26
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>theory in their head and then when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>both act out the theory,</v>

27
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 1>you both get what you want and it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the coming together of the theory </v>

28
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>and the outcome that makes you.</v>

29
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>It's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only does it stop you from being </v>

30
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>anxious and often make you happy because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what you want,</v>

31
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we cooperate within our societies.</v>

33
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>We match our belief systems and then act</v>
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>

34
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 1>That's the predicate for a productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

35
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't just that it saves,</v>

36
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>saves you from death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

37
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>like the terror management theorists </v>
<v Speaker 1>have it.</v>

38
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it saves you from death and that's good.</v>

39
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being protected from death,</v>

40
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:31.560
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh good,</v>

41
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>that's great too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

42
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>but actually not dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of the fundamental thing </v>

43
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.211
<v Speaker 1>that you're after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so people have reason to defend </v>

44
00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>their territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think of territory that way,</v>

45
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>as you think about it as a domain where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental presuppositions of each </v>

46
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>citizen are matched by the behavior of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their coast citizens,</v>

47
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>they have every reason to defend that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it falls apart,</v>

48
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>it can have mortally serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

49
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>and that chaos doesn't just destabilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

51
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it destabilizes everything.</v>

52
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>It can destabilize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The currency can be stabilized,</v>

53
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>the industrial economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can,</v>

54
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>the lights can go off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not good,</v>

55
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>so hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wonder people protect it.</v>

56
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>So then I started thinking about what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief system was and I realized that a </v>

57
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>belief system was actually a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moral guidelines</v>

58
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>and moral guidelines are guidelines </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how you should behave.</v>

59
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you should perceive and the reason </v>

60
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.801
<v Speaker 1>that a moral guideline is necessary for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to perceive is that you can't look </v>

61
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 1>at anything without a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

62
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it like how many things in </v>

63
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.970
<v Speaker 1>this room could you look out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an in innumerable things in this</v>

64
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:05.730
<v Speaker 1>room to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just all this squares,</v>

65
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:10.731
<v Speaker 1>the little tiny squares in this fabric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look at those things for til </v>

66
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:11.370
<v Speaker 1>the end of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one at a time,</v>

67
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:13.710
<v Speaker 1>but you don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

68
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:18.711
<v Speaker 1>if I took most of you out of this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very low probability that </v>

69
00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:23.001
<v Speaker 1>you'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be able to tell me what color the </v>

70
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:25.100
<v Speaker 1>walls were or even if those things were </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the walls and the reason for that is </v>

71
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:30.480
<v Speaker 1>that who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as the walls don't move,</v>

72
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>colors irrelevant and there's no reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to remember it.</v>

73
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.830
<v Speaker 1>It has no emotional significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has no value,</v>

74
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.070
<v Speaker 1>and so what you do instead is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

75
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.100
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why are you here?</v>

76
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean in the broad metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

77
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean specifically why are you here </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

78
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:04:52.051 --> 00:04:56.640
<v Speaker 1>you're a students obviously and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get a degree and you know,</v>

80
00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>you believe that that will have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional utility.</v>

81
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll be a little wiser and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little more literate and a little and be</v>

82
00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:08.481
<v Speaker 1>able to think a little better and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to write a little better and so </v>

83
00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:08.481
<v Speaker 1>you'll actually be more functional in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

84
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

85
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:13.080
<v Speaker 1>and and maybe you're interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

86
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:18.081
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in this particular lecture so </v>

87
00:05:18.081 --> 00:05:21.570
<v Speaker 1>that you can take this particular class </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you can get a particular kind of</v>

88
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:26.571
<v Speaker 1>degree so that you can launch your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in your life you're probably </v>

89
00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:30.561
<v Speaker 1>going to meet someone that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm relationship with and you're </v>

90
00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:33.120
<v Speaker 1>going to have children and you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to partake in the society and that's why</v>

91
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:33.600
<v Speaker 1>you're here.</v>

92
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.740
<v Speaker 1>All of those reasons simultaneously is </v>
<v Speaker 1>why you're here.</v>

93
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.310
<v Speaker 1>And so then that helps you decide what </v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at.</v>

94
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.880
<v Speaker 1>And so what you look at is at the moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>or listened to is me because in </v>

95
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:53.001
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the gateway to that set of </v>

96
00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:57.741
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments at this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you focus on me and that's </v>

97
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 1>because you value that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is you can't even</v>

98
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>look at the world without a value </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

99
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's chaos if everything is equally </v>

100
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.920
<v Speaker 1>unimportant or if everything is equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

101
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.530
<v Speaker 1>It's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so value system structures the very </v>

102
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>way that you perceive the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean that metaphysically.</v>

103
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:25.481
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of experiments that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated that the invisible gorilla </v>

104
00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:25.481
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

105
00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>how many of you knew about the invisible</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla experiment,</v>

106
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.640
<v Speaker 1>how many don't?</v>

107
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

108
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.010
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that there are two </v>

109
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.041
<v Speaker 1>teams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a white team dressed dressed in white </v>

110
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>and the team dressed in black and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's video of them and the black team</v>

111
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:48.011
<v Speaker 1>is passing the basketball back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the white team is passing the </v>

112
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 1>basketball back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're supposed to count the Times.</v>

113
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>The basket ball gets passed back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

114
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 1>There's only one basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

115
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you're diligent for whatever reason you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do what the experiment or asks you and </v>

116
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>you count the basketball tosses and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

117
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>well that's not so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 16.</v>

118
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 1>So you tell them 16 and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you see the gorilla?</v>

119
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>And half of you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

120
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the experimenter says,</v>

121
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's watch again,</v>

122
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 1>but this time don't count all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough,</v>

123
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 1>like 30 seconds into the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

124
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:24.620
<v Speaker 1>the players fill the video screen.</v>

125
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're 300 yards in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>

126
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:31.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like little ants playing basketball </v>

127
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:31.841
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

128
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Filling the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see their faces.</v>

129
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough a minute into the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy in a gorilla suit and he's not </v>

130
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>little and neither is the gorilla suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes out,</v>

131
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.420
<v Speaker 1>bangs his chest right in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen for five seconds and then </v>

132
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>disappears and half more than half </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

133
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 1>if people don't see that and it's even </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse down.</v>

134
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Simon did another experiment where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at a counter,</v>

135
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a store and there's a clerk there and</v>

136
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.990
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to the clerk and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>clerk goes down hypothetically to get </v>

137
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:10.331
<v Speaker 1>something in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A different clerk pops up and you'd </v>

138
00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:10.331
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

139
00:08:10.331 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I noticed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>

140
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And you can even vary the clerk quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and people don't notice.</v>

141
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.200
<v Speaker 1>So we focus on very particular things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we don't notice this </v>

142
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>because it actually doesn't matter in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the ongoing,</v>

143
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.720
<v Speaker 1>our ongoing action at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clerk is interchangeable as long as </v>

144
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>the entity there acts like a clerk </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sufficient.</v>

145
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.560
<v Speaker 1>So belief system structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your perceptions,</v>

146
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>value systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to call them systems.</v>

147
00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>They structure your perceptions and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>also guide your actions because you act </v>

148
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 1>in accordance with your values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious or unconscious.</v>

149
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.240
<v Speaker 1>You have values that you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about because you just don't know </v>

150
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:11.240
<v Speaker 1>yourself very well.</v>

151
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 1>The you can tell that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have values that you don't know</v>

152
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.550
<v Speaker 1>very well because sometimes you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to people that you know,</v>

153
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a mistake.</v>

154
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to tell yourself to study </v>

155
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:27.380
<v Speaker 1>and you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

156
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.610
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not really in control of yourself</v>

157
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 1>to any great degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some and the more integrated you are,</v>

158
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 1>the more control you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

159
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:39.441
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of a loose collection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing subpersonalities and they're </v>

160
00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:41.640
<v Speaker 1>more or less directed towards a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

161
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 1>But it depends on how committed you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that goal.</v>

162
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>How much you've thought it through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you buy into it,</v>

163
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.520
<v Speaker 1>how many of the contradictions in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>world representation you've managed to </v>

164
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 1>iron out and all of that.</v>

165
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.060
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

166
00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:01.510
<v Speaker 1>but in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's value systems that government </v>

167
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.170
<v Speaker 1>action and perception.</v>
