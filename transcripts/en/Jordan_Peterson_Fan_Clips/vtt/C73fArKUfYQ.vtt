1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>There's the People's Republic of China </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a different country,</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.340
<v Speaker 1>like seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different country,</v>

3
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different tradition,</v>

4
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.950
<v Speaker 1>different language.</v>

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.310
<v Speaker 1>How many people died in China under Mao?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows.</v>

6
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Same issue with the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although Myra was a bigger monster than </v>

7
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Stalin and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's impressive.</v>

8
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's Hitler,</v>

9
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.820
<v Speaker 1>there's Stalin and Mao and of the three </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile was probably the worst.</v>

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>He's still revered in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that accounts for their affinity </v>

11
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>for North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could still destroy us.</v>

12
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:43.031
<v Speaker 1>All the remnants of that horrible state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 100 million people died in China </v>

13
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 1>during the great leap forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a leap forward.</v>

14
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it wasn't 100 million,</v>

15
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was only $40 million,</v>

16
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.710
<v Speaker 1>but as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're counting in the tens of </v>

17
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>millions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your points already made.</v>

18
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:02.471
<v Speaker 1>And then there was Cambodia and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing fields and Bulgaria in east </v>

19
00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Germany and Romania and the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>People's Republic of Korea.</v>

20
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>That's North Korea and Vietnam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia,</v>

21
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Hungary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

22
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

23
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.630
<v Speaker 1>There was never a successful communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>state cube I suppose came closest,</v>

24
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>but it was radically,</v>

25
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

26
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>the Soviets poured money into Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't really count.</v>

27
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>So then the first question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>are these Marxists motivated by love or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred?</v>

29
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

30
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>is it love or hatred that produces 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million dead people?</v>

31
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Is that enough evidence or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not enough evidence,</v>

32
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 1>if you think to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

33
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>that's not enough evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was never really given its proper,</v>

34
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>a proper try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

35
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would it been a proper try?</v>

36
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think when I hear someone say </v>

37
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>that I know what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think in your delusional arrogance,</v>

38
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 1>that you understand the Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrines better than anyone else ever </v>

39
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.581
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that if you were the one </v>

40
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:20.150
<v Speaker 1>implementing those doctrines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have ushered in the utopia.</v>

41
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what you mean when you say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no,</v>

42
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.770
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They saying there's an idea in the new </v>

43
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>testament that there's a sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sin against the holy ghost.</v>

44
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>If you commit that sand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one really knows what it is that you </v>

45
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>can't be forgiven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say,</v>

46
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:45.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want a candidate for the sin </v>

47
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>against the Holy Ghost and the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

48
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the statement communism,</v>

49
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>real communism was never tried with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying idea that if you had been the</v>

50
00:02:56.591 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 1>person implementing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have worked.</v>

51
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's pretty good contender for</v>
<v Speaker 1>something for which you should never be </v>

52
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:08.851
<v Speaker 1>forgiven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

53
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>so that's Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go onto postmodernism.</v>

54
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>We talked a little bit about it.</v>

55
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically,</v>

56
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.510
<v Speaker 1>it's an attitude of skepticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irony towards rejection of grand </v>

57
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.240
<v Speaker 1>narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies and universalism.</v>

58
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Crit criticizes objective notions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

59
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.910
<v Speaker 1>human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social progress,</v>

60
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:40.911
<v Speaker 1>absolute truth in objective reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's predicated on the idea that the </v>

61
00:03:40.911 --> 00:03:45.801
<v Speaker 1>reason that you categorize especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that you categorize is </v>

62
00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:48.750
<v Speaker 1>to marginalize you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>categorize,</v>

63
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:51.350
<v Speaker 1>to marginalize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to obtain power powers.</v>

64
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's other elements of postmodernism.</v>

65
00:03:57.511 --> 00:04:01.320
<v Speaker 1>One of them is that human nature is </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely a social construct.</v>

66
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.370
<v Speaker 1>See the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

67
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:07.110
<v Speaker 1>and this is a postmodern critique as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to move the center to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>margin and the margin to the centers.</v>

69
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Why would you think that human nature is</v>
<v Speaker 1>only a social construct?</v>

70
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why.</v>

71
00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:19.560
<v Speaker 1>It's because that means you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct it any way you want to thought</v>

72
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.470
<v Speaker 1>it was a very common idea among this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the communists.</v>

73
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

74
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why Michael wanted to wipe out </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese history.</v>

75
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:30.180
<v Speaker 1>That's why the red guard wind around in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China and trying to destroy everything,</v>

76
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.660
<v Speaker 1>every element of China's history prior </v>
<v Speaker 1>to approximately 1960 at that great </v>

77
00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:41.781
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands and thousands of years old as </v>

78
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:41.781
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could bring in the new man.</v>

79
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.860
<v Speaker 1>But what does the new man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it was whatever slave now happened </v>

80
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>to fantasize about or it was the utopian</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

81
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.750
<v Speaker 1>You take your pick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I said,</v>

82
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.840
<v Speaker 1>if you take a look at the corpses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pretty much figure out which of </v>

83
00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.370
<v Speaker 1>those two it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's up with these people?</v>

84
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.690
<v Speaker 1>These deconstructionists sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists.</v>

85
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.060
<v Speaker 1>What are they up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

86
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.890
<v Speaker 1>but here's the first thing</v>

87
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.080
<v Speaker 1>they came about pretty much when Marxism</v>
<v Speaker 1>was no longer credible,</v>

88
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.640
<v Speaker 1>no longer tenable as an intellectual set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of intellectual propositions.</v>

89
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were a French intellectual,</v>

90
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.820
<v Speaker 1>you had to have a lot of corpses piled </v>
<v Speaker 1>at your feet before you were willing to </v>

91
00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.350
<v Speaker 1>think that you were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an example.</v>

92
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the architect of the killing </v>

93
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.980
<v Speaker 1>fields in Cambodia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't Pol Pot,</v>

94
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:40.530
<v Speaker 1>it was one of his advisors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

95
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:45.531
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took his phd at the Sorbonne and he </v>

96
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:51.111
<v Speaker 1>developed the thesis in the Sorbonne </v>
<v Speaker 1>What Marxists thesis that the cities </v>

97
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:54.960
<v Speaker 1>were parasites on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the land.</v>

98
00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an extension of the whole </v>

99
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>bourgeoisie proletarian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cities were full of bourgeois types,</v>

100
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.681
<v Speaker 1>educated and educated parasites </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially who were doing nothing but </v>

101
00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:10.181
<v Speaker 1>stealing what was rightly the farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he came back to Cambodia,</v>

102
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.400
<v Speaker 1>he put that into action and emptied out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cities and put all the intellectuals</v>

103
00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:19.770
<v Speaker 1>and the city dwellers either to death or</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work,</v>

104
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>which generally resulted in death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed about one six to one quarter of </v>

105
00:06:25.261 --> 00:06:28.970
<v Speaker 1>the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got his phd from the Sorbonne.</v>

106
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a good story because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly how complicit the western </v>

107
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.401
<v Speaker 1>leftist intellectuals were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitating the horrors of the 20th </v>

108
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:43.120
<v Speaker 1>century and it's not like we've learned </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything since then.</v>

109
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just gone underground and that's </v>

110
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 1>what I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I see when I see </v>

111
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.490
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened was,</v>

112
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.170
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

113
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.810
<v Speaker 1>despite the affinity of Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals for Marxism,</v>

114
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe because they weren't paid as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>as bankers,</v>

115
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.830
<v Speaker 1>let's say if we're being cynical about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

116
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 1>because the thought that if you paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociologists as much as investment </v>

117
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 1>bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be capitalist very rapidly was.</v>

118
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Which is also to say that you may </v>
<v Speaker 1>underpay intellectuals at your peril and</v>

119
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:28.361
<v Speaker 1>you know that's actually dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that's </v>

120
00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:31.061
<v Speaker 1>happening is that as the universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>have become corporatized and corrupted </v>

121
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:35.051
<v Speaker 1>in a variety of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more of the professors or </v>

122
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:35.051
<v Speaker 1>adjuncts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

123
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's up to 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

124
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 1>50 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

125
00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:41.951
<v Speaker 1>Now they've got no tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got no job security and their </v>

126
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:41.951
<v Speaker 1>paid like $24,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

127
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea to radicalize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are teaching your children,</v>

128
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.950
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the sixties,</v>

129
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 1>so much data on the catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 1>failures of communism had accrued that </v>

130
00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:06.961
<v Speaker 1>even the most intransigent a French </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals had to admit that the Jig </v>

131
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>was up.</v>

132
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
<v Speaker 1>But that's a problem because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole ideology,</v>

133
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole raise on debt.</v>

134
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.830
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says in this terrible Alberta French,</v>

135
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you're going to just give that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do after that?</v>

136
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened was postmodernism was </v>

137
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.320
<v Speaker 1>invented and so it's a slight of hand as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell.</v>

138
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:40.321
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with postmodernism identity </v>

139
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:43.420
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the postmodern transformation is,</v>

140
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were a little wrong with the working </v>

141
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.391
<v Speaker 1>class thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out that Communists killed them </v>

142
00:08:51.391 --> 00:08:54.880
<v Speaker 1>all and capitalists make them all rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually exactly the opposite</v>

143
00:08:54.881 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>of we predicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe there's still a way this could</v>

144
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:01.710
<v Speaker 1>be salvaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about if we,</v>

145
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>we don't say working class capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we say oppressor or oppressed,</v>

146
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.340
<v Speaker 1>we'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well just trends transformed the </v>

147
00:09:14.141 --> 00:09:19.141
<v Speaker 1>terminology a bit and we'll start </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about all the other ways that </v>

148
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.621
<v Speaker 1>people are oppressed and then and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other ways that people are </v>

149
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:25.951
<v Speaker 1>oppressors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we can play the same damn game </v>

150
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:25.951
<v Speaker 1>under a new guys.</v>

151
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.870
<v Speaker 1>And now look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the postmodernists were Marxists.</v>

152
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>So let's make no mistake about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Derrida himself said that postmodernism </v>

153
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.500
<v Speaker 1>was a transformation of Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making this up.</v>

154
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 1>The question is why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

155
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 1>because you could say what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Postmodernism is a valid philosophical </v>

156
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.080
<v Speaker 1>school and we'll get into that for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute and they make some valid claims.</v>

157
00:09:44.081 --> 00:09:45.070
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

158
00:09:45.071 --> 00:09:50.071
<v Speaker 1>this is a central postmodernist claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's an infinite number of </v>

159
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:53.371
<v Speaker 1>ways of interpreting the world and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually turns out to be technically </v>

160
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:54.670
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason that we've had a very</v>

161
00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:59.671
<v Speaker 1>difficult time building robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ai robots that can operate in the real </v>

162
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:04.081
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because perceiving the real world </v>

163
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.110
<v Speaker 1>turns out to be so difficult that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>really can't figure out how human beings</v>

164
00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:10.111
<v Speaker 1>do it because it is susceptible to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of interpretations.</v>

165
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not going to give the </v>

166
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.410
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit for discovering that because it </v>

167
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.900
<v Speaker 1>was discovered simultaneously in about </v>
<v Speaker 1>five disciplines at pretty much the same</v>

168
00:10:19.901 --> 00:10:22.630
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you give the devil his due.</v>
