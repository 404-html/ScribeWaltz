00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2
00:00:00.561 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>in the Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.380
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name,</v>

4
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Frodo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

5
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.760
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not Bilbo,</v>

6
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo in Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of this little underdeveloped</v>

8
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>overprotected shire dweller and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called on a great adventure to go and </v>

9
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:24.841
<v Speaker 1>find the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he asked to become a thief in order </v>

10
00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:26.650
<v Speaker 1>to manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

13
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:33.901
<v Speaker 1>it's because as a good citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just not enough to conquer a </v>

14
00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asked to also become a bad citizen in</v>

15
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:42.241
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to incorporate the part of </v>

16
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:42.241
<v Speaker 1>themselves that's monstrous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

17
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>and develop that and hone it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

18
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 1>and that's to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>if you're harmless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not virtuous,</v>

20
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.030
<v Speaker 1>you're just harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like a rabbit.</v>

21
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Rabbit isn't virtuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

22
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.440
<v Speaker 1>just can't do anything except get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not virtuous.</v>

23
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>If you're a monster and you don't act </v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrously,</v>

24
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>then you're virtuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to be a monster while </v>

25
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.580
<v Speaker 1>you see this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter's like that too.</v>

26
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's flawed,</v>

27
00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 1>he's hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got evil in him.</v>

28
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 1>He can talk to snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

29
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 1>he breaks rules all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

30
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 1>He's not an obedient at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

31
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>he has a good reason for breaking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules and if he couldn't break the </v>

32
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.711
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and his little clique of rule </v>

33
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 1>breaking troublemakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they didn't break the rules,</v>

34
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.940
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't attain the highest goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very peculiar,</v>

35
00:01:33.941 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>

36
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:35.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

37
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common mythological notion.</v>

38
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.990
<v Speaker 1>The hero has to be,</v>

39
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>the hero has to be a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a controlled monster.</v>

40
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Batman is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's everywhere.</v>

42
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:54.551
<v Speaker 1>It's the story you always hear meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to be more precise.</v>

43
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good,</v>

44
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question because one </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is,</v>

45
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of implicitly moral insofar </v>

46
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.020
<v Speaker 1>as you're socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's sort of procedural.</v>

47
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just built into you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is different.</v>

48
00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:21.061
<v Speaker 1>This is also becoming conscious of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and expanding out your personality into </v>

49
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 1>dimensions that it wouldn't normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupy.</v>

50
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:26.530
<v Speaker 1>So this happens to people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

51
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>lots of my clients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my clinical clients are too agreeable </v>

52
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're generally women because women </v>

53
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.531
<v Speaker 1>are more agreeable than men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not always because I've had </v>

54
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:37.531
<v Speaker 1>agreeable man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his clients as well.</v>

55
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're resentful and they don't know </v>

56
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.061
<v Speaker 1>how to stand up for themselves and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're very compassionate by </v>

57
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:48.451
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're entering into a </v>

58
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:48.451
<v Speaker 1>negotiation with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll let you win.</v>

59
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not so good because you know you </v>

60
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>need to win too.</v>

61
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're in an organization </v>
<v Speaker 1>of adults where there's,</v>

62
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

63
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>When you have kids can let them win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially infants.</v>

64
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to let them win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why compassion is so </v>

65
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a,</v>

66
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>as a basis for negotiation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults,</v>

67
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

68
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>it's insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

69
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a bit of a monster so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can say no.</v>

70
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.220
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of what you do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapy is treat people's anxiety </v>

71
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>and depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge chunk of it.</v>

72
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Help them straighten out the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

73
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge chunk of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another chunk of it is,</v>

74
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's toughen you up.</v>

75
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put you in a position where you </v>

76
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.231
<v Speaker 1>can bargain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's teach you how to assert yourself </v>

77
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:40.171
<v Speaker 1>and stand up for yourself and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness training and it's a huge </v>

78
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>chunk of psychotherapy and you need to.</v>

79
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.690
<v Speaker 1>You need to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like because part of how you </v>

80
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.371
<v Speaker 1>regulate your interactions with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is to negotiate and you cannot </v>

81
00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 1>negotiate unless you can say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it.</v>

82
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>And its causes conflict to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't like conflict,</v>

83
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being agreeable,</v>

84
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.500
<v Speaker 1>then you can't tolerate the conflict and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you can't negotiate on your own </v>

85
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.050
<v Speaker 1>behalf and so then you keep losing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bullied and you know it's,</v>

86
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you get resentful and,</v>

87
00:04:09.211 --> 00:04:14.211
<v Speaker 1>and it's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to develop your inner </v>

88
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>monster a little bit and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that makes you a better person,</v>

89
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 1>not a worse person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>

90
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.900
<v Speaker 1>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

91
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.040
<v Speaker 1>but that's just how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Outside of that diagram is chaos itself,</v>

92
00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:36.390
<v Speaker 1>and that's the chaos from which things </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>

93
00:04:36.391 --> 00:04:41.391
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you much about that yet </v>

94
00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:43.671
<v Speaker 1>because it's too damn complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the best way to think about </v>

95
00:04:43.671 --> 00:04:45.780
<v Speaker 1>chaos is as potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

96
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 1>It's also that place you end up when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what to do.</v>

97
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.060
<v Speaker 1>It's the source of all things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the terrible Predator,</v>

98
00:04:56.061 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 1>the terrible eternal Predator that lurks</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the explored domain.</v>

99
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a winged dragon and it's winged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows why matter and spirit.</v>

100
00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:08.330
<v Speaker 1>That's partly what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll explain that later.</v>

101
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It's also potentially the predatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>beast that's been after us for for </v>

102
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.930
<v Speaker 1>forever and the winged Predator that </v>
<v Speaker 1>picked us up from the sky.</v>

103
00:05:17.931 --> 00:05:19.790
<v Speaker 1>So primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

104
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:23.780
<v Speaker 1>monkeys have some monkeys have three </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized alarm cries,</v>

105
00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:28.700
<v Speaker 1>one is for snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that usually means hit the trees and</v>

106
00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:33.701
<v Speaker 1>then one's for leopards and that means </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit the trees and go out on a skinny </v>

107
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:33.701
<v Speaker 1>branch because the leopard can't get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

108
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 1>And then there's one for like birds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prey,</v>

109
00:05:35.931 --> 00:05:39.410
<v Speaker 1>which means hide somewhere on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you don't get picked off.</v>

110
00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:40.850
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.090
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>

112
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's chaos and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's expanded into much more than </v>

113
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I showed you,</v>

114
00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:52.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember if I showed you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is,</v>

115
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 1>this is a symbolic representation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

116
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>father culture and the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>

117
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's all that's all positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no negative elements there,</v>

118
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a partial representation.</v>

119
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And those things are sacred in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense because they are representative of</v>

120
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>an ultimate reality of an ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

121
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>This sacrificial individual hear the </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering individual.</v>

122
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty straightforward.</v>

123
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's life,</v>

124
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 1>that's suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's life,</v>

125
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens to the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everyone is looking at that.</v>

126
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has power,</v>

127
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

128
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:40.061
<v Speaker 1>it's because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture supports the suffering </v>

129
00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:43.631
<v Speaker 1>individual and cultures nested inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolent nature and that's part of the</v>

130
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:48.821
<v Speaker 1>story of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's this part of the story we're </v>

131
00:06:48.821 --> 00:06:48.821
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate.</v>

132
00:06:48.821 --> 00:06:53.260
<v Speaker 1>We've been doing that for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years trying to make this story </v>

133
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.140
<v Speaker 1>articulate and it's not yet articulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

134
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.370
<v Speaker 1>It's only we're only getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're only getting it and we.</v>

135
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>We basically do that now mostly with </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies and stories and fiction and that </v>

136
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still don't have it articulated.</v>

137
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I think young went close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came closer than anyone else,</v>

138
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:11.390
<v Speaker 1>young and an Eric Norman who was one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his students,</v>

139
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.690
<v Speaker 1>came closer than anyone else ever has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually articulate that and that's what</v>

140
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>you was trying to do is to take all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these images,</v>

141
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>archetypal images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctual images and say,</v>

142
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they mean?</v>

143
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 1>What do they mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they mean?</v>

144
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.350
<v Speaker 1>And he got a long ways on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although his writing is quite obscure </v>

145
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.411
<v Speaker 1>and it's obscured because how the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to explain an image like </v>

146
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>that without being obscure?</v>

147
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's insanely complicated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not linear.</v>

148
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not a linear thing that that's why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in a picture because a picture </v>

149
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.070
<v Speaker 1>presents everything at once and you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take that apart linearly.</v>

150
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.060
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

151
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've been struggling to do that.</v>

152
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:55.301
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been struggling to do that from </v>

153
00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>the time we became self conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 1>what is the world about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should we live in it?</v>

155
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.150
<v Speaker 1>While that's a partial answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a culture bound answer </v>

156
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.391
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see archetipal representations </v>

157
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 1>like this and many cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

158
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>the image of the Virgin and child that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way predates Christianity.</v>

159
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Like the Egyptians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was isis and horace that goes back.</v>

160
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea how far thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years before the emergence </v>

161
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:27.191
<v Speaker 1>of Judaism and Christianity way back </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that and no doubt back into </v>

162
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:32.711
<v Speaker 1>prehistory itself because a culture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't hold the mother and child as </v>

163
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:39.341
<v Speaker 1>sacred dies obviously because obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>so it has to be held as a.</v>

164
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.140
<v Speaker 1>It has to be held as something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>revere,</v>

165
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.230
<v Speaker 1>which at least means you don't kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers and children and at least means </v>

166
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an instinct.</v>

167
00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an instinct.</v>

168
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 1>It violates you to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thank God.</v>

169
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take 15 minutes.</v>

170
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 1>So I told you about this a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>last week,</v>

171
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:16.011
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the motivations I had for </v>

172
00:09:16.011 --> 00:09:18.710
<v Speaker 1>thinking the things that I've thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the motivation I had for </v>

173
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.001
<v Speaker 1>thinking them through was because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I like it,</v>

174
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.140
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

175
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 1>it seemed self evident to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

176
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was partly from reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>young but not.</v>

177
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.620
<v Speaker 1>But that just helped me clarify it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was sort of young's contention </v>

178
00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:40.671
<v Speaker 1>that we had an organic development of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical ethic that was embedded in,</v>

179
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>in religious tradition and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically unfolded,</v>

180
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:51.450
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the West until about 1600,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1500,</v>

181
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

182
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.230
<v Speaker 1>And then science emerged and we got </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably technologically powerful on</v>

183
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.500
<v Speaker 1>and using a certain view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

184
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:05.590
<v Speaker 1>we're so technologically powerful but </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still not very wise and that just </v>

185
00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 1>seems to me to be a bad combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought about that a lot.</v>

186
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:11.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

187
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:16.671
<v Speaker 1>well how do you handle the combination </v>
<v Speaker 1>of exceptional technological power and </v>

188
00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 1>and an impaired ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say something like that </v>

189
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.021
<v Speaker 1>underdeveloped ethic or one even in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which you have no faith because you </v>

190
00:10:24.021 --> 00:10:27.981
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that the foundational elements </v>

191
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 1>of it are irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there in mythology,</v>

192
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:33.891
<v Speaker 1>there in religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't fit well with the scientific </v>

193
00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:34.680
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you rectify that problem?</v>

194
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.470
<v Speaker 1>And while that's a tough problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:41.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy problem and certainly it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the problem that young was trying to</v>

196
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:42.600
<v Speaker 1>address.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

197
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:45.680
<v Speaker 1>And along with that went an associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem which,</v>

198
00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:46.690
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

199
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:51.710
<v Speaker 1>what happened in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was so awful and in so many </v>

200
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:56.421
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just so unbelievably brutal and </v>

201
00:10:56.421 --> 00:10:59.541
<v Speaker 1>terrible and it was perpetrated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people and they were </v>

202
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 1>individual people and they weren't that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much different from normal people.</v>

203
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.530
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were normal people.</v>

204
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And so the other thing that struck me </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that it would be better if that sort</v>

205
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:13.461
<v Speaker 1>of thing didn't happen anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was trying to figure out what </v>

206
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>the hell could possibly be done about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

207
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:16.110
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of young's contention was while you</v>

208
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:21.111
<v Speaker 1>had to understand yourself as a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were ever going to maintain some </v>

209
00:11:21.111 --> 00:11:25.401
<v Speaker 1>control over the fact that you are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact the monster and that that could </v>

210
00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:26.310
<v Speaker 1>come forth if the situation is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

211
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems reasonable and so,</v>

212
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.260
<v Speaker 1>well it seemed to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:39.261
<v Speaker 1>people had to become wiser and of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very difficult thing to figure </v>

214
00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:42.240
<v Speaker 1>out because you could even question </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether there is such a thing as wisdom,</v>

215
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.310
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

216
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.160
<v Speaker 1>and then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's what the universities are </v>

217
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.160
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do.</v>

218
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Especially the humanities mostly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

219
00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:52.440
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to make you wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's for.</v>

220
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's doing a terrible job of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my estimation.</v>

221
00:11:55.991 --> 00:12:00.991
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more decimating people as far as I </v>

222
00:12:00.991 --> 00:12:03.661
<v Speaker 1>can tell and undermining whatever ethic </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have rather than making people </v>

223
00:12:03.661 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

224
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 1>But I think that we have to become wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a choice.</v>

225
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:15.211
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a matter of survival and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more than that because if you're </v>

226
00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:18.541
<v Speaker 1>wise in your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a way better life </v>

227
00:12:18.541 --> 00:12:21.560
<v Speaker 1>like incomparably better because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna sleep soundly with a good </v>

228
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:27.301
<v Speaker 1>conscience at night and you know people </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that's worth more than money and </v>

229
00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>that's worth more than money.</v>
