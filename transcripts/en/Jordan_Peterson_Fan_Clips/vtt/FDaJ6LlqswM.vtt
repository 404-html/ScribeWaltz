1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what time is it?</v>

2
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I started when 6:30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't stop them.</v>

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

4
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go for five more minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll wrap this up.</v>

5
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about intersectionality </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

6
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 2>and white privilege a bit.</v>

7
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

8
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 2>So I first said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

9
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 2>we analyzed Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we analyzed postmodernism.</v>

10
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I suggested that postmodernism was a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Marxist to keep going under a </v>

11
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.791
<v Speaker 2>new guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suggested that Marxism was </v>

12
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally based on hatred rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than sympathy and empathy.</v>

13
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.130
<v Speaker 2>I suggested that the corpses were the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evidence for that.</v>

14
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you why I think postmodernism is </v>

15
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally wrong.</v>

16
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.290
<v Speaker 2>now I want to talk to you a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>about white privilege.</v>

18
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't got this quite figured out</v>

19
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:32.091
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't quite figure out why the </v>

20
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 2>postmodernists have made the canonical </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinctions.</v>

21
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 2>They've made race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity,</v>

22
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 2>sexual proclivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual,</v>

23
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.910
<v Speaker 2>gender identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say those are four dimensions </v>

24
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.511
<v Speaker 2>along which people vary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a very large number of </v>

25
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 2>dimensions along which people vary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

26
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that there's an infinite number of</v>

27
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:56.361
<v Speaker 2>ways of interpreting the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can immediately point out that </v>

28
00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:57.690
<v Speaker 2>there's an infinite number of dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 2>along which people vary,</v>

29
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 2>and so then the postmodern question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you privilege some of those </v>

30
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 2>dimensions over the other?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say,</v>

31
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:08.421
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it sustains your bloody Marxist </v>

32
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:08.421
<v Speaker 2>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

33
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to say that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it marginalizes,</v>

34
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've marginalized that so you can </v>

35
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.371
<v Speaker 2>ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the fun things about </v>

36
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:16.371
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

37
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a very vulgar image in my mind,</v>

38
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 2>but I won't share that with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can infer it.</v>

39
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Here's some ways people differ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intelligence,</v>

40
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 2>temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geography,</v>

41
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 2>historical time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live now in not 100 years ago.</v>

42
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Attractiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big.</v>

43
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

44
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Would you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could.</v>

45
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>We won't.</v>

46
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.000
<v Speaker 2>We won't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either.</v>

47
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 2>You eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's advantageous to be young.</v>

48
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 2>You've got potential disadvantageous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be old.</v>

49
00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 2>You've got wealth health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.</v>

50
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Sex women have advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men have advantages.</v>

51
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe one has more than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not self evident.</v>

52
00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Women live about eight years longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

53
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Athleticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

54
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.510
<v Speaker 2>family structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendship,</v>

55
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.090
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then there's the classic,</v>

56
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern once,</v>

57
00:03:14.631 --> 00:03:15.590
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity,</v>

58
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not those other dimensions of </v>

59
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.671
<v Speaker 2>variation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence that they're less </v>

60
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:24.671
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

61
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.490
<v Speaker 2>there's quite a bit of evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more important,</v>

62
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.150
<v Speaker 2>so like Why not consider them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you get intersectionality.</v>

63
00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:34.151
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>comical I think because the </v>

64
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.300
<v Speaker 2>postmodernists identity politics types </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually realized this.</v>

65
00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:36.230
<v Speaker 2>They thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

66
00:03:36.231 --> 00:03:37.370
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>race and gender.</v>

67
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

68
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.820
<v Speaker 2>What if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you're a black woman?</v>

69
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem because,</v>

70
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.820
<v Speaker 2>well now you've got two dimensions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiation.</v>

71
00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:49.020
<v Speaker 2>What the hell are we going to do about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

72
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:51.810
<v Speaker 2>And what if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you're gay and black and female?</v>

73
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Well then what if you're not very bright</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gay and black and female,</v>

74
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.040
<v Speaker 2>and then what if you're ugly and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>very bright and gay and black and </v>

75
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.010
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like you can keep playing that game.</v>

76
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.520
<v Speaker 2>You can keep playing that game and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite number of ways because there's </v>

77
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.010
<v Speaker 2>an infinite number of ways to categorize</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

78
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:13.011
<v Speaker 2>As The postmodern authority pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the intersectionality theorist </v>

79
00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:14.310
<v Speaker 2>came along to plug the hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know where they're going.</v>

80
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.520
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand that the logical </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion of intersectionality is </v>

81
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.331
<v Speaker 2>individuality because there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways of categorizing people's </v>

82
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.690
<v Speaker 2>advantages and disadvantages that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>take that all the way out to the end,</v>

83
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

84
00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:29.910
<v Speaker 2>the individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate minority,</v>

85
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.510
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly right and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what the west discovered and you</v>

86
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.290
<v Speaker 2>know the intersection lists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so get there if they don't kill everyone</v>

87
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.300
<v Speaker 2>first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so onto white privilege.</v>

88
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.540
<v Speaker 2>So it's really interesting to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>where these ideas come from because it's</v>

89
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:54.230
<v Speaker 2>usually the scholarship is so awful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just cannot possibly believe it.</v>

90
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:57.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't.</v>

91
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.810
<v Speaker 2>In at the university of toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the psychology department,</v>

92
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 2>the original paper on white privilege </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have received a passing grade </v>

93
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.440
<v Speaker 2>for the hypothesis part of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergraduate honors thesis.</v>

94
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.470
<v Speaker 2>We're not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no methodology at all.</v>

95
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.620
<v Speaker 2>The person who wrote It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was called white privilege and male </v>

96
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.401
<v Speaker 2>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A personal account of coming to see </v>

97
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:23.570
<v Speaker 2>correspondences through work in women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies.</v>

98
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

99
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:26.420
<v Speaker 2>personal account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

100
00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:27.380
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

101
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

102
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 2>so she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she listed a bunch of ways that she </v>

103
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.121
<v Speaker 2>thought she says these are personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal examples of her unearned </v>

104
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:43.781
<v Speaker 2>privilege or unearned privilege that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw as she experienced in the 19 </v>

105
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:43.790
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 eighties.</v>

106
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 2>So this part of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this idea is the opinion of one </v>

107
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.971
<v Speaker 2>person who wrote one paper that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely no empirical backing </v>

108
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:56.381
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a set of hypotheses which had </v>

109
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:59.711
<v Speaker 2>never been subject to any statistical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I ask you a bunch of questions,</v>

110
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious how many questions I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>asking you because I could say,</v>

111
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 2>how tall are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or I could say,</v>

112
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 2>if you're laying on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how extended would you be?</v>

113
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 2>Like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two questions.</v>

114
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

115
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 2>it's one question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just asked two ways and the way you</v>

116
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 2>figure out if you ask someone a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>

117
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:20.981
<v Speaker 2>how many questions you're asking them is</v>
<v Speaker 2>by doing something called a factor </v>

118
00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:24.161
<v Speaker 2>analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of in an elementary form </v>

119
00:06:24.161 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 2>now of social science investigation.</v>

120
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.890
<v Speaker 2>If you make a questionnaire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to subject it to a factor </v>

121
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 2>analysis because you've got to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many questions you're asking because</v>

122
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 2>you might think it's 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably not.</v>

123
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 2>It's probably five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the big five,</v>

124
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

125
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Who cares about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing as methodology.</v>

126
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:44.351
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all part of the oppressive white </v>

127
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:47.291
<v Speaker 2>male european patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we can just not bother with that and </v>

128
00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:51.521
<v Speaker 2>we can pin a few notes about how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the world is constructed and then </v>

129
00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 2>we can screw up the entire political </v>
<v Speaker 2>system two decades later.</v>

130
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's your white privilege lists.</v>

131
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:03.341
<v Speaker 2>Some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like 50 things I can if I wish </v>

132
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:03.341
<v Speaker 2>arrange to be in the company of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my race,</v>

133
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 2>most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I should need to move,</v>

134
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:10.661
<v Speaker 2>I can be pretty sure of renting or </v>
<v Speaker 2>purchasing housing in an area which I </v>

135
00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 2>can afford and in which I would want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

136
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a wealth thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

137
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.370
<v Speaker 2>I can be pretty sure that my neighbors </v>
<v Speaker 2>in such a location will be neutral or </v>

138
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.521
<v Speaker 2>pleasant to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go shopping alone most of the </v>

139
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:24.101
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty well assured that I will not be </v>

140
00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:25.781
<v Speaker 2>followed or harassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can turn on the television or open to </v>

141
00:07:25.781 --> 00:07:28.841
<v Speaker 2>the front page of the paper and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>people of my waist race widely </v>

142
00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 2>represented when I'm told about our </v>
<v Speaker 2>national heritage or about civilization,</v>

143
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 2>I am shown that people of my color made </v>
<v Speaker 2>it what it is.</v>

144
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.110
<v Speaker 2>There's 50 of those I think something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

145
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that white privilege?</v>

146
00:07:42.841 --> 00:07:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Is that like majority privilege?</v>

147
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 2>It's the same tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to China,</v>

148
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:48.440
<v Speaker 2>you're chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the same?</v>

149
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're chinese,</v>

150
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.690
<v Speaker 2>does the majority privilege benefits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Majority privileges.</v>

151
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 2>Like isn't that just part of living </v>
<v Speaker 2>within your culture?</v>

152
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you live in your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're privileged as a member of that </v>

153
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.361
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while obviously that's what the culture </v>

154
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:07.361
<v Speaker 2>is for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's for.</v>

155
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Why would you bother building the damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing if it didn't accrue benefits to </v>

156
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.550
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you mighT say,</v>

157
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.781
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the consequences that it accrues </v>

158
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 2>fewer benefits to those who aren't in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture.</v>

159
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can immediately associate that </v>

160
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:22.300
<v Speaker 2>with race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just do that.</v>

161
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.070
<v Speaker 2>Say it's white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>privileged does many things it could be </v>

162
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.240
<v Speaker 2>certainly could be well and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intersectional people have already </v>

163
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 2>figured out that there's many things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be so like what the hell?</v>

164
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what's going on while we let these </v>

165
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.361
<v Speaker 2>pseudo disciplines into the university </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're stupid and guilty </v>

166
00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 2>seriously and they have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>methodological requirements and plenty </v>

167
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.301
<v Speaker 2>of power and plenty of time to produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsensical research and produce like </v>

168
00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:52.640
<v Speaker 2>resentful activists and now we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>bearing the fruits of that.</v>

169
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 2>IT's not pretty so privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

170
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:01.521
<v Speaker 2>the other thing you might notice is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>to attribute to the individuals of a </v>

171
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:07.071
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attributes of that community on the </v>

172
00:09:07.071 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 2>basis of their racial identity is called</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

173
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what racism is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way of defining it.</v>

174
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:18.290
<v Speaker 2>It's attributing to the individual the </v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics of the group as if the </v>

175
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.091
<v Speaker 2>group was homogenous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the intersection of people have </v>

176
00:09:23.091 --> 00:09:26.421
<v Speaker 2>already decided that's not a fair game </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's so many differences </v>

177
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:29.931
<v Speaker 2>between people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the postmodernist don't care about </v>

178
00:09:29.931 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 2>logical coherence because they regard </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical coherence.</v>

179
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Here it comes again as a creation of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>white european male patrIarchal </v>

180
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 2>structure that's designed to oppress the</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed,</v>

181
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.910
<v Speaker 2>and that's technically the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So logical,</v>

182
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 2>incoherence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter,</v>

183
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 2>and you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

184
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 2>if you act out your logically incoherent</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas in the world,</v>

185
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 2>you're going to run face first into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>brick wall,</v>

186
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 2>and the postmodern answer to that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's actually no real world.</v>

187
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.240
<v Speaker 2>It's all interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no,</v>

188
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:02.270
<v Speaker 2>there's no having that discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the modernists don't care because </v>

189
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 2>they don't believe that discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>between people of different power groups</v>

190
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

191
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 2>So here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

192
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:10.350
<v Speaker 2>so I made a case tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

193
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 2>I'll go over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the case?</v>

194
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.960
<v Speaker 2>The postmodernists are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're philosophically naive,</v>

195
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 2>they're right about an infinite number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of interpretations and wrong about a </v>

196
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.750
<v Speaker 2>finite number of viable interpretations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's like that's,</v>

197
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 2>that's death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the end of postmodernists theory </v>

198
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 2>and that's not the only way in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wrong.</v>

199
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.430
<v Speaker 2>They're wrong and a bunch of other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're more subsidiary.</v>

200
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.930
<v Speaker 2>The marxists.</v>

201
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.850
<v Speaker 2>They're not just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're wrong and murderous or wrong,</v>

202
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:47.330
<v Speaker 2>murderous and genocidal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you think murderers and genocidal</v>

203
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:52.570
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can think that there's lots of </v>

204
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.021
<v Speaker 2>would be revolutionaries who would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to have blood running in the </v>

205
00:10:56.021 --> 00:10:59.171
<v Speaker 2>street if they had their chance for </v>
<v Speaker 2>revenge and the opportunity to move up </v>

206
00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:03.371
<v Speaker 2>the hierarchy of charity so you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to think that murder and </v>

207
00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:07.811
<v Speaker 2>genocide is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if the right people are </v>

208
00:11:07.811 --> 00:11:07.811
<v Speaker 2>murdered in genocided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

209
00:11:07.811 --> 00:11:09.770
<v Speaker 2>That's actually part of the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole equation.</v>

210
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.040
<v Speaker 2>But if you're willing to think that </v>
<v Speaker 2>murder and genocide on a mass scale </v>

211
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.060
<v Speaker 2>across many cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over many decades is wrong.</v>

212
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Then marxism is wrong and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodernist don't get to just come </v>

213
00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:27.461
<v Speaker 2>along and adopt marxism as a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleight of hand because they're marx's </v>

214
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.020
<v Speaker 2>theory didn't work out and they figured </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a rationalization.</v>

215
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.050
<v Speaker 2>They don't get to get away with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's too dangerous.</v>

216
00:11:33.051 --> 00:11:38.051
<v Speaker 2>IT's too dangerous to the rest of us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't and it isn't necessary for us </v>

217
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 2>who are trying with the small part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our hearts that might be oriented </v>

218
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.541
<v Speaker 2>towards the good to allow people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulating us with historical </v>

219
00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:56.641
<v Speaker 2>ignorance and philosophical of hand to </v>
<v Speaker 2>render a so god damn guilty about what </v>

220
00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:01.060
<v Speaker 2>our ancestors may or may not have done </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that we allow our shame and our guilt</v>

221
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:06.061
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be used as tools to manipulate us </v>

222
00:12:06.061 --> 00:12:07.690
<v Speaker 2>into accepting a future that we do not </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have.</v>

223
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's that.</v>

224
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
