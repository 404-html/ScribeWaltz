1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Next equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equity,</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's worse,</v>

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equity means equality of outcome.</v>

4
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>It means that every single organization </v>
<v Speaker 1>has 50 percent women and 50 percent men.</v>

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.120
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter whether the men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women differ in their intrinsic </v>

6
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.981
<v Speaker 1>preferences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way they do the scientific </v>

7
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:24.891
<v Speaker 1>literature on that is completely clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was established by the early </v>

8
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:29.301
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was established in the Scandinavian </v>

9
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:31.761
<v Speaker 1>countries where they've done most to </v>
<v Speaker 1>flatten out the socioeconomic </v>

10
00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>differential between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't get rid of the differences </v>

11
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

12
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.520
<v Speaker 1>they became exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest personality differences in </v>

13
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>the world between men and women are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia,</v>

14
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:46.161
<v Speaker 1>just as the biggest differences in </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests between men and women are in </v>

15
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:49.071
<v Speaker 1>Scandinavia because when you get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sociocultural differences between </v>

16
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:54.051
<v Speaker 1>men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biological differences don't </v>

17
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They maximize how else could it be,</v>

18
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.020
<v Speaker 1>and as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the literature on that is clear and the </v>

19
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.780
<v Speaker 1>way that the postmodernists radicals </v>
<v Speaker 1>react to that is by criticizing the </v>

20
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>scientific method itself on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

21
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>which only work of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the scientific method.</v>

22
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

23
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.080
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

24
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.450
<v Speaker 1>You hear the egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clarion call everywhere.</v>

25
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Everything should be equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything should be equally </v>

26
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should strive for equity.</v>

27
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a conservative,</v>

28
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we want are just hierarchies of </v>

29
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.630
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone's a neurosurgeon.</v>

30
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your father has a brain tumor,</v>

31
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>you probably want a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence for neurosurgeons so you can </v>

32
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.610
<v Speaker 1>pick the one that's the best so that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>might not die.</v>

33
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what a hierarchy of competences </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

34
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>For the postmodernist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no hierarchy that isn't based on</v>

35
00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:58.150
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:03.151
<v Speaker 1>because they think the world runs on </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and that's why they're willing to </v>

37
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:05.260
<v Speaker 1>use power to get what they want because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only thing they believe in,</v>

38
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.930
<v Speaker 1>but a valid hierarchy of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's God,</v>

39
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>we need those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

40
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>We need the best plumbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need the best contractors.</v>

41
00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 1>We need the best.</v>

42
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 1>We knew we need the best carpenters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need the best lecturers.</v>

43
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a hierarchy of quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only so that we know who the best </v>

44
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:28.261
<v Speaker 1>are and can reward them properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so that we can reward them so they </v>

45
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>keep being the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know,</v>

46
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:30.850
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a great educator,</v>

47
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:33.050
<v Speaker 1>if you have a great leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

48
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>if you have a great thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to reward them so they keep </v>

49
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 1>thinking and they keep educating so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell you something.</v>

50
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not a reward for their intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

51
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a calculated move on your part to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suck everything out of them that's </v>

52
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>valuable as fast as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a hierarchy of competence is</v>

53
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:55.291
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that hierarchies of </v>

54
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:55.291
<v Speaker 1>competence don't exist is it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical,</v>

55
00:02:55.291 --> 00:03:00.271
<v Speaker 1>it's such a pathologically cynical idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually quite untrue because </v>

56
00:03:00.271 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>here's an interesting tidbit from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological literature.</v>

57
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you want to determine what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best predictors are for lifetime success</v>

58
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>in a Western society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:13.190
<v Speaker 1>what would you hope for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about intelligence there?</v>

60
00:03:13.191 --> 00:03:18.191
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's hope the smart people occupied </v>

61
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>more positions of complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Because they're smarter when you want it</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other way.</v>

63
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then so and that's great.</v>

64
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.940
<v Speaker 1>The number one predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment in western societies is </v>

65
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means the system works.</v>

66
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>What's the number to predictor </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness?</v>

67
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

68
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:38.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a trait marker for hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who called,</v>

69
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.740
<v Speaker 1>who gets ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart people who work hard now that </v>

70
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.241
<v Speaker 1>doesn't account for every bit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between people in terms of </v>

71
00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>their hierarchical structure because </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies aren't perfect.</v>

72
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:55.051
<v Speaker 1>They're corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get to the top sometimes because </v>

73
00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:55.051
<v Speaker 1>there's psychopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although believe me,</v>

74
00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:59.371
<v Speaker 1>a hell of a lot less than you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a psychopath has to keep moving </v>

75
00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:03.391
<v Speaker 1>from place to place because once he </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveals himself as deceitful and </v>

76
00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:06.741
<v Speaker 1>untrustworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to go find new soccer's to </v>

77
00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:06.741
<v Speaker 1>fleece.</v>

78
00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no distinction between a CEO and</v>

79
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:13.201
<v Speaker 1>a psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's only made by someone </v>

80
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Speaker 1>who a knows nothing about psychopaths </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

81
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:18.331
<v Speaker 1>knows nothing about ceos and c has </v>
<v Speaker 1>something fundamental against the entire</v>

82
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>capitalist structure because it's simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>

83
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes greedy,</v>

84
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>sometimes short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shortsighted,</v>

85
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.350
<v Speaker 1>sometimes running companies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing their best to auger themselves </v>

86
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 1>into the ground and so you know it's bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>people running a dying organization,</v>

87
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the case.</v>

88
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:41.431
<v Speaker 1>Our hierarchies of competence are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably functional and not only are </v>

89
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>they functional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're valuable.</v>

90
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 1>We need to know who the competent people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and we need to reward them and even </v>

91
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to tell young people,</v>

92
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some hierarchies of competence </v>

93
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.890
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thousand of them.</v>

94
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Go be a plumber man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be a good one.</v>

95
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being honest.</v>

96
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.150
<v Speaker 1>One B.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a plumber once,</v>

97
00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the night,</v>

98
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>it was the night before we were putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>drywall in our house.</v>

99
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>We were redoing a house and he had put </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all the plastic piping,</v>

100
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was going to test the joints,</v>

101
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:13.621
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're supposed to be glued together </v>

102
00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:13.621
<v Speaker 1>with his pipe glue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

103
00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:16.410
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told her I had to test the joints and </v>

104
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.410
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

105
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.410
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to test my joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never leave.</v>

106
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Can I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

107
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about if I test them?</v>

108
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>So I went up on the third floor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled the pipes with water,</v>

109
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.570
<v Speaker 1>capping them in the basement like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to.</v>

110
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Like half an hour later I had two inches</v>
<v Speaker 1>of water in the basement.</v>

111
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.400
<v Speaker 1>There were 30 leaking joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the night before the drywallers</v>

112
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>were supposed to show up so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he wasn't particularly competent.</v>

113
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the point of that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even more so he had put a bunch of </v>

114
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>plastic pipe outside where the drywall </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>

115
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>so it would have been sticking through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall.</v>

116
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>So I spent a frenetic night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>sawing through plastic pipe and re </v>
<v Speaker 1>gluing joints so that my.</v>

118
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>So that the drywallers could come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the point if you're going to be a</v>

119
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

120
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
<v Speaker 1>be a good plumber because otherwise all </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do is go out there and cause </v>

121
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't need people to cause more </v>

122
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need people to solve problems,</v>

123
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.170
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can be a tradesman and you </v>

124
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.911
<v Speaker 1>can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make a lot of money as a trades </v>

125
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:09.911
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody reliable,</v>

126
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>honorable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a forthright,</v>

127
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.690
<v Speaker 1>productive way of making a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is a hell of a lot of </v>

128
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.661
<v Speaker 1>difference between a working man who </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what he's doing and one who </v>

129
00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>doesn't both in terms of skill and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics.</v>

130
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you work with someone who knows what</v>

131
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:25.760
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody pleasure.</v>

132
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>They tell you what they're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you how much it will cost.</v>

133
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>They go and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works,</v>

134
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>and you pay them perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's happy,</v>

135
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 1>and that's what happens when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine hierarchies of competence and so</v>

136
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:41.951
<v Speaker 1>you to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You listen to these panderers of </v>

137
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:41.951
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gallery,</v>

138
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:45.490
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism and equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they fail to recognize completely </v>

139
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>that there are differences in rank </v>
<v Speaker 1>between people.</v>

140
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not such a terrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

141
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he wouldn't be a great lawyer like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly possible.</v>

142
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Most people aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean there isn't </v>

143
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.631
<v Speaker 1>something you could be great at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of hierarchies to attempt </v>

144
00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>to climb and if you fail in one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go try in another,</v>

145
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.070
<v Speaker 1>but the point is you're still trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>aim for the top and what the hell are </v>

146
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.070
<v Speaker 1>you going to do?</v>

147
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>If you don't try to aim for the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>flap about uselessly and whine about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

149
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will just make you miserable.</v>

150
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 1>You're not reliable to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't help out in a crisis.</v>

151
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you tell young people,</v>

152
00:07:18.841 --> 00:07:20.460
<v Speaker 1>and this is another message for </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>

153
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care why you're going to do,</v>

154
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 1>but go out there and make something of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself for God's sake,</v>

155
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:29.771
<v Speaker 1>be an honest person and work and get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of whatever it is that you want </v>

156
00:07:29.771 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 1>to get to the top of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

157
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.380
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

158
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.760
<v Speaker 1>and stand up for yourself like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectable human being and be a bit of </v>

159
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 1>a light on the world instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>blight.</v>

160
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell young people that and </v>

161
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.961
<v Speaker 1>they haven't been told that by anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and so the young men are so hungry </v>

162
00:07:46.961 --> 00:07:46.961
<v Speaker 1>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

163
00:07:46.961 --> 00:07:48.140
<v Speaker 1>it's painful to watch.</v>

164
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 1>They're so relieved when finally someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally comes up and says,</v>

165
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.480
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your act together,</v>

167
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>bit discipline yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can learn to tell the truth,</v>

168
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.360
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on something for a year or </v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

169
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 1>You could be a bloody world beater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that's possible.</v>

170
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be,</v>

171
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.060
<v Speaker 1>that would be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might make life or life worth </v>

172
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.060
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

173
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might.</v>

174
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:15.311
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you go do it now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the damn universities we're </v>

175
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be teaching people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've forgotten that.</v>

176
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>I went to Harvard month ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>month and a half.</v>

177
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.470
<v Speaker 1>He used to teach there and I talked to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of students.</v>

178
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 1>You know what I told them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to get into Harvard,</v>

179
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:26.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're a Valedictorian if you're at</v>

180
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Harvard and not only are you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Valedictorian,</v>

181
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 1>you're way better than most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least two other things or you don't </v>

182
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 1>get in.</v>

183
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 1>It's so like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the acceptance rate is</v>

184
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 1>like five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

185
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>not everybody applies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very selective school.</v>

186
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 1>And so why am I saying that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like these are high quality kids.</v>

187
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So I told them what I just told you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

188
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>here you are at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like get yourself educated man.</v>

189
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Read some books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to talk,</v>

190
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 1>learn to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make yourself into something,</v>

191
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 1>get the hell out there and make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that put you here.</v>

192
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Happy that you were put there in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>great institution,</v>

193
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they came up to me afterwards and </v>

194
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:09.260
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

195
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I wish someone would have told us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were in our first year.</v>

196
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

197
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 1>why didn't someone tell them that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>God's sake,</v>

198
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>university in the world.</v>

199
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Is it so difficult to figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.570
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that is what you want to have happen </v>

201
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.971
<v Speaker 1>in the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to make cringing milk sops who </v>

202
00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>whined about being victims while they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to ivy league institutions.</v>

203
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Jesus</v>

204
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.600
<v Speaker 2>pathetic.</v>

205
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Here's an old idea from Carl young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this idea.</v>

206
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:46.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a rough one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

207
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like a psychotherapeutic scalpel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say someone's doing something to </v>

208
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.710
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand.</v>

209
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>It's producing nothing but misery as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

210
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is your motivation?</v>

211
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.210
<v Speaker 1>They won't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't know.</v>

212
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:02.330
<v Speaker 1>So Carl [inaudible] advice was look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the outcome and infer the motivation.</v>

213
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you produce a generation of students </v>

214
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.570
<v Speaker 1>privileged beyond belief in comparison </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the rest of like struggling humanity </v>

215
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:16.521
<v Speaker 1>in all of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put them in Ivy League schools and </v>

216
00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:19.311
<v Speaker 1>they come out thinking that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of an oppressed group and </v>

217
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:19.311
<v Speaker 1>victims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

218
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:19.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you?</v>

219
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Why would anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would that happen?</v>

220
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.550
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

221
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:28.551
<v Speaker 1>that's what the people who taught them </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to turn them into and then you </v>

222
00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:28.551
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

223
00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:29.640
<v Speaker 1>did they do that because they cared for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

224
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It seems bloody unlikely to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take this great raw material,</v>

225
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:34.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

226
00:10:34.421 --> 00:10:39.421
<v Speaker 1>it's taken a lot of work to make an </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution like the University of </v>

227
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Toronto are like Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd been working on that for thousands </v>

228
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.980
<v Speaker 1>of years and you invite people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You thank God we selected you so </v>

229
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.281
<v Speaker 1>carefully because we think you can be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world beater and then what we do is we </v>

230
00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>don't teach you how to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't teach you how to speak.</v>

231
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:55.041
<v Speaker 1>We don't get you to read great books and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we convinced you that you're a victim </v>

232
00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:58.460
<v Speaker 1>and that your culture is corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So great with those people are no </v>

233
00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 1>friends of those institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that,</v>

234
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>and they're even less friends of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

235
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.970
<v Speaker 1>so hierarchies are cough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competence are desirable,</v>

236
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 1>and they should be promoted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So none of this idiot,</v>

237
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.650
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for anyone.</v>

238
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible.</v>

239
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be murderous to impose,</v>

240
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 1>but third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it succeeded,</v>

241
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.520
<v Speaker 1>it would fail as fast as it succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be how fast it would fail.</v>

242
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Why would you strive for anything if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no option to strive for?</v>

243
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.520
<v Speaker 1>If everything's flat and equal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

244
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 1>when you're starving or dying than </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's equal,</v>

245
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the egalitarian,</v>

246
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.400
<v Speaker 1>the iee Galitary and totalitarians who </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated the 20th century knew </v>

247
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.051
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well how to make people equal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they made them equal in gulag work </v>

248
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:48.921
<v Speaker 1>camps and in starvation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure we could attain that if we </v>

249
00:11:48.921 --> 00:11:48.921
<v Speaker 1>wanted to.</v>
