1
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Very heavily muscled Oliver Mccoll 29 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

2
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>as indeed is the reigning champion </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennox Lewis from Great Britain.</v>

3
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.450
<v Speaker 1>It's been said that Lennox Lewis really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't achieved the sort of popularity </v>

4
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>in this country that he would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>wished for,</v>

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.210
<v Speaker 1>but certainly there's no lack of support</v>
<v Speaker 1>here for him tonight.</v>

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Here in the Wembley arena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennox Lewis,</v>

7
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Lennox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courteous,</v>

8
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>born and West Ham on the second of </v>

9
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>September 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>65.</v>

10
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Comes in for the fourth defense of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>WBC heavyweight title,</v>

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.320
<v Speaker 1>the defending champion as home </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>

12
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>He's got a height and reach advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is unbeaten,</v>

13
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>whereas the challenger has got five to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feats on his record.</v>

14
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>The referee officially appointed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>WBC is from Mexico,</v>

15
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Jose Guadalupe Garcia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of what's shed for 12 rounds of </v>

16
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>world heavyweight championship boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the WBC title,</v>

17
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>the man told her that to Lennox Lewis </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion making us both defense of the </v>

18
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.930
<v Speaker 1>title one and perhaps some controversial</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

19
00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>but he's defended successfully three </v>
<v Speaker 1>times and Oliver,</v>

20
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>the atomic boma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was in the black trunks with the gold</v>

21
00:01:22.571 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>trimmed on the side as expected to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very worthy challenger.</v>

22
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Lewis coming in at exactly 17 stones and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal 16 and a half stones,</v>

23
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>and just about a quarter of upon Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm three inches taller,</v>

24
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>has that considerable range advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Macole has been in with a lot of </v>

25
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 1>very good opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Tony Tucker,</v>

26
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.010
<v Speaker 1>the man against whom Lewis made his very</v>
<v Speaker 1>first offense in Las Vegas in May of </v>

27
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 1>1995.</v>

28
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Great</v>

29
00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.550
<v Speaker 1>last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lewis was in this ring most of the feet </v>

30
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.231
<v Speaker 1>and Gary Mason for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.320
<v Speaker 1>British and European heavyweight titles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Mason summit,</v>

32
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>ringside making us come back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering will he ever get to fight at </v>

33
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>this level again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are willing dad ever get the fight?</v>

34
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:20.141
<v Speaker 1>Lennox Lewis champion Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he really needs a big one.</v>

35
00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:27.841
<v Speaker 1>He's not still terribly highly rated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>pundits across the pond in the United </v>

36
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.710
<v Speaker 1>States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas all of them are called,</v>

37
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.720
<v Speaker 1>certainly is rated as number one </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge by the three major governing </v>

38
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.060
<v Speaker 1>bodies of world boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>WBC,</v>

39
00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:43.061
<v Speaker 1>the WBA on the IVF.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man who was the former spawning </v>

40
00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 1>partner for Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them are caught in this country,</v>

41
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.660
<v Speaker 1>is expected to give limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a very hard fight and if he rips</v>

42
00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:01.661
<v Speaker 1>in anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right hands like that to the body of </v>

43
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.411
<v Speaker 1>Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then those predictions will be </v>

44
00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:06.571
<v Speaker 1>completely correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis tends to start a very tentative.</v>

45
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.530
<v Speaker 1>They did just that in is that last title</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense against Phil Jackson and </v>

46
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.271
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic City and May of this year </v>
<v Speaker 1>before getting to grips with the </v>

47
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>challenge than on winning the fight in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighth round.</v>

48
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>It does throw a very good right hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oliver mcfall and Louis will have to </v>

49
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.720
<v Speaker 1>watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tends to drop was left occasionally.</v>

50
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to work behind the Jab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's rather wild by mccall perhaps </v>

51
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.060
<v Speaker 1>wishes to pressurize the champion to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight over with us already as </v>

52
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.991
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've called very heavily muscled,</v>

53
00:03:44.071 --> 00:03:49.071
<v Speaker 1>very strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reckons he's in the best condition </v>

54
00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:49.071
<v Speaker 1>of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good right.</v>

55
00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Have a good slicing right by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion and that's the first time we've</v>

56
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:53.520
<v Speaker 1>seen about a strong punch by Louis,</v>

57
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.880
<v Speaker 2>but while opening first run the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>arena is by no means packed to capacity.</v>

58
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a tremendous amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes this a little bit of work </v>

59
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:23.821
<v Speaker 1>being done just underneath his left eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Final instruction.</v>

60
00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:36.221
<v Speaker 1>Then to Lennox Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting first one with both men </v>

61
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.060
<v Speaker 1>letting a little bit go from the armory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this pending</v>

62
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.660
<v Speaker 2>one suspects and Louis looking again </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind that has got very fast hands for </v>

63
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.770
<v Speaker 2>a big man</v>

64
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.700
<v Speaker 1>ethic Louis unbeaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

65
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>after</v>

66
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.900
<v Speaker 2>25 fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always got him walk into her right hand.</v>

67
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the sucker punch that they </v>

68
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.490
<v Speaker 2>worried about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little staggers on the referee has </v>

69
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.300
<v Speaker 2>decided it's all over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My goodness brought an upset on Lennox </v>

70
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His career must be in tatters.</v>

71
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.070
<v Speaker 2>Oliver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the atomic bomb,</v>

72
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.610
<v Speaker 2>mccall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 29 year old from Chicago,</v>

73
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 2>has stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lennox Lewis,</v>

74
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.770
<v Speaker 2>the WBC and heavyweight champion of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

75
00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:21.680
<v Speaker 2>and the second rod mccall says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you so.</v>

76
00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:26.681
<v Speaker 2>I told you so reminiscent of Mohammed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ali three decades ago.</v>

77
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Oliver them a call and his own terrorize</v>
<v Speaker 2>can not simply believe it themselves.</v>

78
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 2>It was a right hand delivered with </v>
<v Speaker 2>startling porosity and startling speed </v>

79
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 2>and Lennox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drop the lamp almost imperceptibly </v>

80
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 2>unwoke straight onto the classic sucker </v>
<v Speaker 2>punched and look at the difference in </v>

81
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.020
<v Speaker 2>the two corners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Willis cannot believe it.</v>

82
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.920
<v Speaker 2>His hope perhaps of a unification title </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Michael,</v>

83
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.610
<v Speaker 2>a rematch with Riddick Bowe who knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson and expected to come out of </v>

84
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.580
<v Speaker 2>on a fight in the offing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply cannot believe it because at the </v>

85
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 2>moment that would all seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely gone.</v>

86
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Pandemonium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair and the Wembley arena.</v>

87
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.730
<v Speaker 2>A Lennox Lewis content arts with only </v>
<v Speaker 2>less than a minute of the second ron </v>

88
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 2>gone the fraud can believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a tremendous punch.</v>

89
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 2>They hug and lists is smiling well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>lip as very badly cut.</v>

90
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:24.761
<v Speaker 2>The Not really was that bears testimony </v>
<v Speaker 2>to what was correcting shop on the </v>

91
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.160
<v Speaker 2>father of six children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 29 year old from Chicago has done </v>

92
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.331
<v Speaker 2>what nobody has ever done before on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stump Lennox Lewis and what time did </v>

93
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.600
<v Speaker 2>this most of career is defined by his </v>
<v Speaker 2>two losses.</v>

94
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Then by his 34 winds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only 17.</v>

95
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Chad's corralled by Louis Bipap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Po box numbers.</v>

96
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.220
<v Speaker 2>That's fewer than Lennox would want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow to be at his optimum,</v>

97
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:36.420
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't drawn that many punches.</v>

98
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 2>He's been under 40 punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heavyweight averages around 40 in most </v>

99
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 2>of his best efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lennox is much busier than that.</v>

100
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:50.951
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes 60 bunches around once or </v>
<v Speaker 2>twice and he comes up with that right </v>

101
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:53.280
<v Speaker 2>hand better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be careful.</v>

102
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 2>While Lewis hasn't been busy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has been accurate,</v>

103
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.940
<v Speaker 2>more accurate than rock mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that presents the classic quandary </v>

104
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.511
<v Speaker 2>for the better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is the one who lands on a higher </v>

105
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:11.581
<v Speaker 2>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better come on blinked that way.</v>

106
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.580
<v Speaker 2>He's having trouble and Louis goes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the body with the left top trying to get</v>

107
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 2>rock to bring his hands to give them </v>
<v Speaker 2>another shot.</v>

108
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:27.731
<v Speaker 2>At that swelling left up fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the heavyweight championship of the </v>

109
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:31.230
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got the so far,</v>

110
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to go.</v>

111
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:35.140
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't make any looks.</v>

112
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Don't touch your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep fighting.</v>

113
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:42.610
<v Speaker 2>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rachman has done a pretty good job of </v>

114
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.711
<v Speaker 2>staying off the ropes and toward the </v>
<v Speaker 2>center of the ring is disastrous moments</v>

115
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.880
<v Speaker 2>for against Moscow and to have occurred </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he had his back to the real that </v>

116
