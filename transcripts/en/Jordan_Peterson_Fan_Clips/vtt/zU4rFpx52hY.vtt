1
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>You can hear me ?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Hillier,</v>

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>that's for the introduction and also for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the invitation.</v>

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.480
<v Speaker 1>So not everyone will invite me places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's nice when an invitation shows </v>

5
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:23.031
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah and when I'm actually allowed to </v>

6
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:23.031
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also good.</v>

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>So I have a habit of not preparing my </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks until really the last minute.</v>

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.900
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that's not exactly true </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've been thinking about what </v>

9
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to you about tonight </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a very long time,</v>

10
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:42.021
<v Speaker 1>but I really only got the title for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk firmly in place about half an hour </v>

11
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I like to do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking to people is to tell them </v>

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>what I'm thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what I've already thought about,</v>

14
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and certainly not what I know,</v>

15
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to figure out.</v>

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me over the last year,</v>

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>somewhat surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I've been invited to speak in </v>

18
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 1>front of a lot of conservative groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

19
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them were conservative groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were composed of young people.</v>

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>And that was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:17.901
<v Speaker 1>because conservatism isn't something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's necessarily all that easy to sell</v>

22
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>to young people because they tend not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be that conservative to begin with.</v>

23
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>And conservatism also tends to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot to do with things that you </v>

24
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do and instead of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be allowed to do.</v>

25
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:35.481
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a restrictive element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that's also perhaps less attractive </v>

26
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:39.171
<v Speaker 1>to young people than it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do tend to get more conservative </v>

27
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>as they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as their personality shift.</v>

28
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I saw was very interesting </v>

29
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.541
<v Speaker 1>because I saw this was particularly true</v>
<v Speaker 1>of young men and I haven't quite puzzled</v>

30
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:49.950
<v Speaker 1>that out yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

31
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would talk about what was going on in </v>

32
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.591
<v Speaker 1>the universities and what I thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>might constitute a reasonable antidote </v>

33
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:57.591
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

34
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>not only in the universities but also </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>

36
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:06.081
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was both the adoption of </v>

37
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:09.681
<v Speaker 1>responsibility instead of the incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>and constant stress that's being placed </v>

38
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:14.331
<v Speaker 1>on rights and also the responsibility of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the citizen to speak forward what he or </v>

39
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:20.301
<v Speaker 1>she believed to be true or at least to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not speak what they knew to be false,</v>

40
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:26.271
<v Speaker 1>which is at least a good place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I found so </v>

41
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>remarkable was that this was actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>salable message to young people.</v>

42
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>And that surprised me because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't necessarily think that you </v>

43
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.151
<v Speaker 1>would turn a lot of lights on in a young</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience by talking to people about </v>

44
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>truth and responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you,</v>

45
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.310
<v Speaker 1>if you went to a marketing agency and </v>
<v Speaker 1>told them that that was going to be your</v>

46
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>political message to young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would tell you to go back and,</v>

47
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flesh out another plan,</v>

48
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.750
<v Speaker 1>sketch out another plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe young people have been talked </v>

49
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>to enough about rights for maybe about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next 15 decades.</v>

50
00:02:56.101 --> 00:03:01.101
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe there's a hunger a among </v>

51
00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>young people for something that has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit more respectability,</v>

52
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:09.331
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more depth than the </v>

53
00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:09.331
<v Speaker 1>constant emphasis on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on</v>

54
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.740
<v Speaker 1>doing whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you want.</v>

55
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about that,</v>

56
00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:20.261
<v Speaker 1>and the thing about rights in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of rights is that rights don't </v>

57
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:20.840
<v Speaker 1>really give you much direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.300
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

59
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.900
<v Speaker 1>they tell you what you are in principal </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to do,</v>

60
00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:25.700
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really tell you what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do.</v>

61
00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:30.701
<v Speaker 1>And it actually turns out that you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know what you should do because you </v>

62
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.611
<v Speaker 1>need to do something right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are active and our lives don't </v>

63
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>have any meeting without something to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

64
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.950
<v Speaker 1>and something that you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't just be something that you want</v>

65
00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:39.650
<v Speaker 1>to do that's too shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no deep meaning.</v>

66
00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:42.110
<v Speaker 1>There's no enduring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no sustaining meaning in that.</v>

67
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It's just impulsiveness and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the.</v>

68
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.010
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>

69
00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:51.011
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's entertaining and maybe it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's impulsively exciting and </v>

70
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:53.240
<v Speaker 1>fun and there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some utility in that for life.</v>

71
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.040
<v Speaker 1>But life is a very difficult journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it involves a lot of suffering</v>

72
00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:02.810
<v Speaker 1>and it involves a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of heavy existential weight and you need</v>

73
00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:07.811
<v Speaker 1>to be able to put something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a value up against that so that you can </v>

74
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:11.180
<v Speaker 1>withstand your life and you can stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some dignity and you can contribute</v>

75
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:13.910
<v Speaker 1>to your community and you can feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a worthwhile person,</v>

76
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in spite of all the things that are,</v>

77
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.820
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing wrong and in spite of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the problems that you have.</v>

78
00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:24.821
<v Speaker 1>And so then people need to know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should do and one of the things </v>

79
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:27.941
<v Speaker 1>they should do is take responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another thing they should do is try </v>

80
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:30.821
<v Speaker 1>to tell the truth because those two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things help them live proper lives and </v>

81
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:33.410
<v Speaker 1>then help society organizes itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

82
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good,</v>

83
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:36.500
<v Speaker 1>that's good for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

84
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>and so it turns out that when you tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>young people that they're pretty damn </v>

85
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.031
<v Speaker 1>happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I thought I </v>

86
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:48.611
<v Speaker 1>would do tonight is talk about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives might have to offer to </v>

87
00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:51.920
<v Speaker 1>young people as a saleable message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

88
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 1>because my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I've learned over the </v>

89
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was quite</v>

90
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>revealing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

91
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll start with a brief story just as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little intro to this.</v>

92
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.150
<v Speaker 1>In the last three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you may know that there was </v>

93
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.571
<v Speaker 1>quite a political storm that emerged </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly among journalists over the </v>

94
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:17.011
<v Speaker 1>issue of cultural appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A number of journalists got in real </v>

95
00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:20.761
<v Speaker 1>trouble for transgressing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically correct norms in </v>

96
00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:23.940
<v Speaker 1>relationship to cultural appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tremendously ill defined,</v>

97
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 1>and let's call it pathological concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could start with that,</v>

98
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that was so interesting </v>

99
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>and I think I probably talked to 10 of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada's top 20 journalists.</v>

100
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 1>That would be a reasonable estimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them in print,</v>

101
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:41.911
<v Speaker 1>but not all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single one of them told me that </v>

102
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>they were censoring themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you think about that man,</v>

103
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 1>that's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a country like this and these people,</v>

104
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

105
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>if anyone has power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have power.</v>

106
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

107
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:54.631
<v Speaker 1>they don't really have power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have competence and influence and </v>

108
00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:57.391
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same thing as power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bloody afraid of being hung out </v>

109
00:05:57.391 --> 00:06:00.751
<v Speaker 1>to dry if they say the wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about where our damn country </v>

110
00:06:00.751 --> 00:06:01.520
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the 10 most powerful journalists in</v>

111
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>the country are afraid to write and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they think,</v>

112
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

113
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.290
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what it is that they want </v>

114
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>to say or think the fact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only did they tell me that they were</v>

115
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:17.471
<v Speaker 1>censoring themselves and that they felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would be hung out to dry if </v>

116
00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:20.741
<v Speaker 1>they said the wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also told me that they were </v>

117
00:06:20.741 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>being censored by their editors and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.470
<v Speaker 1>in a country that has a great tradition </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a tradition that's much longer than </v>

119
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>this country has been around of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and free speech and free press.</v>

120
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.420
<v Speaker 1>For us to be in this situation now where</v>
<v Speaker 1>our major journalists are afraid that if</v>

121
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:43.421
<v Speaker 1>they misstep inappropriately in this new</v>
<v Speaker 1>found political landmine that they're </v>

122
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>going to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not good.</v>

123
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad diagnostic sign.</v>

124
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

125
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:55.451
<v Speaker 1>I said that story was a little intro to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other story was going to tell you </v>

126
00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:58.720
<v Speaker 1>and then so I've been fortunate enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last several months to meet not</v>

127
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.260
<v Speaker 1>the majority of the people who ran for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the leadership of the Federal </v>

128
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Conservative Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of them,</v>

129
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 1>including the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person who Andrew,</v>

130
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 1>who recently won and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all told me the same thing,</v>

131
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.220
<v Speaker 1>which was also interesting was that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives were afraid to be </v>

132
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 1>conservative and if for exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

133
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:23.921
<v Speaker 1>they were afraid that if they put </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward valid conservative perspectives </v>

134
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 1>that they would be isolated and mobbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and taken down and,</v>

135
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 1>and that made them censor themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be willing to speak up.</v>

136
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:38.530
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I told each of them when we </v>

137
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.571
<v Speaker 1>discussed this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing was if you guys are </v>

138
00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:40.571
<v Speaker 1>afraid to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already lost.</v>

139
00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 1>You might as well just pack up and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

140
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 1>It's done now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:45.380
<v Speaker 1>as a psychologist.</v>

142
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

143
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making a case for conservatism.</v>

144
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not here to make a political case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

145
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to make a philosophical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological case and I think that's </v>

146
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 1>what I've been doing all along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has political implications,</v>

147
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not saying that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative or that conservative is the</v>

148
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:10.961
<v Speaker 1>only way to be because I actually don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that for for a variety of </v>

149
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:14.201
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons is that I know that </v>

150
00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:18.310
<v Speaker 1>political belief is determined in large </v>
<v Speaker 1>part by temperament and personality and </v>

151
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.751
<v Speaker 1>that's very strongly biologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced and so conservatives tend to </v>

152
00:08:22.751 --> 00:08:25.811
<v Speaker 1>be lower and openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a trait associated with </v>

153
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:28.811
<v Speaker 1>creativity and hiring conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a trait associated with </v>

154
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:32.740
<v Speaker 1>industriousness and orderliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to make good managers and </v>

155
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.831
<v Speaker 1>administrators and lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to make good conservative </v>

156
00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:35.831
<v Speaker 1>business types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

157
00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:40.270
<v Speaker 1>that's their forte,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's their niche and that's a valid </v>

158
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>place to be in a valid thing to be and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 1>conservatives aren't so good at being </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial and they're not so good </v>

160
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 1>at being artistic and creative.</v>

161
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>That's not their niche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more the niche of the liberal end</v>

162
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:50.720
<v Speaker 1>of the spectrum and as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

163
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>for the political system to function </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

164
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you need proper representation for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the temperamental types and they need to</v>

165
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>be engaged in dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

166
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is is that when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatives are saying,</v>

167
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're perhaps thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about leading the damn party,</v>

169
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.780
<v Speaker 1>let's say that they're worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking their mind in a conservative </v>

170
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not a good thing.</v>

171
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:18.771
<v Speaker 1>That means that something's gone wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our political system and seriously </v>

172
00:09:18.771 --> 00:09:18.771
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

173
00:09:18.771 --> 00:09:18.771
<v Speaker 1>when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that.</v>

174
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that I've noticed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

175
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

176
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.840
<v Speaker 1>when this all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of you may know in some of you may </v>

177
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.800
<v Speaker 1>not know that I made a couple of videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>back September 27th.</v>

178
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I woke up one night because I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep and I thought,</v>

179
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.750
<v Speaker 1>are you usually going right if I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep because I've got something to </v>

180
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.750
<v Speaker 1>figure out.</v>

181
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.750
<v Speaker 1>But I've been playing with youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

182
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:42.411
<v Speaker 1>I've been putting my lectures online </v>
<v Speaker 1>since 2013 and by last April they had </v>

183
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>about a million views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>

184
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:44.080
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

185
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>that's really something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

186
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you write a book and you sell a </v>

187
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.130
<v Speaker 1>million copies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're one happy character.</v>

188
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 1>And I thought a million views is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>large number of views.</v>

189
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:59.001
<v Speaker 1>It really tuned me into the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube was something completely other </v>

190
00:09:59.001 --> 00:09:59.001
<v Speaker 1>than what I thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

191
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 1>that night I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

192
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:06.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make a video instead of writing it </v>

193
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.961
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was a video about bill </v>

194
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:08.961
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

195
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 1>the Senate just passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

196
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Half the conservatives voted for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that the justice </v>

197
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.501
<v Speaker 1>minister was presented with an amendment</v>
<v Speaker 1>that clearly indicated that bill see 16 </v>

198
00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>would not infringe upon free speech and </v>
<v Speaker 1>refused to consider the amendment.</v>

199
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's compelled speech is now.</v>

200
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:31.131
<v Speaker 1>The law in Canada isn't yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be very soon and half </v>

201
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives voted for that damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill.</v>

202
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:35.240
<v Speaker 1>people have gotten after me for being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.250
<v Speaker 1>anti transgender and bigoted and phobic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that nonsense that the left </v>

205
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Speaker 1>tends to hurl at people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the case.</v>

206
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:47.121
<v Speaker 1>I read that damn legislation and I read </v>
<v Speaker 1>the policies surrounding it and I knew </v>

207
00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well that the way it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulated right now,</v>

208
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:52.860
<v Speaker 1>it will do more harm to the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>purports to protect then good.</v>

209
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:58.010
<v Speaker 1>That'll take about 10 years to unfold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so incoherent and the the the </v>

210
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>principles upon which that legislation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's surrounding policies are based,</v>

211
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:07.941
<v Speaker 1>are so paradoxical and contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they will act themselves out </v>

212
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:12.320
<v Speaker 1>because that's what happens with </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradoxical beliefs and tangled people </v>

213
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.591
<v Speaker 1>up like the men that tight tangle people</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in them like mad and we'll see that </v>

214
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:21.711
<v Speaker 1>happen over the next decade and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because the people who put bill </v>

215
00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Speaker 1>60 [inaudible] forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to its </v>

216
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Speaker 1>surrounding policies.</v>

217
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.870
<v Speaker 1>The ones that are detailed out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Commission website </v>

218
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 1>don't give a damn about transgendered </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

219
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:35.541
<v Speaker 1>As far as I'm concerned there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another agenda at work that's </v>

220
00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 1>driving their entire political force </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and the transgender types.</v>

221
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:39.390
<v Speaker 1>We're just flavor of the month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

222
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:44.391
<v Speaker 1>They were poster boys for moving this </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern agenda forward and so the </v>

223
00:11:44.391 --> 00:11:48.951
<v Speaker 1>fact that the legislation isn't going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do them any good during the </v>

224
00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:52.791
<v Speaker 1>transgendered people any good isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to stop the people who put the </v>

225
00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:52.791
<v Speaker 1>legislation forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

226
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I made these videos and I put them on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on youtube and well to say that they </v>

227
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 1>caused a storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is somewhat of an understatement.</v>

228
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

229
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what to think about.</v>

230
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.050
<v Speaker 1>It's completely and absolutely surreal </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

231
00:12:09.051 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 1>what's happened to me like as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that,</v>

232
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know how many people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched those original videos,</v>

233
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 1>like $350,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think now about 50 million people have</v>

234
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:23.680
<v Speaker 1>watched videos associated with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of events that I'm describing,</v>

235
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:28.681
<v Speaker 1>which is just 350,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people watched the testimony that I gave</v>

236
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:33.400
<v Speaker 1>before the Senate on bill [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bloody well know that the apocalypse</v>

237
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 1>is close when 350,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around the world watch a Canadian</v>

238
00:12:37.991 --> 00:12:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Senate hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I really,</v>

239
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean really what's going on man?</v>

240
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.220
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:50.970
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:55.971
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the journalists are nervous and </v>

243
00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:55.971
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

244
00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:55.971
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part where they're conservatives are</v>

245
00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:57.830
<v Speaker 1>nervous and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

246
00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:58.860
<v Speaker 1>well then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:03.861
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I put myself out and made these </v>

248
00:13:03.861 --> 00:13:06.801
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are really didn't expect to </v>

249
00:13:06.801 --> 00:13:08.751
<v Speaker 1>attract much attention at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just assumed that I was going to </v>

250
00:13:08.751 --> 00:13:08.751
<v Speaker 1>clarify what I was thinking a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

251
00:13:08.751 --> 00:13:13.020
<v Speaker 1>to see what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of a curious person now that'll </v>

252
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.770
<v Speaker 1>teach me but I'm kind of a curious </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

253
00:13:13.771 --> 00:13:15.360
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

254
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.200
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:13:16.201 --> 00:13:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I also experienced firsthand what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when you do something like that.</v>

256
00:13:19.171 --> 00:13:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Now I got nailed right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got especially for about three months,</v>

257
00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:28.431
<v Speaker 1>things were pretty up in the air at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university sent me two letters telling </v>

258
00:13:28.431 --> 00:13:30.390
<v Speaker 1>me that it was so funny because I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>made this video and I said,</v>

259
00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under this new legislation,</v>

260
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.090
<v Speaker 1>making this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing this legislation is probably</v>

261
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:36.720
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

262
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:42.050
<v Speaker 1>And so then the unit and people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course reacted to me as if I was </v>

263
00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.230
<v Speaker 1>scaremongering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way was the right response.</v>

264
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:46.230
<v Speaker 1>When you hear someone in a stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>society stand up and say,</v>

265
00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:48.050
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

266
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.070
<v Speaker 1>there's something rotten at the base </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

267
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's affecting the manner in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the legislation that our country is </v>

268
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.190
<v Speaker 1>producing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

269
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.480
<v Speaker 1>is being rolled fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they say that you should think that</v>

270
00:13:57.481 --> 00:14:01.110
<v Speaker 1>person is probably a charlatan and has </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with them because look,</v>

271
00:14:01.111 --> 00:14:06.111
<v Speaker 1>the culture works pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The has worked really well for a long </v>

272
00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:08.811
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the logical initial response </v>

273
00:14:08.811 --> 00:14:08.811
<v Speaker 1>should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

274
00:14:08.811 --> 00:14:12.621
<v Speaker 1>you think there's a fundamental problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why shouldn't we just assume that </v>

275
00:14:12.621 --> 00:14:15.231
<v Speaker 1>there's a fundamental problem with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways that you determined </v>

276
00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:19.341
<v Speaker 1>that is you throw things out the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically and see if any of them </v>

277
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:19.341
<v Speaker 1>stick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:20.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

279
00:14:20.011 --> 00:14:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I was a big homophobic and transphobic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a racist.</v>

280
00:14:23.911 --> 00:14:28.911
<v Speaker 1>That one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the hell that one </v>

281
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:28.911
<v Speaker 1>came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was because I,</v>

282
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:28.911
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I criticize the two.</v>

283
00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call reprehensible women </v>

284
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.830
<v Speaker 1>who started black lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter movement,</v>

285
00:14:34.831 --> 00:14:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't because they're black.</v>

286
00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:38.520
<v Speaker 1>It's because they're reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black or white.</v>

287
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're reprehensible,</v>

288
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:45.170
<v Speaker 1>your reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the definition of not </v>

289
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.170
<v Speaker 1>being racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

290
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.170
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

291
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

292
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there were a couple of demonstrations</v>

293
00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 1>and then the press jumped on me to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

294
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do too bad a job I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think and then the university thankfully</v>

295
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:08.921
<v Speaker 1>wrote two letters saying that what I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing was probably illegal and that it </v>

296
00:15:08.921 --> 00:15:12.731
<v Speaker 1>violated the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ontario Human Rights Commission's </v>

297
00:15:12.731 --> 00:15:15.971
<v Speaker 1>policies and probably the university's </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies as well as far as they were </v>

298
00:15:15.971 --> 00:15:19.571
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really wasn't the case and the </v>

299
00:15:19.571 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 1>letters also contained a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>untruths which I detailed because I read</v>

300
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:25.331
<v Speaker 1>them on Youtube too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually quite helpful and </v>

301
00:15:25.331 --> 00:15:28.391
<v Speaker 1>handy that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone writes me a letter that </v>

302
00:15:28.391 --> 00:15:30.890
<v Speaker 1>purports to lay out a set of facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can just read it.</v>

303
00:15:30.891 --> 00:15:35.891
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have to comment on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can read it and let people make up </v>

304
00:15:35.891 --> 00:15:35.891
<v Speaker 1>their own minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they did so,</v>

305
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.430
<v Speaker 1>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my job was in,</v>

306
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.330
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

307
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 1>in doubt.</v>

308
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.300
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that the university went </v>
<v Speaker 1>after me actually turned out to be </v>

309
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:46.300
<v Speaker 1>extremely helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

310
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.051
<v Speaker 1>Because I had said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look under the provisions of this new </v>

311
00:15:50.051 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 1>legislation and legislation like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's already in place in Canada,</v>

312
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 1>what I am doing criticizing this bill is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably illegal.</v>

313
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 1>And everyone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

314
00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:58.330
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're,</v>

315
00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a,</v>

316
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.280
<v Speaker 1>you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a scaremonger.</v>

317
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:06.281
<v Speaker 1>And a rabble rouser and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the university wrote a letter </v>

318
00:16:06.281 --> 00:16:07.640
<v Speaker 1>saying what you did violated the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

319
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.820
<v Speaker 1>the university policy and probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ontario Human Rights Commission's </v>

320
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:12.820
<v Speaker 1>policies and the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

321
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.810
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had your lawyers take a look at it.</v>

322
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.420
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have asked for a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger statement,</v>

323
00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 1>a stronger statement in support of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I had said,</v>

324
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.600
<v Speaker 1>especially because it certainly wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>written in support of what I had set.</v>

325
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.960
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the journalist started to pay </v>

326
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:28.960
<v Speaker 1>attention to what I had actually looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>at and they read it and they thought,</v>

327
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

328
00:16:30.011 --> 00:16:35.011
<v Speaker 1>That don't that ordinary human rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>commission website policy mass is </v>

329
00:16:35.011 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 1>actually quite a nest of spiders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like he said.</v>
