1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.510
<v Speaker 1>People ask what the meaning of life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that meaning is </v>

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.980
<v Speaker 1>proportionate to the adoption of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say you have a little sister </v>

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>who's like three,</v>

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.140
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take care of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like questioning whether that's a good </v>

6
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>idea just seemed stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

7
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:28.310
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't seem like the right kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of question.</v>

8
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:33.311
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well obviously self evidently let's say </v>

9
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.980
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do and you find it </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>

10
00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 1>interacting with a little kid when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

12
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>when I had little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>when they were like two or under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took them out to see their relatives </v>

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>and they were older people and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they watched that two year old like,</v>

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.890
<v Speaker 1>like it was a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>every second that that little kid was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room,</v>

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>every single adult was focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on,</v>

18
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>on him or her.</v>

19
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 1>That's something that people attended to</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a source of meaning.</v>

21
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:13.870
<v Speaker 1>And what else is a meaningful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>your family relationships are meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you and maybe the responsibility that</v>

23
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>you adopt as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a friend that,</v>

24
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:26.741
<v Speaker 1>that seems meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your decision to pursue a </v>

25
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>particular career and be of some utility</v>
<v Speaker 1>in society,</v>

26
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that's governed by your desire </v>

27
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>to establish some security and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

28
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:39.191
<v Speaker 1>It's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also playing an integral role</v>

29
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:43.490
<v Speaker 1>in the maintenance of the structure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>supports you.</v>

30
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:48.491
<v Speaker 1>And my observation has been that in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice is that people just </v>

31
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>have a hell of a time if they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

32
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.360
<v Speaker 1>if they don't slot in somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think I got to go to work at nine in</v>

34
00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>the morning and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this rigid schedule.</v>

35
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

36
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a good idea to be grateful</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that because of.</v>

37
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:07.401
<v Speaker 1>What I have noticed is that if people </v>
<v Speaker 1>pull out from those externally </v>

38
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>scaffolded systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they drift,</v>

39
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.880
<v Speaker 1>they get depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get anxious,</v>

40
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

41
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kinda like sled dogs with no </v>

42
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>slab and we're kinda like sled dogs as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell.</v>

43
00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Beasts of burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we need a load,</v>

44
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a load,</v>

45
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.470
<v Speaker 1>and the question is what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of low do you need?</v>

46
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.920
<v Speaker 1>And here's why I think we need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need that.</v>

47
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

48
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about how to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what's real for a long time and </v>

49
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 1>because I'm an existentialist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm operating under the presupposition </v>

50
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>that you can tell what people believe by</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching what they,</v>

51
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>how they act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what they say,</v>

52
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what their statements are </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their view of reality because the </v>

53
00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:02.471
<v Speaker 1>correlation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between that and their </v>

54
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.501
<v Speaker 1>actual actions is not certainly not </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect and sometimes it doesn't even </v>

55
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I've noticed is that people,</v>

56
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.960
<v Speaker 1>no one argues with their own pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who hurts acts as if they </v>

57
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>believe that pain is real.</v>

58
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>So we could say the ultimate reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

59
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.370
<v Speaker 1>That's how people act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in keeping with the claims of many </v>

60
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>religious traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>the Jews are always recollecting past </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

62
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Christian God is crucified </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

63
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a fair bit of pain there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Buddhists.</v>

64
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental maximum is that life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

65
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that there's a </v>

66
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.361
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical claim there no metaphysical</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim is that pain is real.</v>

67
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it depends on what you mean by</v>

68
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:08.060
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people act as if their pain is real.</v>

69
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good place to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that poses a problem.</v>

70
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Life is a pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is suffering,</v>

71
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.020
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

72
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you can be broken,</v>

73
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>hurt and destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems pretty self evident </v>

74
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.950
<v Speaker 1>and worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>

75
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And that makes people unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's our selfconsciousness,</v>

76
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what separates us in some </v>

77
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.941
<v Speaker 1>sense from other creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean other creatures have some self </v>

78
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:55.991
<v Speaker 1>consciousness like a chimp can learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize itself and a mirror and </v>

79
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:57.200
<v Speaker 1>soaking a dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

80
00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty bare bones,</v>

81
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.770
<v Speaker 1>selfconsciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>real self consciousness is the knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your borders and not only in space </v>

83
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 1>but in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>

84
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.570
<v Speaker 1>human beings are the only creatures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have discovered the future.</v>

85
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's really good because we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan for the future,</v>

86
00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:22.211
<v Speaker 1>but it's really bad because you know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future is finite and that's like that's </v>

87
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>a big shock to the old system and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existential burden that everyone </v>

88
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:32.280
<v Speaker 1>bears and its associated integrity with </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

89
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.230
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

90
00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:37.590
<v Speaker 1>life is suffering and it's finite and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the suffering.</v>

91
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.480
<v Speaker 1>That's part of what you makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>question the value of existing and maybe</v>

92
00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:44.640
<v Speaker 1>the value of existence itself.</v>

93
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.730
<v Speaker 1>So then what do you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were used as a weapon against that?</v>

94
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:52.820
<v Speaker 1>we talked a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

96
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Now it seems to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of responsibility that you </v>

98
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.360
<v Speaker 1>adopt</v>

99
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.250
<v Speaker 1>with really in relationship to things </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to increase your meaningful </v>

100
00:06:09.191 --> 00:06:10.390
<v Speaker 1>engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

101
00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:15.100
<v Speaker 1>well what's the most meaningfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged activity?</v>

102
00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:20.101
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how about little reduction in the </v>

103
00:06:20.101 --> 00:06:21.610
<v Speaker 1>old suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

104
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.680
<v Speaker 1>So you live your life so that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing undue pain,</v>

105
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.320
<v Speaker 1>especially pointless pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>

106
00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:31.780
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you could even be more useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

107
00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:35.680
<v Speaker 1>And you could figure out some ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>some suffering years,</v>

108
00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:40.681
<v Speaker 1>other people's both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're really hitting a home run,</v>

109
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can figure out some way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that can be rectified and that </v>

110
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.480
<v Speaker 1>seems to be meaningful in and of itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

111
00:06:49.481 --> 00:06:52.180
<v Speaker 1>if it's pain that makes you doubt the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of life,</v>

112
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:57.181
<v Speaker 1>which is perfectly reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the cessation of pain,</v>

113
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.970
<v Speaker 1>the cessation of suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minimization of suffering as a </v>

114
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>logical corollary should be the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

115
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.210
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some mode that you can conduct </v>

116
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>yourself in that makes you a good person</v>

117
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

118
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>part of being a good person is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>alleviate suffering.</v>

119
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:26.950
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

120
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you get to question that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

121
00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:34.260
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the suffering itself is what's making</v>

122
00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:39.261
<v Speaker 1>you question the validity of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can't also say that the </v>

123
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:42.630
<v Speaker 1>cessation of that is not useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can,</v>

124
00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:44.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's completely incoherent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

125
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 1>You can claim incoherent things if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

126
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.210
<v Speaker 1>So then I would say these distilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that I'm talking about,</v>

127
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.670
<v Speaker 1>the stories that are written by great </v>
<v Speaker 1>authors,</v>

128
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm particularly fond of Dostoevsky </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose,</v>

129
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>whose works are he's head and shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 1>above anyone I've ever read in terms of</v>

130
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.530
<v Speaker 1>writers of fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He deals with the hardest questions that</v>

131
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:26.531
<v Speaker 1>human beings face and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has characters on both sides of the </v>

132
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 1>argument and there they really lay out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arguments.</v>

133
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:36.071
<v Speaker 1>It's not like Dostoevsky and all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has got a belief and so he has a </v>

134
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:37.010
<v Speaker 1>character and that character has his </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs.</v>

135
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:39.040
<v Speaker 1>And that character always wins the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>

136
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 1>It's that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Dostoyevsky novel at all,</v>

137
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.540
<v Speaker 1>he sets up a character and then he sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>up like three or four antagonists and </v>

138
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.470
<v Speaker 1>those antagonists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not straw men,</v>

139
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 1>they're like iron giants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just stomp his,</v>

140
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>his protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

141
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:57.200
<v Speaker 1>And the whole thing is a war between </v>
<v Speaker 1>these different conceptions of being.</v>

142
00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to read.</v>

143
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

144
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.730
<v Speaker 1>so you distill these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great authors distill stories,</v>

145
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 1>great storytellers distill stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have stories that are very,</v>

146
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

147
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 1>very old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are usually religious stories.</v>

148
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Of one form or another particular be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairy tales because fairy tales,</v>

149
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>some people have traced fairytales back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

150
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.040
<v Speaker 1>more than 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and so they're part of an oral </v>

151
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.711
<v Speaker 1>tradition and oral traditions can last </v>
<v Speaker 1>for tens of thousands of years and you </v>

152
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.650
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a story that's been told for 10,000</v>

153
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>years is a funny kind of story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people have remembered it and,</v>

154
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:45.210
<v Speaker 1>and obviously modified it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the game of telephone,</v>

155
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:50.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I tell you something and you </v>

156
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:50.211
<v Speaker 1>whispered to the person next to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

157
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like a game of telephone that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone on for you know,</v>

158
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 1>thousand generations and all that's left</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what people remember and maybe they </v>

159
00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:03.771
<v Speaker 1>remember what's important because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to remember what's important and </v>

160
00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 1>didn't necessarily the case that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

161
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>what the hell it means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what music means,</v>

162
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.590
<v Speaker 1>but you know that's a stop you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to it.</v>

163
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

164
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>what a movie that you see or a book that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read means not.</v>

165
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:21.651
<v Speaker 1>If it's profound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means more than you can understand </v>

166
00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise why read it.</v>
