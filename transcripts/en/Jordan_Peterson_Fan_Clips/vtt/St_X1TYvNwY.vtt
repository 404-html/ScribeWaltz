1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say that's worth more than money </v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.921
<v Speaker 1>and that's worth more than money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know lots of people who have lots of </v>

3
00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>money and let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money protects you,</v>

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.730
<v Speaker 1>your as well protected from the world by</v>
<v Speaker 1>money right now as you ever will be for </v>

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.571
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your life because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of life's fundamental problems </v>

6
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>can't be solved with money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>like rich people get divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have affairs,</v>

8
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:26.481
<v Speaker 1>their children get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have all the problems you </v>

9
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:26.481
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly because you're already</v>

10
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>rich and so</v>

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>you might think that if you had a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of more money,</v>

12
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>things would be better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not true.</v>

13
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:39.501
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways that they might be worse </v>

14
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>because money can open up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can open up the possibility of all sorts</v>

15
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>of temptations to you that you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't afford at the moment.</v>

16
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>So well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like economic economics,</v>

17
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>we've already solved that problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally and we're rapidly solving </v>

18
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>it everywhere in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world economy is growing so damn </v>

20
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>fast that you can't even imagine how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could possibly make it grow any faster.</v>

21
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:05.061
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've lifted hundreds of millions of </v>

22
00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>people out of poverty in the last 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

23
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UN set a goal by 2015,</v>

24
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it was to cut poverty by half if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember correctly.</v>

25
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>And they reached two years early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

26
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unbelievable.</v>

27
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

28
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I started to try to understand </v>

29
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.270
<v Speaker 1>what it might be to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live and,</v>

30
00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:33.271
<v Speaker 1>and really what I was looking forward to</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not so much to live a life that was </v>

31
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:36.631
<v Speaker 1>wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least to live a life that wasn't </v>

32
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>pathologically unwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought of the sorts of things </v>

33
00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:44.341
<v Speaker 1>that people were doing to one another in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Auschwitz camps and in the Gulag </v>

34
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:47.320
<v Speaker 1>archipelago and all of that horror that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was perpetrated on,</v>

35
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.540
<v Speaker 1>on people as definitely unwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever else you might say about it was</v>

36
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:53.980
<v Speaker 1>unwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I thought,</v>

37
00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:56.800
<v Speaker 1>well maybe there's a way to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you could not do that.</v>

38
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>And so that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's my sense is that</v>

39
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 1>when you come to university to learn how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a civilized person,</v>

40
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 1>which is what supposed to happen at </v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

41
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it's just a trade school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might as well go to trade school as </v>

42
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.930
<v Speaker 1>far as I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to learn something that will</v>

43
00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:21.931
<v Speaker 1>get you a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a lot faster and it's </v>

44
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:24.190
<v Speaker 1>more certain and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's useful.</v>

45
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.490
<v Speaker 1>If you're not being taught to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen at university,</v>

46
00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:27.850
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

47
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>why bother with it so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

48
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

49
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of that cloud of </v>

50
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>mythological fantasy that surrounds our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

51
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>That's part of its deep history that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to,</v>

52
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you grapple with the humanities and </v>

53
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>with art and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're trying to,</v>

54
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to master and incorporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

55
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.670
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pull into you so that you're </v>

56
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.810
<v Speaker 1>situated properly in history and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not just floating in the void</v>

57
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

58
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:06.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tiny individuality that's divorced </v>

59
00:03:06.211 --> 00:03:08.460
<v Speaker 1>from everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're weak and that circumstance.</v>

60
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

61
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>that's more of an explanation of why I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to puzzle through these things </v>

62
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.110
<v Speaker 1>and trying to puzzle through them with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

63
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.720
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this,</v>

64
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.350
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this song last week and you know,</v>

65
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a hypothesis to you.</v>

66
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.970
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go through this quickly.</v>

67
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.720
<v Speaker 1>It's Doggerel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not great poetry,</v>

68
00:03:35.721 --> 00:03:39.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very popular song.</v>

69
00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:44.381
<v Speaker 1>It's quite beautiful in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually sung by like a heavenly </v>

70
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:44.450
<v Speaker 1>choir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it sounds like.</v>

71
00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:48.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's got this cathedral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine people singing it in a</v>

72
00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:50.990
<v Speaker 1>cathedral essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not accidental.</v>

73
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It's purposeful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:53.180
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

75
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.230
<v Speaker 1>it partakes of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

76
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.140
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it partakes of that aesthetic,</v>

77
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.280
<v Speaker 1>that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

78
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.560
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the filmmakers are,</v>

79
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>are implying that what is about to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>shown to you has this divine element </v>

80
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that's signified by the choir </v>

81
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.510
<v Speaker 1>of voices that sings this song.</v>

82
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 1>And the song says fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this is that if you lift </v>

83
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.450
<v Speaker 1>up your eyes above the temporal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the transcendent,</v>

84
00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:34.451
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what exists in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavenly world in the stars.</v>

85
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.530
<v Speaker 1>If you pick a an ultimate goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you pick the right ultimate goal,</v>

86
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.070
<v Speaker 1>then and you know anyone can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

87
00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It's democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

88
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.080
<v Speaker 1>it's anyone can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

89
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.680
<v Speaker 1>that's the second proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter who you are,</v>

90
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 1>you can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think that's a reflection of </v>

91
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.110
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the divinity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

92
00:04:54.111 --> 00:04:57.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's something about each </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual that's valuable regardless of</v>

93
00:04:57.921 --> 00:05:02.390
<v Speaker 1>their idiosyncrasies and so they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this potential that they can manifest.</v>

94
00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:03.650
<v Speaker 1>And how do you manifest it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.200
<v Speaker 1>you pick the right goal and what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right goal?</v>

96
00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

97
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.690
<v Speaker 1>it's high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's elevated,</v>

98
00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:10.310
<v Speaker 1>it's above the mundane.</v>

99
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Now what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

100
00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:13.880
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know.</v>

101
00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:18.110
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's signified by a star and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a star is something that glimmers in the</v>

102
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.470
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

103
00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:20.600
<v Speaker 1>So it's a source of light in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>

104
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a metaphor there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's a metaphor there and </v>

105
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.030
<v Speaker 1>the star is the star that the star of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood,</v>

106
00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:34.031
<v Speaker 1>you know the person that you emulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it because it's an ideal </v>

107
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>is it's going to be a human ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort that you're aiming at and so </v>

108
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.950
<v Speaker 1>the ideal human being is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the star that you're aiming at?</v>

109
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's what you're aiming at,</v>

110
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.880
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 1>what should you aim at in life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wanting to answer as well,</v>

112
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 1>why don't you aim at being whatever you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>

113
00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>That would be the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

114
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what that is exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because how do you,</v>

115
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could think,</v>

116
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>well that would be really good if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have it.</v>

117
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

118
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>can I think of anything better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

119
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then well why not go for that?</v>

120
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

121
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>well it's too ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes too much responsibility.</v>

122
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

123
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:13.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

124
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.210
<v Speaker 1>those are definitely problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I've figured </v>

125
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>out over the years is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>offered the person the opportunity,</v>

126
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people say,</v>

127
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:26.411
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life doesn't really have any ultimate </v>

128
00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:26.411
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

129
00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:26.411
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

130
00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:26.640
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>

131
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.870
<v Speaker 1>let's say it has an ultimate meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that in order to experience that </v>

132
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:37.991
<v Speaker 1>ultimate meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take on ultimate </v>

133
00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

134
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>that's a heavy price to pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a meaningful life,</v>

135
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>

136
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no damn way I'm going to do </v>

137
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.740
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go for the,</v>

138
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointless.</v>

139
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

140
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll go for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trivial pointless perspective,</v>

141
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.050
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was kind of hard on me existentially,</v>

142
00:06:56.051 --> 00:06:58.810
<v Speaker 1>but it frees me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do whatever the hell I want moment</v>

143
00:06:58.811 --> 00:07:03.811
<v Speaker 1>to moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any ultimate </v>

144
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:03.811
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think,</v>

145
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:05.050
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of a good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then then.</v>

146
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:07.360
<v Speaker 1>But that raises this weird specter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt,</v>

147
00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:11.110
<v Speaker 1>which is why when you hear people talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the ultimate futility of life,</v>

148
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.440
<v Speaker 1>is it because life is ultimately futile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it because they've decided that </v>

149
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.510
<v Speaker 1>they would just assume not adopt the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and they use that real </v>

150
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:26.521
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to not adopt the </v>

151
00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:28.111
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They rationalize that by proposing that </v>

152
00:07:28.111 --> 00:07:30.670
<v Speaker 1>life is ultimately meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless and like,</v>

153
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of by that I really do think </v>

154
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.120
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going on so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not,</v>

155
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.500
<v Speaker 1>but it could be that if you want to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ultimately meaningful life that you </v>

156
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.150
<v Speaker 1>have to adopt ultimate responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

157
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.610
<v Speaker 1>What might that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

158
00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 1>one thing it might mean is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do think it means this is it.</v>

159
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Alexander Pope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I might be wrong about that.</v>

160
00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Who said nothing human is foreign to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a hell of a statement,</v>

161
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:08.371
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you think about all the </v>

162
00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:09.280
<v Speaker 1>things that human beings are capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're capable of some,</v>

163
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.370
<v Speaker 1>like if you really want to know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are capable of,</v>

164
00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:14.920
<v Speaker 1>you should read about read about unit </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven slash 31,</v>

165
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.410
<v Speaker 1>but I would not recommend it because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you read it,</v>

166
00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:20.290
<v Speaker 1>you will never forget it and you will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry that you read it,</v>

167
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.040
<v Speaker 1>but you'll know anyways to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing human is foreign to you.</v>

168
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:32.131
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a thing to say because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that what other people have </v>

169
00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:36.181
<v Speaker 1>done you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that also means you need to take </v>

170
00:08:36.181 --> 00:08:38.350
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no joke.</v>

171
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal to do that and even </v>

172
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.790
<v Speaker 1>trivial manner anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the idea is that you can elevate.</v>

173
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:50.050
<v Speaker 1>If you elevate your viewpoint to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcendent ethic,</v>

174
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.140
<v Speaker 1>you want what's ultimately good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really want that.</v>

175
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that is you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what you're even out says </v>

176
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:03.261
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then it says this strange thing </v>

177
00:09:03.261 --> 00:09:03.261
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

178
00:09:03.261 --> 00:09:03.261
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll all of a sudden come to you.</v>

179
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a proposition and it's the </v>

180
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:08.360
<v Speaker 1>proposition that's basically played out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movie.</v>

181
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypothesis is the best way to Orient</v>

182
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:15.921
<v Speaker 1>yourself in life is to orient yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the highest good that you're </v>

183
00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:19.131
<v Speaker 1>capable of imagining and then aim at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and then things will work out the </v>

184
00:09:19.131 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 1>best way they can for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

185
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

186
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.480
<v Speaker 1>my observation of life has led me to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that seems to be correct.</v>

187
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get something you don't aim at</v>

188
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.500
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't work out and so lots </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people are not thinking that's what </v>

189
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:36.500
<v Speaker 1>they get.</v>

190
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you aim at something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a reasonable crack at getting </v>

191
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.160
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.330
<v Speaker 1>you tend to change what you're aiming at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bed along the way because like what </v>

193
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:44.330
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:44.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>game there,</v>

195
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get a little closer and then the</v>

196
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:50.571
<v Speaker 1>aim there and you're still wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a little closer and the aim </v>

197
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:53.451
<v Speaker 1>there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you move towards what you're aiming </v>

198
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:53.451
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

199
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>your characterization of what to aim at </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes more and more sophisticated.</v>

200
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't really matter if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong to begin with,</v>

201
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:04.461
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're smart enough to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the way and as long as you specify a </v>

202
00:10:04.461 --> 00:10:08.211
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I specify a vague what I want things </v>

203
00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 1>to be the best they could be and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to learn what best means as I go</v>

204
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

205
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:16.071
<v Speaker 1>So fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get what you truly need </v>

206
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:16.071
<v Speaker 1>will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

207
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
