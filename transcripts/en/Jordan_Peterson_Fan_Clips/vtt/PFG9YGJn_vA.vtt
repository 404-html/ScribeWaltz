1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>The basic narrative of human struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his oppressor versus oppressed,</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>we use category structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can constrain that infinite number of </v>

3
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.911
<v Speaker 1>interpretations because the basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative is an oppressor versus </v>

4
00:00:13.911 --> 00:00:17.841
<v Speaker 1>oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We choose those narratives that serve </v>

5
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>our function as old pressers,</v>

6
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>so it's deeply cynical but credible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:33.051
<v Speaker 1>and you can say if you're not naive that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are motivated by power and that </v>

8
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>our interpretations of the world can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>self serving.</v>

9
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do want to serve ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>after all because otherwise we die and </v>

10
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.131
<v Speaker 1>so and we are centered in one place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can't see everything and we're </v>

11
00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>biased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

12
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So there is the probability that the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we look at the world will be </v>

13
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.911
<v Speaker 1>tainted by narrow self interest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even tainted by ingroup interests </v>

14
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.800
<v Speaker 1>beyond narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual self interested.</v>

15
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>We know this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not all bad.</v>

16
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:11.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we a good person takes care of his </v>

17
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:11.531
<v Speaker 1>or her family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

18
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>It means you prefer your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Outsiders,</v>

19
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you were going to get rid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of prejudice.</v>

20
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Like it really is like your choice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual partners,</v>

21
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.140
<v Speaker 1>a form of prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it should be distributed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an egalitarianism manner.</v>

23
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a lot funnier if it isn't </v>

24
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:35.800
<v Speaker 1>a possibility like in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

25
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

26
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.850
<v Speaker 1>in Huxley's brave new world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the rule you,</v>

27
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>you shared yourself with whoever asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was rude not to and you know </v>

28
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.010
<v Speaker 1>what it is actually rude not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's seriously rude.</v>

29
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that something you want to take away </v>

30
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.691
<v Speaker 1>from people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want that to be distributed in an </v>

31
00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:55.691
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism fashion.</v>

32
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>How prejudiced you when you choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone to sleep with you choose that </v>

33
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>person and not everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the ultimate in prejudice.</v>

34
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.590
<v Speaker 1>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

35
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.150
<v Speaker 1>that's not prejudicial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

36
00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:12.151
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually go for the most attractive </v>

37
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 1>partner you can find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually go for the healthiest partner.</v>

38
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>You go for the best person you can find </v>
<v Speaker 1>who can tolerate you.</v>

39
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 1>It's prejudicial in every possible way </v>
<v Speaker 1>so well,</v>

40
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 1>so okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your self serving and you construct a</v>

41
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:33.001
<v Speaker 1>view of the world that serves those </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfserving causes and some of that has </v>

42
00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 1>to do with power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

43
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it all has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>power</v>

44
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

45
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>It means that some of it has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

46
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are kind of racist or maybe </v>

47
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>people prefer their ingroup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy.</v>

48
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe people prefer the familiar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the novel.</v>

49
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>You know that I eat that the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists have come up with implicit</v>

50
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>association test that measures </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious bias.</v>

51
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.640
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the hell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures the people who invented that </v>

52
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.640
<v Speaker 1>bloody thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know.</v>

53
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what it measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know it's not reliable.</v>

54
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.500
<v Speaker 1>They know it's not valid enough to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>used as an individual diagnostic </v>

55
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's technically the case.</v>

56
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.910
<v Speaker 1>They also know that you can't train </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out of their unconscious biases </v>

57
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>because there is not much difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between unconscious bias and </v>

58
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>instantaneous perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really care.</v>

59
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written to Missouri and Banerji.</v>

60
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the inventors of the IAT </v>
<v Speaker 1>several times saying,</v>

61
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>how about you come out in public and say</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you already know?</v>

62
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Which is that people are misusing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn test.</v>

63
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:48.031
<v Speaker 1>that's partly because her discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social psychology is a corrupt </v>

65
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:51.061
<v Speaker 1>discipline as the social psychologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>have discovered over the last four </v>

66
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be turning themselves inside out,</v>

67
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>trying to rectify which they haven't</v>

68
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.670
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>

69
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160
<v Speaker 1>we're giving the devil his due.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an infinite number of </v>

70
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.131
<v Speaker 1>interpretations of the world and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly probable that you'll lay a self </v>

71
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>serving one on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

72
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>and also that will serve the interests </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your group,</v>

73
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>however you define that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

74
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 1>but it only accounts for a fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior.</v>

75
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of other things at </v>
<v Speaker 1>work as well,</v>

76
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and you don't get to reduce all human </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations to one motivation power,</v>

77
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>and then you might also ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:26.011
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to reduce all human </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations to power it so you can use </v>

79
00:04:26.011 --> 00:04:30.090
<v Speaker 1>power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can justify the use of </v>

80
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's force.</v>

81
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to engage in civilized </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

82
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to give a damn about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>

83
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're not a postmodernist</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't believe in facts </v>

84
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might ask,</v>

85
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you?</v>

86
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

87
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Postmodernists don't believe in facts.</v>

88
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.430
<v Speaker 1>They believe that the idea of fact is </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the power game that's placed </v>

89
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>played by the white dominated male </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy to impose the theoretical </v>

90
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>structure of the Patriarchy on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressors.</v>

91
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm not making this stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's embedded,</v>

92
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In theory,</v>

93
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:08.041
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is read it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>find this out so they don't believe in </v>

94
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:12.841
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While facts would constrain the use of </v>

95
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least that's how it looks to me.</v>

96
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

97
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:21.321
<v Speaker 1>We gave the devil his due.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an infinite number of </v>

98
00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:23.601
<v Speaker 1>interpretations and you're likely to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>bias compression algorithms on the world</v>

99
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 1>and they're likely to be biased in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>favor.</v>

100
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.680
<v Speaker 1>True,</v>

101
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

102
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.650
<v Speaker 1>only partly true.</v>

103
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.200
<v Speaker 1>And the difference between India log and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thinker is that a thinker knows the </v>

104
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.491
<v Speaker 1>difference between things that are only </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly true and things that are </v>

105
00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:48.420
<v Speaker 1>completely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are complicated.</v>

106
00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Like I like to think everything is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated as a military helicopter.</v>

107
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>You have to like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's eight hours of maintenance </v>

108
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>to keep those things in the air for one </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't fly there rocks.</v>

109
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>They plummet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to keep them in the air</v>

110
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>and they're full of parts and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know all those parts,</v>

111
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't go in there and monkey about </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them because they just wreck it and</v>

112
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.280
<v Speaker 1>that's just a helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything is way more complicated </v>

113
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>than the helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you don't just go muck about in there</v>

114
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 1>hoping you're going to make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how it works.</v>

115
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.260
<v Speaker 1>You need to be competent.</v>

116
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so look,</v>

117
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 1>here's where the postmodernists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

118
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I think there's three places and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious errors.</v>

119
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>The first is that there is an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of interpretations,</v>

120
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:36.310
<v Speaker 1>but there is not an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>viable interpretation.</v>

121
00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>So there's a very finite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>viable interpretations and I don't think</v>

122
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>that this is theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that game theorists have already</v>

123
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:48.521
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated this to some degree and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be built into AI systems </v>

124
00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:48.521
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

125
00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 1>So what are the constraints?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

126
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:55.421
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have an interpretation that </v>

127
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>leads to immediately to your death or </v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad.</v>

128
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be dead,</v>

129
00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't want to be,</v>

130
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 1>then you got a lot of limited options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

131
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to run naked across an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight lane freeway at night blindfolded </v>

132
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 1>because probably you'll be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad interpretation.</v>

133
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might say because you're fragile </v>

134
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.191
<v Speaker 1>and vulnerable and mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a limited number of ways </v>

135
00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>that you can look at the world that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't result in,</v>

136
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>let's say death or serious damage or </v>
<v Speaker 1>agony.</v>

137
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.270
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agony is a bad thing.</v>

138
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:31.271
<v Speaker 1>Most people agreed on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're constrained by pain and </v>

139
00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:34.781
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least your interpretations are </v>

140
00:07:34.781 --> 00:07:38.111
<v Speaker 1>constrained by pain and anxiety and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you can make pain worse or better </v>

141
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>by thinking about it to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only to some degree.</v>

142
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 1>When push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain is your master.</v>

143
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big constraint.</v>

144
00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big constraint.</v>

145
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the constraints are worse than that </v>

146
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:55.980
<v Speaker 1>because not only do you not</v>

147
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.380
<v Speaker 1>get to have an interpretation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that produces anxiety and </v>

148
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.451
<v Speaker 1>suffering right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get to have an </v>

149
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of the world that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>iterate it across time produces pain and</v>

150
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:11.651
<v Speaker 1>suffering and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem because there's </v>

151
00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:15.431
<v Speaker 1>lots of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could go out tonight and get </v>

152
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:16.540
<v Speaker 1>yourself blind drunk on cocaine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep with six hookers and you know,</v>

153
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe that maybe that'd be a good night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

154
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>you might not think about it being so </v>
<v Speaker 1>good tomorrow,</v>

155
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>but then maybe your dad have aids in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year or maybe you're addicted to cocaine</v>

156
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're a street alcoholic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

157
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:30.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like as an iterable game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a downhill.</v>

158
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is you play iterated </v>
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>

159
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.620
<v Speaker 1>You don't play one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you play iterated games and so your </v>

160
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.591
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of the world has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>one that will sustain multiple </v>

161
00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:44.801
<v Speaker 1>iterations across time because you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to worry about 40 year old you and 60 </v>

162
00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 1>year old you.</v>

163
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of used,</v>

164
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:53.981
<v Speaker 1>stretched over a long period of time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worse than that because it's not </v>

165
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:57.821
<v Speaker 1>just you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you and your right and not </v>

166
00:08:57.821 --> 00:09:02.151
<v Speaker 1>only so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do you have to take care of </v>

167
00:09:02.151 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 1>yourself now in a manner that allows you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take care of yourself when you're 40,</v>

168
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:08.150
<v Speaker 1>you have to take care of yourself now in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a manner that takes care of you when </v>

169
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.921
<v Speaker 1>you're 40 so that other people are happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have you around now and continually </v>

170
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 1>so that they'll cooperate and compete </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you in a positive way,</v>

171
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.250
<v Speaker 1>and so that's getting ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

172
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not just you now when you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

173
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:27.141
<v Speaker 1>it's you surrounded by other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the same thing now and in the </v>

174
00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 1>future and there's a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

175
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 1>It can even just be you and your family.</v>

176
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like like the psychopathic burglar mob </v>

177
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 1>that's just not going to go so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

178
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Other people are going to object and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world's going to object and so fine.</v>

179
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>There's an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations,</v>

180
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean there's an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of viable interpretations.</v>

181
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are hardly any,</v>

182
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 1>there are hardly any playable games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

183
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.570
<v Speaker 1>piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piaget,</v>

184
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>the developmental psychologist who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very smart guy,</v>

185
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.700
<v Speaker 1>he pointed out something very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

186
00:09:56.701 --> 00:10:01.701
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine you ran a set of iterated games </v>

187
00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:05.121
<v Speaker 1>as a competition and in one iterated </v>
<v Speaker 1>game the rule was you bloody well do </v>

188
00:10:05.121 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 1>what I tell you to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other one is,</v>

189
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll all get together and decide how </v>

190
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:12.830
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

191
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:12.830
<v Speaker 1>now we run the competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

192
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Piaget's claim is you do what I tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fails.</v>

193
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:21.290
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>impose force in order to keep you </v>

194
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 1>cooperating.</v>

195
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And the imposition of forest is a cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an efficiency cost.</v>

196
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 1>And across time that efficiency cost is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to multiply.</v>

197
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:34.371
<v Speaker 1>And the equilibrated state solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the one where we all agree it </v>

198
00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:38.721
<v Speaker 1>wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's worth thinking about and you </v>

199
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:38.721
<v Speaker 1>can think about that locally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got,</v>

200
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:43.641
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to organize your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a little family conference </v>

201
00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 1>about who's doing what in the household </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what do you.</v>

202
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 1>If you want peace and harmony and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>iterated game,</v>

203
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Speaker 1>you get everybody to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

204
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 1>here's the tasks and we have to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have to rely on that and then you</v>

205
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

206
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:59.301
<v Speaker 1>which tasks would you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to some how about you and you </v>

207
00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:02.040
<v Speaker 1>know which task would you do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody agrees and then you say,</v>

208
00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:07.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you can come up with a better </v>

209
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:07.041
<v Speaker 1>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one we're going to go with,</v>

210
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 1>and then people can be a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful and angry about the conditions</v>

211
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:14.061
<v Speaker 1>of existence where they have to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't really blame that on </v>

212
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 1>anyone else and maybe that's the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution you can come up with.</v>

213
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.390
<v Speaker 1>And that was piaget's idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equilibrium state.</v>

214
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:23.391
<v Speaker 1>It was like it's a voluntary agreement </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be iterated across time.</v>

215
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.720
<v Speaker 1>That works at multiple levels of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

216
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a serious,</v>

217
00:11:30.241 --> 00:11:32.400
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious set of constraints.</v>

218
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 1>And Piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

219
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:37.800
<v Speaker 1>was looking for a way to reconcile </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and religion.</v>

220
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.980
<v Speaker 1>He was looking for biological origin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>morality and he thought he found it in </v>

221
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the equilibrium state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even deeper than that.</v>

222
00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:50.571
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this equilibrium state ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually there's something to it that if</v>

223
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>you set the the state of property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will iterate across time so long that</v>

224
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a permanent part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

225
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchy is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what a hierarchies.</v>

226
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Hierarchies are $350,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years old.</v>

227
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 1>They are not the patriarchal invention </v>
<v Speaker 1>of white European Christian males in the</v>

228
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>last 300 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are $350 million years old.</v>

229
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.240
<v Speaker 1>They're stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stable solutions to this </v>

230
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.331
<v Speaker 1>iterated game problem and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>around so long that we're actually </v>

231
00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:24.361
<v Speaker 1>adapted to the and that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason we have archetypal </v>

232
00:12:24.361 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 1>representations of the social structure.</v>

233
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.420
<v Speaker 1>So and then we also have archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the relationship of </v>

234
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.901
<v Speaker 1>the individual to the social structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your job as an individual in </v>

235
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 1>relationship to the social structure is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to embody the social structure,</v>

236
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 1>but also to serve as as its eyes and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

237
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 1>So that can update itself wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily.</v>

238
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 1>So you take on the mantle of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

239
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's dead.</v>

240
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 1>He's the path he can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see,</v>

241
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.670
<v Speaker 1>so you take the structure that's already</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you modify it where it's </v>

242
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.761
<v Speaker 1>necessary and that modification process </v>
<v Speaker 1>is necessary or the state becomes too </v>

243
00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:07.711
<v Speaker 1>static and collapses and that's why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state has to be subordinate to the </v>

244
00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:11.491
<v Speaker 1>individual and that's what Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture has discovered and we can't just</v>

245
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 1>let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>

246
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 1>The logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big idea and you'd want to live</v>

247
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:21.721
<v Speaker 1>somewhere where you want to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere where the individual is </v>

248
00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:21.721
<v Speaker 1>subordinate to the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

249
00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:22.090
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go right ahead.</v>

250
00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:23.620
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of places like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

251
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.710
<v Speaker 1>emigrate go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of the world's countries </v>

252
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:29.890
<v Speaker 1>are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to live like that,</v>

253
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go find out what it's like.</v>

254
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't see immigration going there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
