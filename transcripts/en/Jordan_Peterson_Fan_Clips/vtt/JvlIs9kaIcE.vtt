1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.660
<v Speaker 1>The question is what is the stable way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of solving how to live together across </v>

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.281
<v Speaker 1>time and that really is the question and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the question that I'm </v>

3
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.971
<v Speaker 1>trying to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because it's a perennial problem,</v>

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.700
<v Speaker 1>we faced the problem of how to organize </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in small social units without </v>

6
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:24.891
<v Speaker 1>undue conflict and then we face the </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger problem of how to organize </v>

7
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>ourselves into large social units </v>
<v Speaker 1>without undue conflict and that conflict</v>

8
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>can be absolutely devastating and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

9
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 1>and frequently is so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I would also say that the first </v>

10
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>way of solving this problem isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>

11
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>You see not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>you may know and you may not know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

13
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>there are different forms of memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Really technically different forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>

15
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's short term working memory,</v>

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>which is the memory that you use to hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like telephone numbers in your </v>

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>active imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It decays very rapidly.</v>

18
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.040
<v Speaker 1>It's only about four to seven bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why well,</v>

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>it's white phone numbers or were at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least seven digits long.</v>

20
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of manage that as a loop.</v>

21
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.130
<v Speaker 1>That and then there's episodic memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that has two elements.</v>

22
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>One is semantic and the other is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>episodic.</v>

23
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the name of that?</v>

24
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Someone's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone said something.</v>

25
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's procedural memory and then </v>

26
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.131
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another kind of memory that you </v>

27
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>use to represent your experiences to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

28
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:49.791
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it's image Laden and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other one is semantic and semantic is </v>

29
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>your memory for facts and those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite different.</v>

30
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedural memory,</v>

31
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>that's how you ride a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you play the piano.</v>

32
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>That's how you play jazz music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a combo,</v>

33
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the memory,</v>

34
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

35
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny kind of memory because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually built right into you.</v>

36
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean so is so is the kind of memory </v>

37
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.011
<v Speaker 1>that used to represent your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's much more malleable in some </v>

38
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:19.191
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that in your </v>

39
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:23.241
<v Speaker 1>procedures there is information that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know about pattern information </v>

40
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>that you don't know about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that is how to act,</v>

41
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you walk into a social </v>

42
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.791
<v Speaker 1>gathering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really think through how </v>

43
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:34.791
<v Speaker 1>you're going to act.</v>

44
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to act and if someone asked you </v>

45
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.210
<v Speaker 1>exactly what it is that you're doing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you could formulate a story about </v>

46
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the probability that,</v>

47
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>that it's the existence of that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that enabled you to act that way is zero</v>

48
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>because you have to react way faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

49
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have social knowledge built into </v>

50
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.791
<v Speaker 1>your nervous system because you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>practiced being a social being for a </v>

51
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course then that social being has</v>

52
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>been shaped for forever really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the right way of thinking about</v>

53
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:06.540
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.610
<v Speaker 1>we know that animals organize themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>into hierarchies and we'll say of </v>

55
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>dominance because it's more true the </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther back you go in time,</v>

56
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>at least since the time of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crustaceans.</v>

57
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we split from our common ancestor </v>

58
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.820
<v Speaker 1>300 million years ago.</v>

59
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>And so it's true for social animals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>non social animals.</v>

60
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:30.571
<v Speaker 1>So even animals that don't live together</v>
<v Speaker 1>in groups have to organize themselves </v>

61
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:35.731
<v Speaker 1>into a hierarchy in this space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They inhabit songbirds are a good </v>

62
00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>example and they have dominance disputes</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

63
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Partly that's you can hear them having </v>
<v Speaker 1>their little dominance disputes in the </v>

64
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.500
<v Speaker 1>spring when they're singing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what they're saying is I'm </v>

65
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn healthy and now I'm ready to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go and if you're another bird like me,</v>

66
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>you better steer clear of this tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

67
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominant song birds,</v>

68
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't live together.</v>

69
00:03:55.751 --> 00:04:00.751
<v Speaker 1>Crows social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most songbirds aren't the dominant </v>

70
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:03.831
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Birds get the best nest and the best </v>

71
00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:05.660
<v Speaker 1>nest is the one that doesn't get rained </v>
<v Speaker 1>on and isn't,</v>

72
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.570
<v Speaker 1>it's not too windy and it's close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>food sources and you know,</v>

73
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:14.571
<v Speaker 1>and so then they have the healthiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>chicks and they attract the best mates </v>

74
00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>and like it's really important where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're positioned in the hierarchy,</v>

75
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not like a flock or herd </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>

76
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Now we're more like herd creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's even more even,</v>

77
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.470
<v Speaker 1>it's even more irrelevant to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's just no escaping a </v>

78
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.830
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical arrangement in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

79
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>in social being that is social being </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

80
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.430
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's evolutionarily ancient beyond </v>

81
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.241
<v Speaker 1>conception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 300 million years ago there weren't </v>

82
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:42.241
<v Speaker 1>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the dominance hierarchy is older than</v>

84
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:49.111
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's really something to think </v>

85
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:49.111
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

86
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>when you're thinking about the reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shaped us,</v>

87
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>say from an evolutionary perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also from a cultural perspective,</v>

88
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>what you have to understand is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that have shaped us most are the </v>

89
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 1>things that have been around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longest.</v>

90
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:07.171
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say those are the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>real things and you can't even see some </v>

91
00:05:07.171 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

92
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you can come in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's not exactly true.</v>

93
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't come in here and see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple dominance hierarchies that are </v>

94
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.690
<v Speaker 1>at work.</v>

95
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.650
<v Speaker 1>You can't in a way because the chairs </v>
<v Speaker 1>are set up to face this way and I'm </v>

96
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 1>facing that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gives you some clues about the </v>

97
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>social order here and you take the cues </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly,</v>

98
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:26.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You come down,</v>

99
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.620
<v Speaker 1>you sit in the chairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you organize yourselves according to </v>

100
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 1>mutual expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of your procedural </v>

101
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.980
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about how to behave as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>social creature.</v>

102
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Now that knowledge is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really deep and a lot of it's coded in </v>

103
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>your behavior now and another people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior as well and that's you know,</v>

104
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:50.251
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the expectations you have of </v>

105
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:52.641
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of yourself and a lot of those are </v>

106
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:52.641
<v Speaker 1>implicit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

107
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>So when we're interacting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

108
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very large number of things </v>

109
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>that you just don't get to and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that too and you won't do them.</v>

110
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.230
<v Speaker 1>And that way we can act as if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand each other even though we </v>

111
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.731
<v Speaker 1>don't because you're really complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm really complicated and there's </v>

112
00:06:09.731 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>lots of situations where we might really</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in conflict,</v>

113
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>but because we share a map of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

114
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 1>the cultural expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes part of our.</v>

115
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.350
<v Speaker 1>It's built right into our perception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will act out that set of </v>

116
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>expectations and so will I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if neither of us can do that,</v>

117
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>even if one of us can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to stay.</v>

118
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.420
<v Speaker 1>We're either going to immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>devolve into conflict or we're going to </v>

119
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.991
<v Speaker 1>avoid each other like the plague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly the right thing to </v>

120
00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:41.501
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so one of the really useful things </v>

121
00:06:41.501 --> 00:06:44.741
<v Speaker 1>to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this took me a long time to </v>

122
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:44.741
<v Speaker 1>formulate properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>you hear the terror management theorists</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

124
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>and they have this idea that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're meaning representation.</v>

125
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 1>The story you tell about the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulates your death anxiety.</v>

126
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not right.</v>

127
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's close to right and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart idea.</v>

128
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>It came from Ernest Becker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

129
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 1>who wrote a book called the denial of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

130
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>which is actually quite a good book even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's wrong,</v>

131
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a book can be very useful.</v>

132
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.490
<v Speaker 1>It can be usefully wrong in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Becker's book is usefully wrong </v>

133
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.580
<v Speaker 1>because he thought that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal representation of your belief </v>

134
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:23.621
<v Speaker 1>system that regulates your anxiety and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anxiety is fundamentally in the </v>

135
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>final analysis anxiety about death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

136
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

137
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a reasonable proposition,</v>

138
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

139
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 1>it isn't my beliefs right now that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulating my emotions.</v>

140
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that I'm acting out those </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs which include implicit </v>

141
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm acting them out and so are you,</v>

142
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>and so what you're doing and what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect more,</v>

143
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>more accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and what I want you to</v>

144
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 1>do and the way I want you to react to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's working,</v>

145
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.360
<v Speaker 1>so it's the match between my belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and the way everyone else is </v>

146
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 1>acting that's regulating my emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the belief system.</v>

147
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 1>It's mediated by the social culture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see if you understand this,</v>

148
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 1>then you understand more particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>white people are willing to fight to the</v>

149
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:15.110
<v Speaker 1>bitter end to protect their culture.</v>

150
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not a psychological structure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're protecting.</v>

151
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a psychological structure and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociological structures simultaneously,</v>

152
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.990
<v Speaker 1>so the social contract is you have a set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of expectations and I have a set of </v>

153
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 1>expectations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There actually desires.</v>

154
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 1>They're not merely expectations because </v>
<v Speaker 1>as living creatures,</v>

155
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:39.461
<v Speaker 1>we're desirous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't just expect and so you desire </v>

156
00:08:39.461 --> 00:08:43.201
<v Speaker 1>and outcome and I desire outcome and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree to act in accordance with that.</v>

157
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:48.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the social contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so people don't like to having that </v>

158
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:48.670
<v Speaker 1>disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

159
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 1>it isn't because it's psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>destabilizes them.</v>

160
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Although it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it actually destabilizes </v>

161
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.490
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

162
00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:01.491
<v Speaker 1>If all of a sudden we can't occupy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same specified domain of territory,</v>

163
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>it isn't only that we're thrown into </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological disarray,</v>

164
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:10.821
<v Speaker 1>although we will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that will start fighting with each </v>

165
00:09:10.821 --> 00:09:11.790
<v Speaker 1>other like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that can kill you.</v>

166
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kills people a lot.</v>

167
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Like it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can happen very easily,</v>

168
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:22.311
<v Speaker 1>that are cohesive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social Group can fragment along some </v>

169
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 1>fracture line of identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

170
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and all hell breaks loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

171
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened with the Tutsis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hutu and in,</v>

172
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Rwanda,</v>

173
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:36.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those things can get out of control </v>

174
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 1>just so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just unbelievable.</v>

175
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that wasn't death anxiety,</v>

176
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 1>that was death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different thing.</v>

177
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's the other thing that terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>management people don't exactly get.</v>

178
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:50.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like it isn't just that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and your cultural beliefs </v>

179
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 1>protect you from anxiety and say anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 1>about death.</v>

180
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:56.721
<v Speaker 1>Even it's that they actually protect you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from death as well as protecting you </v>

181
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 1>from death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety.</v>

182
00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

183
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>it's warm in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cold outside.</v>

184
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.590
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the culture is intact </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you're not outside freezing.</v>

185
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:12.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a lot more fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense than mere anxiety.</v>

186
00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm not trying to underplay the</v>
<v Speaker 1>role of anxiety,</v>

187
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:20.571
<v Speaker 1>that's a major issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something that's a lot more </v>

188
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 1>fundamental at stake than mere </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

189
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.420
<v Speaker 1>so it's the match between your map of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and other people's actions </v>

190
00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>that regulates your emotion and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulates it completely.</v>
