1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>And so look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone stands up and says there's </v>

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.541
<v Speaker 1>something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you should ask is what </v>

3
00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:11.391
<v Speaker 1>makes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should I assume that you know what </v>

4
00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:11.391
<v Speaker 1>the hell you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>you investigate it and you find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the person does know what</v>

7
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about and on the issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm describing to you tonight,</v>

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm talking about now.</v>

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.380
<v Speaker 1>People have been on my case about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very serious way for quite a long </v>

10
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.821
<v Speaker 1>time and so far they haven't made any </v>
<v Speaker 1>inroads into my arguments and most of </v>

11
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>the time they're too damn cowardly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate me.</v>

12
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:41.451
<v Speaker 1>Which is also something that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because I've put out public </v>

13
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:41.451
<v Speaker 1>calls constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you.</v>

14
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>You want a debate about gender and sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just bring it on because that </v>

15
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.181
<v Speaker 1>actually happens to be an area of </v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise for me and I know the damn </v>

16
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:53.691
<v Speaker 1>literature and if you want to come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make your case that all the </v>

17
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>differences between men and women are </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially constructed,</v>

18
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>culturally constructed or that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

19
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Or that they're just a personal whim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is exactly what's </v>

20
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>written into the policies surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill c 16.</v>

21
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Then you come out and make that case </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly and see how well it stands up </v>

22
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 1>and I know how well it'll stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that kind of thinking was </v>

23
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.911
<v Speaker 1>defeated in the scientific realm back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties in the universities and </v>

24
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:22.191
<v Speaker 1>what that meant was that the radicals </v>
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to keep promoting precisely </v>

25
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>that kind of view just circumvented the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire scientific process and started to</v>

26
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:30.561
<v Speaker 1>implement their demands for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular viewpoint from a practical </v>

27
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:34.971
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>administrative and legislative </v>

28
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing full well that they had lost 100</v>

29
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>percent on the empirical and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific front,</v>

30
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.250
<v Speaker 1>and now what they do instead is </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized the scientific endeavor </v>

31
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.880
<v Speaker 1>itself because it failed to produce the </v>
<v Speaker 1>results that they assumed would be the </v>

32
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.481
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's plenty that's rotten in the </v>

33
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:54.681
<v Speaker 1>state of Denmark and I'm embarrassed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>state that a tremendous amount of that </v>

34
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>stems from the universities and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in bad shape.</v>

35
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Do not send your children to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities.</v>

36
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're corrupt.</v>

37
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.630
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>

38
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

39
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>They won't learn to think because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists don't believe in </v>

40
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.241
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't learn logic because the </v>

41
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:20.221
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist believed that logic is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tools that the oppressive </v>

42
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy uses to sustain its </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive patriarchy,</v>

43
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 1>oppressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal nature.</v>

44
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.020
<v Speaker 1>They won't learn to write well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because writing,</v>

45
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>teaching people to write takes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of effort and perhaps </v>

46
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>they're not so much interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching people to formulate their own </v>

47
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.341
<v Speaker 1>thoughts precisely and carefully as they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are interested in producing tall like </v>

48
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 1>clones to go out and do their activist </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

49
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>which is precisely what they stayed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their website.</v>

50
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>things are not so pretty and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very embarrassing as a member </v>

52
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 1>of the academy and to come before a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of,</v>

53
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>of public citizens and say you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>betrayed by your institutions,</v>

54
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>higher learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sad,</v>

55
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 1>it's sad and it's not good.</v>

56
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

57
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the university,</v>

58
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>it's just an ivory tower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

59
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>think again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

60
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>what happens in the university's happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere five years later.</v>

61
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's no mere ivory tower issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

62
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a couple of weeks ago,</v>

63
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.360
<v Speaker 1>a couple of months ago I did this </v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture and Vancouver called a leftwing </v>

64
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.220
<v Speaker 1>case for free speech because you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually make a left wing case for free </v>

65
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.220
<v Speaker 1>speech pretty easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

66
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like obviously some people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>more influence and authority than others</v>

67
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:38.221
<v Speaker 1>and just as obviously it's harder for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people with less influence and </v>

68
00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:41.911
<v Speaker 1>authority to make their case known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so clearly they need to be able to make </v>

69
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:45.481
<v Speaker 1>their case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the left wing case for free </v>

70
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:45.481
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fairly straight forward.</v>

71
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I thought it needed to be made because </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the radical left,</v>

72
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:53.431
<v Speaker 1>people seem to have forgotten that free </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech was actually their most what </v>

73
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:58.020
<v Speaker 1>welcome friend and and enabled them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever good things they did manage </v>

74
00:03:58.061 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>to do over the last hundred years.</v>

75
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>But I made a left wing case and so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was easy and reasonably entertaining and</v>

76
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>you can watch that on youtube if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

77
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.950
<v Speaker 1>And so tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I thought I do as a counterpart to </v>

78
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.741
<v Speaker 1>that is layout what I believe might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>some tenants for a viable 21st century </v>

79
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>conservatism and these are ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing with.</v>

80
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote down about 12 of them.</v>

81
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we'll get through all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

82
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>but we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can start with a few and this is what</v>

83
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 1>the Conservatives could be selling to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the public.</v>

84
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Now what seems to me to be happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead at the moment is as Kathleen </v>

85
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Wynne flames out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not nearly fast enough in my opinion.</v>

86
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.700
<v Speaker 1>The attitude among conservatives at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>provincial party seems to be something,</v>

88
00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:45.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just go like go,</v>

89
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 1>let's go cluster in a corner and not do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything too stupid because maybe she'll</v>

90
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:54.011
<v Speaker 1>burn yourself out so badly that will win</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next election and we won't have to </v>

91
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:56.090
<v Speaker 1>do anything that will put us at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not being cynical about that.</v>

92
00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I can understand the utility of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>

93
00:04:59.091 --> 00:05:04.091
<v Speaker 1>Although I think it's a bad policy and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's a bad policy because there </v>

94
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:08.231
<v Speaker 1>are some things that seriously need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be said about Kathleen Wynne in her </v>

95
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.800
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can tell you one noble aim for the</v>

96
00:05:09.801 --> 00:05:14.801
<v Speaker 1>provincial conservatives for the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>election would be to decimate the </v>

97
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:17.330
<v Speaker 1>provincial liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not One should be left.</v>

98
00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:19.010
<v Speaker 1>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your popularity at right now?</v>

99
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Under 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she had a shred of integrity,</v>

100
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.900
<v Speaker 1>she would've already resigned.</v>

101
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a goal for the conservatives </v>

102
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.320
<v Speaker 1>know liberal sitting after the 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 1>election that would send a message to </v>

103
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.791
<v Speaker 1>the social justice warrior types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would also send a message to the </v>

104
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:40.271
<v Speaker 1>centrists who should actually be </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupying the positions of power in the </v>

105
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Liberal Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if you allow yourself to be taken </v>

106
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.301
<v Speaker 1>over by a radical fringe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get decimated at the </v>

107
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.691
<v Speaker 1>Poles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know that might be an exciting </v>

108
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:49.691
<v Speaker 1>message to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young people.</v>

109
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Get out there and knock on some doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if you can take the social justice </v>

110
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.181
<v Speaker 1>warriors out at the top before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they do more damage than already </v>

111
00:05:58.181 --> 00:06:02.621
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's got another year to do plenty of </v>

112
00:06:02.621 --> 00:06:04.841
<v Speaker 1>damage and you can be sure that she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do plenty more damage in that </v>

113
00:06:04.841 --> 00:06:04.841
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

114
00:06:04.841 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

115
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Here's some things you might think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a conservative.</v>

116
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 1>These things have become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>

117
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>People are afraid to say them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the first one.</v>

118
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental assumptions of Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization are valid.</v>

119
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.340
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's not.</v>

120
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>You think it's an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

121
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.990
<v Speaker 1>here's how you find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

122
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.750
<v Speaker 1>which countries do people want to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from?</v>

123
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not ours.</v>

124
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Which countries do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People wanting to move two hours.</v>

125
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They work better and it's not because we</v>

126
00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:45.370
<v Speaker 1>went around the world stealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

127
00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:49.150
<v Speaker 1>We could get our hands on it because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got certain fundamental assumptions,</v>

128
00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:51.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God for that.</v>

129
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.790
<v Speaker 1>After thousands and thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trying and because of that,</v>

130
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:59.110
<v Speaker 1>we've managed to establish a set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations that are shining lights in</v>

131
00:06:59.111 --> 00:07:04.111
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know now you can be pretty damn </v>

132
00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:04.150
<v Speaker 1>filthy and still be a shining light in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this world,</v>

133
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:09.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you look around the world at </v>

134
00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:11.251
<v Speaker 1>the state of governance in most places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the most pathological corrupt </v>

135
00:07:11.251 --> 00:07:15.280
<v Speaker 1>and vicious thugs rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to stand out as an illuminated light</v>

136
00:07:15.281 --> 00:07:17.260
<v Speaker 1>against that background is it so </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

137
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.440
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know we're as good as it's gone and </v>

138
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.780
<v Speaker 1>unless we can come up with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

139
00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:25.180
<v Speaker 1>we should be very careful about messing </v>
<v Speaker 1>around with that.</v>

140
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.300
<v Speaker 1>So why don't we start with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that we're doing something </v>

141
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things we're doing right,</v>

142
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.621
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we actually value the </v>

143
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:34.621
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

144
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.120
<v Speaker 1>The individual has intrinsic value in </v>
<v Speaker 1>western societies.</v>

145
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how long it took people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulate that as an idea and how </v>

146
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.510
<v Speaker 1>unlikely that ideas that poor you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

147
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.380
<v Speaker 1>useless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerless you with all your damn fault,</v>

148
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.250
<v Speaker 1>you're actually worth something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're worth something to the point that</v>

149
00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:54.190
<v Speaker 1>the law has to respect you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

150
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.880
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to abandon that for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>half witted collectivism,</v>

151
00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:02.881
<v Speaker 1>which we're doing as rapidly as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that </v>

152
00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:06.130
<v Speaker 1>characterizes the radical left types is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a damn about you as an </v>

153
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.321
<v Speaker 1>individual or about individuals at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're black or you're white or you're </v>

154
00:08:10.321 --> 00:08:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Latino or you're transsexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're homosexual or whatever.</v>

155
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.210
<v Speaker 1>You're a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a member of a group,</v>

156
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.190
<v Speaker 1>and the only thing that matters is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

157
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you if the only thing that </v>

158
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.651
<v Speaker 1>matters is the group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bloody well don't matter very much </v>

159
00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:29.280
<v Speaker 1>and then you got to ask yourself just </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what sort of people are trying </v>

160
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.971
<v Speaker 1>to set things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is that the individual doesn't </v>

161
00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:33.100
<v Speaker 1>matter very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.220
<v Speaker 1>it's the sort of people to whom the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual doesn't matter very much and </v>

163
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:42.001
<v Speaker 1>I might suggest that you don't elect </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and that when they attempt to take </v>

164
00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:42.630
<v Speaker 1>power that you do everything you can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

165
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

166
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's assumption number one,</v>

167
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 1>the assumption number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful social being is preferable,</v>

168
00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.260
<v Speaker 1>isolation and to war in consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>justly and rightly demand some sacrifice</v>

169
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 1>of individual impulsivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idiosyncrasy,</v>

170
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you want to live alone in the bush,</v>

171
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.260
<v Speaker 1>you're going to starve to death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat,</v>

172
00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>and by black flies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good solution.</v>

173
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to cooperate with other </v>

174
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.591
<v Speaker 1>people and that means you can't get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be your whimsical self 100 percent of </v>

175
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:22.821
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that most of you has to be </v>

176
00:09:22.821 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed so that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately like everyone else.</v>

177
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real sacrifice,</v>

178
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:27.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

179
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a sacrifice of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

180
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 1>It might even be a sacrifice of some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unique qualities that everyone needs</v>

181
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:35.610
<v Speaker 1>from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socialization costs,</v>

182
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>but the advantage of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

183
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 1>we get to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

184
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.880
<v Speaker 1>we can all sit together in this hall and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one has their hands around each </v>

185
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 1>other's throats and we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious things.</v>

186
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's worth something.</v>

187
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.820
<v Speaker 1>And what is worth in parties?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to be whatever </v>

188
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.300
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly colored creature you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be all the time.</v>

189
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to do what you can to be normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and predictable and it's not like normal</v>

190
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:05.010
<v Speaker 1>and predictable is the highest virtue </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not and and being more than</v>

191
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:10.011
<v Speaker 1>normal and being and being unique and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative and contributing in our way is </v>

192
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:13.911
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental point is is that </v>

193
00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:17.330
<v Speaker 1>social being requires the sacrifice of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of individually </v>

194
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncrasy and that's a fundamentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative claim.</v>

195
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should do what everyone else does,</v>

196
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 1>unless you have a really good reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>vary.</v>

197
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:32.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a good rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you do what people have done </v>

198
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 1>throughout time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You grow up,</v>

199
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you find a partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you establish a stable relationship,</v>

200
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 1>you get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make yourself useful.</v>

201
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.400
<v Speaker 1>You have some children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do something productive and </v>

202
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.191
<v Speaker 1>interesting with your spare time and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to act like a respectable human </v>

203
00:10:46.191 --> 00:10:46.440
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>

204
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a conservative ethos and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

205
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:54.230
<v Speaker 1>If you have something spectacular about </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that needs to be revealed to the </v>

206
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.750
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then break some rules,</v>

207
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:55.770
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go right ahead.</v>

208
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time you don't,</v>

209
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.640
<v Speaker 1>and even if you happen to be a special </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and you might be 90 percent of </v>

210
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.291
<v Speaker 1>you still isn't special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so most of the time you're still going </v>

211
00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 1>to be following the rules and the rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't there to oppress.</v>

212
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:15.610
<v Speaker 1>They're there to keep us at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there to keep us away from each </v>

213
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.011
<v Speaker 1>other's throats because human beings are</v>
<v Speaker 1>very warlike and we're very competitive </v>

214
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.260
<v Speaker 1>and we're very aggressive and if we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate enough to have woven together </v>

215
00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:29.850
<v Speaker 1>a social fabric that basically renders </v>
<v Speaker 1>us peaceful and cooperative,</v>

216
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:35.090
<v Speaker 1>we should try disrupting that at our </v>
<v Speaker 1>great peril.</v>

217
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Because the general rule for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>

218
00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:45.750
<v Speaker 1>throat the centuries has been turmoil </v>
<v Speaker 1>and war and we don't have that here.</v>

219
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 1>And so thank God for that and it's worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a sacrifice.</v>
