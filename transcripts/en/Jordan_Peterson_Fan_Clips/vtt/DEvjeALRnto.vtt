00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Hello Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much.</v>

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.630
<v Speaker 1>And my question is regarding Adhd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something I haven't heard you </v>

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>speak a whole lot about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit.</v>

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it seems to me that we are at least </v>

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>maybe just me do not quite understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>adhd to what could be its full capacity </v>

6
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:23.211
<v Speaker 1>maybe and because there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many voices saying that it's an </v>

7
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:27.831
<v Speaker 1>overdiagnosed overblown small mental </v>
<v Speaker 1>variants that's prevalent in boys or </v>

8
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>it's just young boys being young boys </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there are some that would fight</v>

9
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>and advocate for a very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment in the academic world.</v>

10
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>And I was wondering what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your thoughts are on Adhd itself.</v>

11
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the,</v>

12
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>whether you think it's overdiagnosed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe advice for me as someone who has </v>

13
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.571
<v Speaker 1>been diagnosed with adhd on how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome it without maybe becoming </v>

14
00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>completely reliant on prescribed </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

15
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first of all,</v>

17
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.910
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely overdiagnosed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second,</v>

18
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 3>it's very unreliable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psychiatric diagnosis.</v>

19
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Many psychiatric diagnosis are </v>
<v Speaker 3>unreliable and that's because </v>

20
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.450
<v Speaker 3>psychiatric diagnosis aren't precisely </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific categories.</v>

21
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:21.740
<v Speaker 3>They're weird hybrids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

22
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:23.960
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrists aren't scientists.</v>

23
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:28.961
<v Speaker 3>They're engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Engineers are trying to do something </v>

24
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:31.811
<v Speaker 3>rather than to describe the objective </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and psychiatrists are trying to </v>

25
00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:32.180
<v Speaker 3>make people healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever that means.</v>

26
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.300
<v Speaker 3>It's actually partly ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very complicated.</v>

27
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.630
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how to distinguish it from</v>
<v Speaker 3>temperamental variation,</v>

28
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 3>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're high in openness and high in </v>

29
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 3>extroversion and low in </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness,</v>

30
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 3>low in agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conscientiousness and and high in </v>

31
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.291
<v Speaker 3>neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're likely to manifest symptoms of </v>

32
00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 3>Adhd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because your exploratory,</v>

33
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.110
<v Speaker 3>you don't like to sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're full of ideas.</v>

34
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:08.111
<v Speaker 3>Your attention scatters across a wide </v>
<v Speaker 3>variety of topics and you're not very </v>

35
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:12.191
<v Speaker 3>stable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Temperamental variation is also much </v>

36
00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:12.191
<v Speaker 3>more common among boys.</v>

37
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Panksepp showed same guy with rats that </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you deprive young routes of rough and</v>

38
00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:25.331
<v Speaker 3>tumble play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what the young boys are </v>

39
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:28.211
<v Speaker 3>deprived of in school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that they get hyperactive and </v>

40
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 3>then their prefrontal cortex is don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>develop very well because they're not </v>

41
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.871
<v Speaker 3>having the right kind of experiences and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can treat that quite </v>

42
00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 3>effectively with psychomotor stimulants </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Ritalin.</v>

43
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 3>So that's kind of an interesting bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific information that no one pays </v>

44
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.121
<v Speaker 3>any attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is also absolutely no evidence </v>

45
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:52.781
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever that longterm use of </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychomotor stimulants produces </v>

46
00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 3>increases in cognitive gain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero,</v>

47
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 3>and there's plenty of evidence that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>harmful.</v>

48
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 3>So then the second part of that was what</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

49
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

50
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.220
<v Speaker 3>adjustments for in the academic world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say disability adjustments.</v>

51
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:16.711
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's such a rat's nest that I don't </v>

52
00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:16.711
<v Speaker 3>want to even discuss it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>

53
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll discuss it for like 15 seconds.</v>

54
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 3>There is a never ending multiplication </v>
<v Speaker 3>of disability.</v>

55
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.810
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The disability offices in the </v>

56
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 3>universities are swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know some people have it rough,</v>

57
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 3>like believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that I,</v>

58
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seriously know that I've dealt with </v>

59
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 3>extraordinarily damaged people in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

60
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

61
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 3>you're bloody hard pressed to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who doesn't have a serious </v>

62
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.291
<v Speaker 3>problem or who doesn't have a serious </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem in a close family member.</v>

63
00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you draw the line with regards </v>

64
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.530
<v Speaker 3>to disability where you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

65
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.700
<v Speaker 3>They multiply just like lgbt identities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Multiply.</v>

66
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.880
<v Speaker 3>Just knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She really technically just like that.</v>

67
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.840
<v Speaker 3>Just like intersectionality categories </v>
<v Speaker 3>of oppression multiply.</v>

68
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.870
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

69
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.160
<v Speaker 3>it's inevitable the way that you deal </v>
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>

70
00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:19.160
<v Speaker 3>As you have objective standards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you apply them to everyone.</v>

71
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Not because that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair.</v>

72
00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:27.161
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If your criteria for fairness is that </v>

73
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:27.620
<v Speaker 3>everyone has the same outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fair at all.</v>

74
00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:32.621
<v Speaker 3>It's not even close to fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just less piratical than the </v>

75
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:36.521
<v Speaker 3>alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we don't know that yet because we </v>

76
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:39.311
<v Speaker 3>haven't seen the full range of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tyranny of the alternatives manifests </v>

77
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:39.920
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in our culture,</v>

78
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:43.820
<v Speaker 3>but it certainly did in other cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a bad idea now.</v>

79
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be absolute about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's tricky,</v>

80
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you have a disability</v>

81
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

82
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.570
<v Speaker 3>would allow you to do the work in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university and in the workplace with a </v>

83
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.451
<v Speaker 3>modification,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then perhaps the modification could be </v>

84
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:11.291
<v Speaker 3>made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that was done a lot better </v>

85
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:11.291
<v Speaker 3>when I was in the hands of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>professors and not in the hands of these</v>

86
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.100
<v Speaker 3>crazy bureaucratic structures that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>risen up around the disability issue.</v>

87
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 3>Like they're one of the 10 things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to kill the universities or </v>

88
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.061
<v Speaker 3>maybe have already killed them possibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they made their walking corpses </v>

89
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:28.100
<v Speaker 3>as far as I can tell zombies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so and that might be wrong,</v>

90
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:33.101
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it looks like to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus I want to say thank you so much </v>

91
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:36.680
<v Speaker 3>is an amazing talk and I was wondering </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could elaborate.</v>

92
00:05:36.681 --> 00:05:41.681
<v Speaker 3>What I noticed a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go here to UBC is that a lot of </v>

93
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:43.010
<v Speaker 3>students and young people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're often desensitized to,</v>

94
00:05:43.011 --> 00:05:48.011
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the atrocities that communism or </v>

95
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.621
<v Speaker 3>ideologies that forced terrorism and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's some sort of Stockholm </v>

96
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:54.170
<v Speaker 3>syndrome that I'm seeing where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are just there,</v>

97
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>they're like trapped and they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel in way they can do anything</v>

98
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.680
<v Speaker 4>about it and then they start to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

99
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 4>like communism or they start to see more</v>
<v Speaker 4>social or adopt socialist policy that in</v>

100
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 4>the end we'll get them killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll get them hurt.</v>

101
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 4>As long as you kind of elaborate on what</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think can be done about that or even</v>

102
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 4>if something can be done in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>respect.</v>

103
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think something can be done.</v>

104
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:21.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to educate people about</v>

105
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.190
<v Speaker 3>the horrors of the Nazi regime in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Soviet regime in particular.</v>

106
00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:30.180
<v Speaker 3>I've concentrated mostly on those two </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars,</v>

107
00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:35.181
<v Speaker 3>but that's good enough and trying to let</v>
<v Speaker 3>people know that it was through the </v>

108
00:06:38.021 --> 00:06:39.700
<v Speaker 3>fault of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much like them,</v>

109
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:44.701
<v Speaker 3>that those systems are rows and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there are steps you can take to</v>

110
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:51.601
<v Speaker 3>limit the probability that you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>participate in such a thing and that </v>

111
00:06:51.601 --> 00:06:55.651
<v Speaker 3>those steps are associated with trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be truthful in your speech and </v>

112
00:06:55.651 --> 00:06:59.641
<v Speaker 3>actions because the stability of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems depends on the willingness of </v>

113
00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:03.721
<v Speaker 3>individuals to lie and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also on your willingness to take </v>

114
00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:07.420
<v Speaker 3>responsibility for the malevolence in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own heart.</v>

115
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.270
<v Speaker 3>That manifests itself in those social </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements.</v>

116
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.070
<v Speaker 3>And so that when I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I do my lectures,</v>

117
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:20.380
<v Speaker 3>when I do talks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I put them on Youtube,</v>

118
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.410
<v Speaker 3>what I'm trying to do is exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that was the best pathway </v>

119
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:30.160
<v Speaker 3>forward through such things that I could</v>
<v Speaker 3>think up over 20 years of thinking about</v>

120
00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:30.280
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

121
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

122
00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:38.131
<v Speaker 3>one is so habituated to suffering that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can read the Gulag archipelago,</v>

123
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.900
<v Speaker 3>which is actually quite hard to read </v>
<v Speaker 3>without having an effect them like your </v>

124
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.710
<v Speaker 3>psychopathic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that book doesn't affect you,</v>

125
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should,</v>

126
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.720
<v Speaker 3>if you read it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it affects you deeply.</v>

127
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.350
<v Speaker 3>And it's not the only example of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of literature.</v>

128
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:05.010
<v Speaker 3>So the people who are habituated aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've just been shown low resolution </v>

129
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.800
<v Speaker 3>representations of things they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that looked vaguely bad.</v>

130
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 3>They don't know a damn thing about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And our education system has done a </v>

131
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.910
<v Speaker 3>tremendously appalling job of educating </v>
<v Speaker 3>young people about the absolute </v>

132
00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:22.870
<v Speaker 3>catastrophe of radical leftism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's not much better with regards to</v>

133
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:28.140
<v Speaker 3>say the actions of the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I would say on average people </v>

134
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.110
<v Speaker 3>are more aware of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't.</v>

135
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.420
<v Speaker 3>But it's shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shallow knowledge.</v>

136
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:37.140
<v Speaker 3>So you make the knowledge deep and deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge changes people and wakes them </v>

137
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:37.420
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

138
00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.230
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

139
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:43.590
<v Speaker 3>the only reason that I ever got </v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced that they're that good and </v>

140
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:43.590
<v Speaker 3>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're real more,</v>

141
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.350
<v Speaker 3>more real than anything else wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I learned that good was real.</v>

142
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.530
<v Speaker 3>That's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hard.</v>

143
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.880
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to learn that you have to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>examples of transcendent good,</v>

144
00:08:54.881 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're rare,</v>

145
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 3>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is look,</v>

146
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.360
<v Speaker 3>read history a bit and read it like it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>about you and there's no way that you </v>

147
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 3>can do that without a transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people won't do it.</v>

148
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like you want to imagine yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>as an Auschwitz guard.</v>

149
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a rough thing you see because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to figure out,</v>

150
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 3>see young set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you confronted the shadow,</v>

151
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 3>which was the dark side of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the aggressive side,</v>

152
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:24.460
<v Speaker 3>the malevolent side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it,</v>

153
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 3>it really reaches all the way down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell and Dante sort of was trying to put</v>

154
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 3>forward the same thing when he wrote the</v>
<v Speaker 3>inferno,</v>

155
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:32.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

156
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 3>With the levels of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

157
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Because it was a voyage through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels of evil,</v>

158
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:38.780
<v Speaker 3>right to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought the bottom was betrayal.</v>

159
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.630
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

160
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 3>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the center of malevolence as betrayal.</v>

161
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 3>I liked that because to be trained </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

162
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 3>you have to get them to trust you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and trust is a moral virtue,</v>

163
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if it's courageous trust,</v>

164
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.240
<v Speaker 3>because it it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it puts you in alignment with other </v>

165
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.431
<v Speaker 3>people and allows you to move forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>into life and if you'd be trained that </v>

166
00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:58.431
<v Speaker 3>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a knife in the.</v>

167
00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like knife in the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the back,</v>

168
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.120
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's someone who loves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loves you,</v>

169
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:08.121
<v Speaker 3>betrays you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially if they be trey you for </v>

170
00:10:08.121 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 3>your virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a really nice twist.</v>

171
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.820
<v Speaker 3>So I believe because I think that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are capable of good,</v>

172
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 3>that if they know enough about evil that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will straighten them out.</v>

173
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who wants that?</v>

174
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is one of the things I really like </v>

175
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.571
<v Speaker 3>about young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's often regarded as a new age </v>

176
00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:29.571
<v Speaker 3>thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's wrong.</v>

177
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 3>He's no new age thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew that the,</v>

178
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:38.550
<v Speaker 3>the pathway to enlightenment was barred </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the necessity of a passage through </v>

179
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 3>hell and that no one was going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

180
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.560
<v Speaker 3>That's why there isn't a world full of </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightened people.</v>

181
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:51.561
<v Speaker 3>You might say like it was just a matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>of doing nice things following your </v>

182
00:10:51.561 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 3>bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say however you might put it.</v>

183
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 3>Then why wouldn't everyone walk up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stairway to heaven?</v>

184
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.540
<v Speaker 3>That isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not how it works at all.</v>

185
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can be convinced of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the necessity for moral action until you</v>

186
00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:12.171
<v Speaker 3>understand exactly how dark and terrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>things can get and that it's your fault </v>

187
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:15.270
<v Speaker 3>that they're getting that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who wants to think that?</v>

188
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 3>So you can think it though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not.</v>

189
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Not Without it burning you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thanks.</v>
