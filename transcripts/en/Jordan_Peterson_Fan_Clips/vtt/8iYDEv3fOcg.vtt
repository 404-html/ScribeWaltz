1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.120
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.190
<v Speaker 1>you get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do a bunch of things and someone </v>

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>asks you what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you did and you,</v>

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell them,</v>

5
00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:16.151
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing I did this morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>was open my eyes and the second thing </v>

6
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>was thinking about whether I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to sleep and then,</v>

7
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took off my blankets and then I put my</v>

8
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>feet on the floor and then I stood up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was blinking while I was doing all</v>

9
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>this and I was also breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

10
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked for my claw and you really want</v>

11
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>to listen to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to listen to that guy.</v>

12
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you,</v>

13
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.230
<v Speaker 1>why are you telling me that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to tell me something </v>

14
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.440
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>what is it that's interesting and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that interesting?</v>

16
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

17
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>so then imagine the guy actually tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a pretty good story and a little </v>

18
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 1>adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably he was doing something normal.</v>

19
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Something unexpected happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to conjure up some new responses </v>

20
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>and he either settled the problem or </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't settle the problem.</v>

21
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in that.</v>

22
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Especially if he settled the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if he can tell you how when he </v>

23
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>encountered some unexplored territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was able to sew it back together,</v>

24
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you can do that when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing happens and how it's pretty cheap </v>

25
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>wisdom for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

26
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.520
<v Speaker 1>He had to go through all the aggravation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of figuring it out.</v>

27
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do is listen.</v>

28
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's kind of a classic story.</v>

29
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Classic Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking is there's a guy or </v>

30
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter,</v>

31
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>go into both their life relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally,</v>

32
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.600
<v Speaker 1>something blindsides them and they're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a state of chaos.</v>

33
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is the place that you end up when </v>

34
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and the world stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>matching and the chaos can be of </v>

35
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>different degrees.</v>

36
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could wake up and find that your </v>

37
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.901
<v Speaker 1>house was burgled and you could wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and find that a parent has your parent </v>

38
00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 1>has Alzheimer's or some fatal disease or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do,</v>

39
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.830
<v Speaker 1>or that your whole family was murdered </v>
<v Speaker 1>or that there's a war starting or you </v>

40
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.521
<v Speaker 1>know there's different degrees of chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you can quantify the chaos </v>

41
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:17.831
<v Speaker 1>by calculating how much of what you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and expect is likely to be disrupted by </v>

42
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:25.511
<v Speaker 1>the event now because that the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>disruption,</v>

43
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.260
<v Speaker 1>the more destabilized you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

44
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.440
<v Speaker 1>which is why if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone tells you that you're going </v>

45
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.771
<v Speaker 1>to perish painfully in three months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's a bad one.</v>

46
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>You're really in an unexpected territory</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

47
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:45.581
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that you assumed that was real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking in the world is real </v>

48
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:51.161
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like to watch people in their normal </v>

49
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:56.331
<v Speaker 1>life blindsided by something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing this inter regnum of where </v>

50
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:04.891
<v Speaker 1>they explore and gather new information </v>
<v Speaker 1>and retooled their character or retool </v>

51
00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:10.811
<v Speaker 1>the world because you could either of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those would work as a solution and then </v>

52
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>come out the other side and things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than they were to begin with,</v>

53
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>or at least as good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but better is better.</v>

54
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a happy ending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a happy ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a comedy,</v>

56
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.950
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so</v>

57
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.850
<v Speaker 1>what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want your life to be a comedy.</v>

58
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's supposed to be funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>because comedy doesn't have to be funny </v>

59
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.740
<v Speaker 1>technically speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the opposite of tragedy.</v>

60
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Tragedy is when you're going along </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well and you get blindsided and </v>

61
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.640
<v Speaker 1>that's that and you know that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly happen.</v>

62
00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:43.400
<v Speaker 1>It happens to people all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a comedy you want.</v>

63
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Now what I hope to provide you with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a magic code?</v>

64
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a book published a while back.</v>

65
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Tom Hanks was in the movie who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>harvard professor who went around </v>

66
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>solving symbolic mysteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember what?</v>

67
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>What was it called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Davinci Code.</v>

68
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Everyone liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sold a lot and you know,</v>

69
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:23.341
<v Speaker 1>it was a little mysteries and it's full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hints that there was more to the </v>

70
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:26.881
<v Speaker 1>world than you think and which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely true and that,</v>

71
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a way of getting access to </v>

72
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>that knowledge and then it would really </v>
<v Speaker 1>be worthwhile and people liked that.</v>

73
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>They liked that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because it's </v>

74
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true,</v>

75
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.280
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

76
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fiction is true.</v>

77
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:49.531
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to the guy who's telling </v>

78
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:49.531
<v Speaker 1>you about his morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

79
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:53.371
<v Speaker 1>he tells you something exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then imagine that 10 people tell </v>

80
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:58.201
<v Speaker 1>you something exciting and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract out the pattern of them dealing </v>

81
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>with this problem from that.</v>

82
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do if you're an author,</v>

83
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in a,</v>

84
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.640
<v Speaker 1>in a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want the book exactly to be </v>

85
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>about what ordinary people do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary times in their life.</v>

86
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like you already know how to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary during ordinary times of your </v>

87
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.510
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

88
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>That's not useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't watch a video tape of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

90
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you videotaped yourself during a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and then the next day you watched </v>

91
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like God,</v>

92
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.260
<v Speaker 1>who would want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what seems to happen in stories is </v>

93
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>that they distill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they distill,</v>

94
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.310
<v Speaker 1>so they watch people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people watch people and then they tell </v>

95
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.091
<v Speaker 1>stories about what they see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they leave a lot out of those </v>

96
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that's boring hopefully,</v>

97
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.120
<v Speaker 1>and then more and more stories about </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting things get sort of aggregated </v>

98
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe a great writer comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>along and write something really,</v>

99
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound character transformations,</v>

100
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

101
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>that's fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you say,</v>

102
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true because it's fiction,</v>

103
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>but then then maybe that's not right.</v>

104
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's more than true because who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants the truth?</v>

105
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 1>The truth is mundane reality and you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>already got that mastered.</v>

106
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.770
<v Speaker 1>What you want is the distillation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting experience and you might </v>

107
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

108
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>why is it interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good question because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't actually know and believe me,</v>

110
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:32.471
<v Speaker 1>you really don't know because you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in things that just don't </v>

111
00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:35.351
<v Speaker 1>make any sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to walk you a bit today </v>

112
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 1>through Pinocchio and we'll do that more</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next time to,</v>

113
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to tell you a little bit </v>

114
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.390
<v Speaker 1>about that movie to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>

115
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>how crazy you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know the plot.</v>

116
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>How many people have seen the Disney </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>

117
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

118
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.990
<v Speaker 1>So lots of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's strange enough in itself that </v>

119
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>so many people have seen it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth thinking about.</v>

120
00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:59.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tend to show your kids that moody </v>

121
00:06:59.801 --> 00:06:59.801
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think about the movie?</v>

122
00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:04.391
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing some pretty weird things </v>

123
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:04.391
<v Speaker 1>when you're sitting there watching that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

124
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:05.120
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

125
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 1>it's drawings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>And they're low resolution drawings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care.</v>

127
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.900
<v Speaker 1>And you watch the simpsons or maybe fit </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a.</v>

128
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 1>what's that called?</v>

129
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.790
<v Speaker 1>The the one that's been concentrating on</v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness so much south </v>

130
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.790
<v Speaker 1>park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

131
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 1>that animation man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just awful,</v>

132
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just horrible.</v>

133
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:29.261
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't be worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care like round heads smile,</v>

134
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.610
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of shuffling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a person as far as your concern </v>

135
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.160
<v Speaker 1>is just irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it was higher resolution it </v>

136
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just need the bare bones,</v>

137
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dang your perceptions on.</v>

138
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you watch this drawing that's been </v>

139
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 1>oakeel beautiful drawings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animated in a sequence.</v>

140
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't watching something real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching a pure construction and </v>

141
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 1>then you think about the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's completely absurd.</v>

142
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Everything about it is observed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

143
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.730
<v Speaker 1>well one of the characters is a bug and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he turns out to be like the conscience </v>

144
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.591
<v Speaker 1>and so what the hell is up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another character is this </v>

145
00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:17.261
<v Speaker 1>puppet Marionette and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow he gets free of his strings and </v>

146
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>then goes on this adventure and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>

147
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 1>And then he gets enticed into various </v>
<v Speaker 1>nefarious places by a Fox and a cat.</v>

148
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And then he rescues his father from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whale and you don't even know I was </v>

149
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 1>father God in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

150
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:36.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like the last time you see his </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

151
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:41.141
<v Speaker 1>he was in a rainstorm and the next thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens is he's in a whale and </v>

152
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:41.380
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

153
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all makes sense.</v>

154
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

155
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

156
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 1>How does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

157
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:53.240
<v Speaker 1>the answer is you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that's so cool.</v>

158
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what you're,</v>

159
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Watch it and you're interested in </v>

160
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.190
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see what the hell happens to</v>

161
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 1>this puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see if he ends up becoming a</v>

162
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>real boy because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's seems important.</v>

163
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to say,</v>

164
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:12.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's Pinocchio.</v>

165
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

166
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:21.921
<v Speaker 1>that's a stupid question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly a stupid question because </v>

167
00:09:23.711 --> 00:09:25.810
<v Speaker 1>the answer is it depends what you mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>by true</v>

168
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.340
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

169
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.530
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me what you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean</v>

170
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 2>when you</v>

171
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 1>say that something's true and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason it's not obvious is because </v>

172
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>we have this idea in our society and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

173
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a very profound idea and that idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the ultimate truth is scientific</v>

174
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:55.891
<v Speaker 1>truth that that tells us that about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of the world and it does that in </v>

175
00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>a final way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense there is no brooking any </v>

176
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.191
<v Speaker 1>arguments about it and the physicists </v>
<v Speaker 1>have got it right and that's why they </v>

177
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:07.450
<v Speaker 1>can make hydrogen bombs and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good demonstration of their being</v>

178
00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:12.451
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't act as if that's true</v>

179
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.790
<v Speaker 2>and you don't,</v>

180
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.340
<v Speaker 1>and you watch things and pay attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to things in are captivated by things </v>

181
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.480
<v Speaker 1>that aren't predicated on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions and it seems to me that</v>

182
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.720
<v Speaker 1>there is a problem of what the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>made out of,</v>

183
00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:42.721
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bigger problem and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem of how you should conduct </v>

184
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:45.160
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what you want to know.</v>

185
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.330
<v Speaker 1>People want to know that more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything because you need to know.</v>

186
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like here you guys are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

187
00:10:51.191 --> 00:10:52.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

188
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you know more than others,</v>

189
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.960
<v Speaker 1>but you're at the beginning of your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and life is very complex and chaotic and</v>

190
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.030
<v Speaker 1>it isn't exactly obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

191
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of relationship you should </v>

192
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.741
<v Speaker 1>form or what sort of character you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should develop or what you're going to </v>

193
00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:09.250
<v Speaker 1>do for a job or how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the meaning of life?</v>

194
00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:11.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the meaning of life?</v>

195
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

196
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.570
<v Speaker 1>people come to university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least many of them and that's kind of</v>

197
00:11:16.571 --> 00:11:17.620
<v Speaker 1>what they want to find out.</v>
