1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Citizens have the inalienable right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit from the results of their own </v>

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Labor.</v>

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a conservative truism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't because you,</v>

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>because you're goodhearted and you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to have money.</v>

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>It's because they'll work if you let </v>
<v Speaker 1>them benefit from the work and you want </v>

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>them to work because if they work then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do things that you need.</v>

9
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>It's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's self interest and it's the right </v>

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>kind of self interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you work hard,</v>

11
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>it's like great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have your money,</v>

12
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you hear people all the time talking</v>

13
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>about how corrupt our society is and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one percent,</v>

14
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupies this pinnacle position.</v>

15
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one percent turns over pretty damn </v>

16
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>fast just so you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have about a 10 percent chance of</v>

17
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>spending at least one year in the top.</v>

18
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>One percent chance during your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's right.</v>

19
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be higher than that,</v>

20
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

21
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>The one percent is stable as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena,</v>

22
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>but it turns over very rapidly in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of who occupies it,</v>

23
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>and it's the same in every society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wealth is always distributed </v>

24
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>inequitably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural law.</v>

25
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>You can look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was discovered by a guy named Wilfred</v>

26
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Prieto back in the late 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds.</v>

27
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Goods tend to dominate to distribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves inequitably.</v>

28
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 1>It can be a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that there's </v>

29
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.901
<v Speaker 1>something fundamentally corrupt about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the social structure that's driving it </v>

30
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:24.261
<v Speaker 1>in that direction and like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want some filthy rich geniuses</v>

31
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:29.331
<v Speaker 1>lying around like maybe you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me look at what Elon Musk is doing </v>

32
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:32.691
<v Speaker 1>for God sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he should have 10 times as much </v>

33
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:32.691
<v Speaker 1>money as he has.</v>

34
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>He's going to launch a rocket every five</v>
<v Speaker 1>days to Mars in the next 10 years,</v>

35
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to wipe out fossil fuel cars </v>

36
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 1>and he might do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to revolutionize the </v>

37
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 1>transportation system and he might do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

38
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>He wants to put us on the damn solar </v>
<v Speaker 1>grid with his new batteries and he might</v>

39
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

40
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a couple of billion dollars.</v>

41
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Well God only knows what he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce with that.</v>

42
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously there's going to be some </v>

43
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be some corrupt rich </v>

44
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>plutocrats who do nothing but smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigars and snort cocaine.</v>

45
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to live very long </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

46
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>but there's lots of people out there who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the money they have because they </v>

47
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>would really like to do interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative things with it.</v>

48
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Not because they're interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering more,</v>

49
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper money to stuff in their mattress </v>

50
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>and to like to feel the smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smooth delight of gold coins between</v>

51
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>their fingers before they go to bed.</v>

52
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of attitude is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards people who've made their </v>

53
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.230
<v Speaker 1>fortune?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>you think that about Steve Jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about Bill Gates.</v>

55
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good God,</v>

56
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how those people make a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money,</v>

57
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God they were around.</v>

58
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:40.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've given us some tools that are </v>

59
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:40.731
<v Speaker 1>just absolutely unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

60
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe we could leave the jealousy of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful behind for a while and notice</v>

61
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:49.911
<v Speaker 1>now and then that some of the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to where they are actually deserved </v>

62
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>to get to where they are and we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be thankful that they exist.</v>

63
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.690
<v Speaker 1>That would be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little gratitude and that's a good </v>

64
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.721
<v Speaker 1>conservative value to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is more noble to teach young people </v>

65
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.070
<v Speaker 1>about responsibilities down about </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

66
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a good conservative message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have a son or you have a </v>

67
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>daughter and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody well grow up.</v>

68
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Stand on your own two feet and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>something of yourself right so that I </v>

69
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.411
<v Speaker 1>can be proud of you when you come over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that may be your useful in a </v>

70
00:03:19.411 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like pick up your damn load and,</v>

71
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shoulder it and do something useful.</v>

72
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.610
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and forget about your damn rights for </v>

73
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.681
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about what it is that you </v>

74
00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:34.021
<v Speaker 1>should be doing to benefit yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family and society and you'll find </v>

75
00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>some purpose in your life because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

76
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:41.251
<v Speaker 1>that's a counter position to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetrators of the endless rights </v>

78
00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>buffet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as we give you enough rights,</v>

80
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Free.</v>

81
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

82
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure you'll drown in a sea of chaos.</v>

83
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's happening to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>now too.</v>

84
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.190
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why young people are so </v>

85
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.190
<v Speaker 1>hungry to have someone talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>about responsibilities.</v>

86
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radical change should be viewed with </v>

87
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.831
<v Speaker 1>suspicion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in a time of radical </v>

88
00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:04.831
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

89
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.440
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a time in the history</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world where things are changing </v>

90
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>as fast as they are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only are they changing fast,</v>

91
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.210
<v Speaker 1>the rate at which they're changing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing.</v>

92
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:19.211
<v Speaker 1>Like we're moving fast forward at such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate that it's unbelievable.</v>

93
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 1>You can't even keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what discipline you're in.</v>

94
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not so bad to have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people putting their feet in the ground.</v>

95
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>They're digging their heels in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

96
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>we got a lot to swallow already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a lot to chew on and Digest.</v>

97
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's not muck about with everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's worked so far,</v>

98
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.290
<v Speaker 1>what has worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not such a bad idea for people to have </v>

99
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.610
<v Speaker 1>long term families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

100
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>We could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try to support the family.</v>

101
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.190
<v Speaker 1>We could even say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try to support the traditional </v>

102
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.190
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

103
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe boys and girls need role models of</v>

104
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>each sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a terrible thing to say,</v>

105
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:59.491
<v Speaker 1>but it is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly the case too that intact </v>

106
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:03.301
<v Speaker 1>two parent families have children that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrive more than broken families and </v>

107
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>broken families or a catastrophe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

108
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

109
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't stay with someone that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get along with,</v>

110
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:10.150
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

111
00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

112
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Except that there is no one that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever going to find to stay with it.</v>

113
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get along with all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

114
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>especially in your shoddy condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you're lucky that anybody.</v>

115
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:24.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lucky that anybody will put up </v>

116
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:24.331
<v Speaker 1>with him for a week much less your whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

117
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:29.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like the point of marriage is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough it out and you don't tough it out </v>

118
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.010
<v Speaker 1>for your happiness.</v>

119
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.870
<v Speaker 1>That's not what you're in there for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your tough it out so that you have </v>

120
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>someone to tie the rope of your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>together with.</v>

121
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.140
<v Speaker 1>You have a chance to tie the rope of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life together with the rope of </v>

122
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>someone else's life and to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong and to make a place that children</v>

123
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:47.071
<v Speaker 1>can have some security and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouragement and thereby contribute to </v>

124
00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 1>the future and pay for the miracle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your birth and your own raising.</v>

125
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:55.531
<v Speaker 1>That's why you get married and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no reason that conservatives can stand </v>

126
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

127
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>we're willing to tolerate alternative </v>
<v Speaker 1>family arrangements,</v>

128
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.880
<v Speaker 1>but when you start making the claim that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditional family unit is just </v>

129
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>another construct and that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>something fundamental to our polity,</v>

130
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've taken your damn argument too far.</v>

131
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no evidence whatsoever for that</v>

132
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 1>claim and there's plenty of counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

133
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>one of the things the postmodernists </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically say is,</v>

135
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you stand up for something,</v>

136
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you're also standing against something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

137
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>

138
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up for things.</v>

139
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is something that conservatives</v>

140
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>could agree on that we could stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

141
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>it's the nuclear family now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly how that's gonna play out.</v>

142
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's nothing to.</v>

143
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not anything to be ashamed of to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

144
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.180
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of looks like that structures </v>

145
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.180
<v Speaker 1>work quite well for the entire duration </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mankind.</v>

146
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe we mess with it at our </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparel.</v>

147
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government,</v>

148
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>local and distant should leave people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own devices as much as possible.</v>

149
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

150
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.470
<v Speaker 1>part of it's just humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'd rather that there was a </v>

151
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>million of you out there making your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid mistakes so that maybe a thousand</v>

152
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:16.061
<v Speaker 1>of you can get it right then for one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to impose their view on everyone and</v>

153
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>risk getting it catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong for everyone at the same time.</v>

154
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's really the alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a social scientist,</v>

155
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:26.250
<v Speaker 1>like I mean an actual scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean a bloody idiot log.</v>

156
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that you learned very </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly,</v>

157
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do a simple experiment.</v>

158
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:32.650
<v Speaker 1>You think you're going to predict some </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of human behavior,</v>

159
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.660
<v Speaker 1>so here's my hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put people in this </v>

160
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 1>experimental situation and this is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do,</v>

161
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 1>and then you run the experiment and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

162
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.520
<v Speaker 1>They do something completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find out that even though what you </v>

163
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 1>have them do is really simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a clue what they're up to</v>

164
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.050
<v Speaker 1>and that's just a tiny little controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment about one little tiny thing </v>

165
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.810
<v Speaker 1>and you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

166
00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 1>one of the great advantages to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative philosophy is that it's </v>

167
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's humble from,</v>

168
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:08.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of social </v>

169
00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:08.921
<v Speaker 1>experimentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

170
00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not like everything's great and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should just continue going the way we're</v>

171
00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:11.130
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

172
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything isn't as broken as it might </v>

173
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.401
<v Speaker 1>be and I'm kind of stupid and blind and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all I have is a bat and probably hitting</v>

174
00:08:19.951 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>it isn't going to make it any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

175
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll do is shatter it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the conservative says it's </v>

176
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>working</v>

177
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 1>quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sneak away.</v>

178
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'll keep working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a perfectly reasonable </v>

179
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.081
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously sometimes things have to </v>

180
00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:40.271
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the conservative can come up and </v>

181
00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:42.371
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be thinking that you have so much </v>

182
00:08:42.371 --> 00:08:45.431
<v Speaker 1>evidence that what you're doing is right</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that it will have the outcome that </v>

183
00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:45.990
<v Speaker 1>you expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a quick story,</v>

184
00:08:45.991 --> 00:08:50.991
<v Speaker 1>and this was told to me by a woman named</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joan mccord who was one of the world's </v>

185
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>first female criminologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

186
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 1>a phd from temple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of a genius level,</v>

187
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 1>genius level person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very tremendous integrity,</v>

188
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough,</v>

189
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.380
<v Speaker 1>tough person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She did a study in a place called </v>

190
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.841
<v Speaker 1>Somerville in the United States in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts in the 19 thirties famous </v>

191
00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:05.841
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so here is the deal.</v>

192
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.940
<v Speaker 1>They'd identified a bunch of inner city </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids in rough neighborhoods and felt </v>

193
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>that they were more likely to be on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal track,</v>

194
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 1>criminal antisocial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undereducated,</v>

195
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.060
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

196
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 1>the whole dismal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wretched,</v>

197
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 1>underclass phenomena thing was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they thought,</v>

198
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:20.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do an intervention.</v>

199
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:25.941
<v Speaker 1>Let's set up programs to help these kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see if we can see if we can change </v>

200
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:27.790
<v Speaker 1>their developmental pathway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

201
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.880
<v Speaker 1>they designed to find study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

202
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I had the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get the details wrong,</v>

203
00:09:35.061 --> 00:09:37.100
<v Speaker 1>but I got the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the story right.</v>

204
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.640
<v Speaker 1>They had the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made them more literate.</v>

205
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.550
<v Speaker 1>They educated the more they had their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents take training courses.</v>

206
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.700
<v Speaker 1>They did social skills training like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they did all sorts of things to try to </v>

207
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.021
<v Speaker 1>make the kids' lives turn out better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to top it all off because the kids were </v>

208
00:09:53.021 --> 00:09:55.730
<v Speaker 1>stuck in the inner city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took them all out to summer camp for a</v>

209
00:09:55.731 --> 00:10:00.731
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and so they could get away from </v>

210
00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:03.191
<v Speaker 1>the city and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy the countryside and have a little </v>

211
00:10:03.191 --> 00:10:03.770
<v Speaker 1>bit of a vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little taste of a higher quality life.</v>

212
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>

213
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's thrilled with the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

214
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.420
<v Speaker 1>The kids are having a great time at </v>
<v Speaker 1>camp.</v>

215
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.340
<v Speaker 1>The counselors do thrilled the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists.</v>

216
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.780
<v Speaker 1>They think they're doing a wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

217
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's working beautifully.</v>

218
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Except then they did the data analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what happened?</v>

219
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.840
<v Speaker 1>The kids in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the treatment group,</v>

220
00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:21.980
<v Speaker 1>there was a control group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

221
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:24.470
<v Speaker 1>That didn't get all this special </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment randomly assigned.</v>

222
00:10:24.471 --> 00:10:29.471
<v Speaker 1>It was a very nice experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids in the treatment group did </v>

223
00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:31.190
<v Speaker 1>worse on virtually everything that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>measured worse.</v>

224
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Why</v>

225
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.440
<v Speaker 1>don't put out any social kids together </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same camp for two weeks during </v>

226
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

227
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is that the bad </v>

228
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:44.660
<v Speaker 1>kids teach the slightly less bad kids to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be worse.</v>

229
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a well documented phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why what happens in prisons </v>

230
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.751
<v Speaker 1>happens in prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do with criminals is the worst </v>

231
00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:55.140
<v Speaker 1>thing you could possibly do to criminals</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want them to continue to be</v>

232
00:10:55.141 --> 00:11:00.141
<v Speaker 1>criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for the fact that you keep them </v>

233
00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:00.141
<v Speaker 1>in there until they're old enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

234
00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 1>so they're less likely to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal activity,</v>

235
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.770
<v Speaker 1>but what was learned from the Somerville</v>
<v Speaker 1>study was don't be so sure your good </v>

236
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.221
<v Speaker 1>intentions are going to produce the </v>
<v Speaker 1>results that you intend because they </v>

237
00:11:10.221 --> 00:11:13.161
<v Speaker 1>probably won't and they probably won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasons that you never even </v>

238
00:11:13.161 --> 00:11:13.161
<v Speaker 1>imagined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other one was</v>

239
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 1>don't group bad kids with good kids on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the assumption that the good kids will </v>

240
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.430
<v Speaker 1>make the bad kids better because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't what happens.</v>

241
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 1>What happens is the reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you put two or three bad kids with a </v>

242
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.910
<v Speaker 1>bunch of good kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the good kids get worse.</v>

243
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 1>The bad kids don't get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very well documented social science </v>

244
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.361
<v Speaker 1>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the reason I'm telling you the </v>

245
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:36.361
<v Speaker 1>Somerville story is because God who </v>
<v Speaker 1>could argue with that study,</v>

246
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:38.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like these kids were poor.</v>

247
00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:40.240
<v Speaker 1>They were struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to.</v>

248
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.880
<v Speaker 1>You want to lift them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to make their life better.</v>

249
00:11:42.881 --> 00:11:47.881
<v Speaker 1>You do this wonderful expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well motivated experiment and then you </v>

250
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:52.711
<v Speaker 1>run the damn data analysis and you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that there was one thing wrong with </v>

251
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:55.741
<v Speaker 1>your social intervention philosophy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand and you actually made </v>

252
00:11:55.741 --> 00:11:55.741
<v Speaker 1>it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

253
00:11:55.741 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>that's a and so Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joel Mccord,</v>

254
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 1>she spent much of the rest of her life </v>
<v Speaker 1>going around telling social scientists.</v>

255
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 1>When you run a social experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

256
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 1>the same thing when you run a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

257
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 1>especially on a large number of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially without their consent,</v>

258
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:15.210
<v Speaker 1>then gather the data and do the followup</v>
<v Speaker 1>study because it's highly probable that </v>

259
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:20.131
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that what you did didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work or maybe it even worked backwards </v>

260
00:12:20.131 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 1>and you'll never know that unless you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this study,</v>

261
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:26.310
<v Speaker 1>and so what people took away from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social intervention is types took </v>

262
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 1>away from that was whatever you do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your social intervention policy,</v>

263
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 1>don't run the study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

264
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the wrong lesson,</v>

265
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
