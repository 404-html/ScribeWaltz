1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that you all think,</v>

2
00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:03.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in control of yourself,</v>

3
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>but don't be thinking that that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>not right.</v>

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at how the brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>

5
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hypothalamus,</v>

6
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:13.150
<v Speaker 1>which is a really important part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

7
00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:18.151
<v Speaker 1>it basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it basically establishes the framework </v>

8
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>of reference and the actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the framework of reference within which,</v>

9
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>and the actions you take in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfill basic biological needs.</v>

10
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamus makes you thirsty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the hypothalamus makes you hungry </v>

11
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>and it makes you sexually aroused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it puts you into a state of defensive</v>

12
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:38.001
<v Speaker 1>aggression and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually also makes you explore and </v>

13
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>be curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that,</v>

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing structure.</v>

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.580
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

16
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>and it's really small and it's right at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the base of the brain.</v>

17
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could imagine it as something </v>

18
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.451
<v Speaker 1>that has tremendously powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>projections upward throughout the rest </v>

19
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:57.291
<v Speaker 1>of the brain into the emotional systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the cortical systems and all of </v>

20
00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tree trunk size connections,</v>

21
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically speaking.</v>

22
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>And then the cortex has these little </v>
<v Speaker 1>like vine,</v>

23
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>like tendrils going down to regulate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>

24
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it's,</v>

25
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>when push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

26
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus that thing wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

27
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:18.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get people now and then who have a </v>

28
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamic dysfunction and one of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces a condition called,</v>

29
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not dip.</v>

30
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:23.740
<v Speaker 1>So mania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's,</v>

31
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>it's like that doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It produces an uncontrollable thirst.</v>

32
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 1>And so what will happen is that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have this hypothalamic problem will </v>

33
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 1>drown themselves by drinking water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

34
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.940
<v Speaker 1>which you can do by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>and so they just cannot get enough water</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no stopping them,</v>

36
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

37
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.590
<v Speaker 1>no more than there would be stopping you</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were suffering from raging </v>

38
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.011
<v Speaker 1>thirst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a happy day when the </v>

39
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:52.011
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus is not telling you what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

40
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in such a civilized state that </v>

41
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

42
00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:03.801
<v Speaker 1>you're tranquil and satisfied and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>or less you can imagine yourself as a </v>

43
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.870
<v Speaker 1>productive well meaning entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But don't be thinking that that's what </v>

45
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:17.871
<v Speaker 1>you'd be if you were putting the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation because that's just not right </v>

46
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:17.871
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

47
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of times soldiers developed post </v>

48
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>traumatic stress disorder because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go out of the battlefield,</v>

49
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're young guys,</v>

50
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

51
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

52
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:29.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually is worse if they're not that</v>

53
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:34.431
<v Speaker 1>bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out because having a lower Iq </v>

54
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>is one of the things that predisposes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to post traumatic stress disorder.</v>

55
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:39.741
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go out in the battlefield and they </v>

56
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>see what they're capable of under </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefield conditions.</v>

57
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had been fighting wars for a very </v>

59
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years.</v>

60
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps basically have wars with other </v>

61
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the troops,</v>

62
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the juveniles will patrol the </v>

63
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>perimeter perimeter of their territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they find other chimps from other</v>

64
00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:01.551
<v Speaker 1>troops that they outnumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will tear them to pieces like in </v>

65
00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>chimps are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really strong.</v>

66
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And so when I say they'll tear them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces,</v>

67
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean that literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tear them to pieces.</v>

69
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.470
<v Speaker 1>And Jane Goodall discovered that </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally in 19 seventies and she </v>

70
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>didn't even report it for awhile because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was so shocked,</v>

71
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she kind of assumed like most followers </v>

72
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.341
<v Speaker 1>of Ruth's soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the human proclivity for warfare </v>

73
00:03:23.341 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>was part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That part.</v>

74
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>That was something that was a uniquely </v>
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>

75
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:27.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had something to do with our,</v>

76
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>our unique self consciousness or </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence or something like that.</v>

77
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>She had no idea that it was rooted that </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply,</v>

78
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:35.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

79
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>we split from chimps about six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>7 million years ago,</v>

80
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

81
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.760
<v Speaker 1>And so we were patrolling and territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were gang members 7 million years </v>

82
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

83
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.300
<v Speaker 1>at that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's minimum estimation because of </v>

84
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.371
<v Speaker 1>course that ancestor shaded back maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>$20 million years into entities that </v>

85
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>were roughly primate like and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>territoriality and the.</v>

86
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>And the proclivity to defend territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so deeply embedded in us.</v>

87
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

88
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

89
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the control center for our whole brain.</v>

90
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>And so there isn't anything more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to us,</v>

91
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:22.591
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then maintaining the match between what </v>

92
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:29.071
<v Speaker 1>we want to have happen and what other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are doing in response to our </v>

93
00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's that that's what we want and</v>

94
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.330
<v Speaker 1>as long as that matches maintained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then our emotional systems and I would </v>

95
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>say anxiety is probably primary in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>

96
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Our emotional systems remain inhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're on,</v>

97
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>they're ready like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a nuclear reactor.</v>

98
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Rods are on and the rest of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>dampens them down.</v>

99
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 1>But it's like if you don't want them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take time to start up,</v>

100
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want them to be on at a,</v>

101
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>at a 10th of a second's notice when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

102
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of why.</v>

103
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at a wild animal,</v>

104
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:06.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>it's ready to dark this way or that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a prey animal instantaneously</v>

106
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:16.591
<v Speaker 1>and it has reflex is built into it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that will respond way before your</v>

107
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

108
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to be walking down a trail</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you detect something snake like in </v>

109
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.011
<v Speaker 1>the periphery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll leap away before you even know </v>

110
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:33.150
<v Speaker 1>that you lapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because it takes a fair bit </v>

111
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.331
<v Speaker 1>of time to actually see a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by which I mean form a conscious </v>

112
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:37.970
<v Speaker 1>representation of the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe it takes a quarter of a second or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

114
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>or even longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't matter.</v>

115
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it takes 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No 20th of a set a 10th of a second.</v>

116
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about the damn snake is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way faster than that.</v>

117
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>It's really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing,</v>

118
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>and it coevolved with primates by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

119
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And so it can nail you like way faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you can look at it.</v>

120
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>So you have your eyes map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snake like objects,</v>

121
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>right onto your reflexes so that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes go,</v>

122
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>the eyes make you jump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they see after that's like,</v>

123
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now you can see that's no problem,</v>

124
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

125
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

126
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Alright now what I would say that what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we do is we live in a shared story and </v>

127
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>the story is a way of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and its way of acting in the world</v>

128
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:32.081
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that story has to operate within </v>

129
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:35.350
<v Speaker 1>narrow parameters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that's </v>

130
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.601
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily important to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is something I think that </v>

131
00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:41.981
<v Speaker 1>piaget figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Piaget figured out better than </v>

132
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:41.981
<v Speaker 1>anyone else.</v>

133
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I think he really got this right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

134
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that piaget was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

135
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>you never hear about how strange these </v>
<v Speaker 1>great thinkers are.</v>

136
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 1>But Piaget was a very strange guy and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a.</v>

137
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.660
<v Speaker 1>He was a hyper genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was offered the curatorship of a </v>

138
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>bloody museum when he was 10 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 1>because he wrote this little paper on </v>
<v Speaker 1>mollusks,</v>

140
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:03.941
<v Speaker 1>which parent was very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they offered him the curatorship </v>

141
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:04.610
<v Speaker 1>of a museum and his parents wrote back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

142
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not because he said he's </v>

144
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.140
<v Speaker 1>actually tad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was piaget man,</v>

145
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was a genius and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

146
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:17.660
<v Speaker 1>he was actually motivated by the desire </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reconcile science and religion.</v>

147
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.720
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was actually his entire motivation </v>

148
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>for what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd never hear that.</v>

149
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the case.</v>

150
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:30.010
<v Speaker 1>And so piaget was very interested in how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you produce structures that enable you </v>

151
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 1>to regulate yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you're like a kind of a,</v>

152
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.580
<v Speaker 1>a colony of strange sub animals that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to figure out how to get along so </v>

153
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.881
<v Speaker 1>that you can sort of be one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of learned that I would say </v>

154
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>between the ages of two and four as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being socialized,</v>

155
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how erratic two year olds are.</v>

156
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:51.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a blast and it's partly because </v>

157
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:51.551
<v Speaker 1>they were erratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're unbelievably happy and</v>

158
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 1>then they're unbelievably hungry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're really hot and then they're</v>

159
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:56.690
<v Speaker 1>really upset and crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

160
00:07:56.691 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 1>And then they're really scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an,</v>

161
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.420
<v Speaker 1>all of that is just untrammeled and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun to be around them,</v>

162
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're happy because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so happy that it's just,</v>

163
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:10.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever get to be that happy and </v>

164
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.511
<v Speaker 1>so it's nice to be around the two year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old because you can kinda feel that </v>

165
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.270
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of what the.</v>

167
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:20.230
<v Speaker 1>One of the horrible things about being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>parent is that you spend a tremendous </v>

168
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.400
<v Speaker 1>amount of your time making your child </v>
<v Speaker 1>less happy.</v>

169
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion is a very impulsive,</v>

170
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know because everybody says,</v>

171
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should be happy.</v>

172
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

173
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>when you're happy you're actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

174
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And so because happiness makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>

175
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>happiness makes happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says hey,</v>

176
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:43.751
<v Speaker 1>things are really good right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get what you can while the getting's </v>

177
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:44.690
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as a like,</v>

178
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:49.691
<v Speaker 1>if you're hyper optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manic will say it's like every stock </v>

179
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>investment looks like a really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock investment.</v>

180
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like you won't spend all your money</v>
<v Speaker 1>because look at,</v>

181
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:59.081
<v Speaker 1>there's those wonderful things </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and you could do such great </v>

182
00:08:59.081 --> 00:08:59.081
<v Speaker 1>things with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

183
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>you spend all your money and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>crash and you think,</v>

184
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life's over,</v>

185
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just,</v>

186
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I just spent all my money on all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>useless stuff.</v>

187
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 1>And it's all under the grip of </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>

188
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

189
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:17.781
<v Speaker 1>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're telling your kids to be </v>

190
00:09:17.781 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>quiet and settled down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't because they're making a lot of</v>

191
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 1>noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being in pain is because they're running</v>

192
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>around like wild baboons having a blast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and disrupting things like mad,</v>

193
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got kids,</v>

194
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>you got to settle down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:35.421
<v Speaker 1>like quit having so much fun and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of awful that you do that,</v>

196
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do.</v>

197
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's because the emotions and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations have to be brought into like</v>

198
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:46.830
<v Speaker 1>a relationship with one another within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the person.</v>

199
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 1>one thing I remember with my son who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite,</v>

201
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>he's quite disagreeable by temperament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually a good thing as far as</v>

202
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it brings its own challenges.</v>

203
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.600
<v Speaker 1>And so with my daughter when she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>misbehaving,</v>

204
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.870
<v Speaker 1>she was pretty agreeable and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 1>if she was misbehaving I can basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>just look at her and then she'd quit,</v>

206
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my son,</v>

207
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:13.430
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just nothing.</v>

208
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

209
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not going to go anywhere,</v>

210
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
