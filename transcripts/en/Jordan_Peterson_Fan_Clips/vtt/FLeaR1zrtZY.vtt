1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that the Auschwitz </v>
<v Speaker 1>guards used to do to the prisoners,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.080
<v Speaker 1>and this is very telling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at Auschwitz there was a sign that </v>

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>said work will make you free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a little joke.</v>

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Not really a very funny joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>it's the kind of joke that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.210
<v Speaker 1>say tannic is the appropriate term to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize and to dare to</v>

7
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>due to state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when now our sweats prisoners came to</v>

8
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Auschwitz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>they're already pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty rough shape.</v>

10
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:42.611
<v Speaker 1>They were in cattle cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd been separated from their </v>

11
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:42.611
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything had been taken from them.</v>

12
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:45.080
<v Speaker 1>They were transported for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were standing up,</v>

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>the kids were suffocating because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no room in that,</v>

14
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so packed in there.</v>

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.100
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have anything to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There weren't any toilet facilities of </v>

16
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 1>any sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like you got rid of 20 percent of</v>

17
00:00:55.611 --> 00:01:00.611
<v Speaker 1>the people just transporting them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the ones on the outside of the </v>

18
00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they froze to death because of course it</v>

19
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:06.011
<v Speaker 1>was cold and pretty nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they got to Auschwitz,</v>

20
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>the guards used to have this game that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would play.</v>

21
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530
<v Speaker 1>This is part of the work will set you </v>
<v Speaker 1>free thing.</v>

22
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>They would get a prisoner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take a prisoner who's already in </v>

23
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>pretty pretty rough shape and then have </v>
<v Speaker 1>them carry a sack of wet,</v>

24
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:26.060
<v Speaker 1>sold 100 pounds from one side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camp to the other.</v>

25
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think of a camp,</v>

26
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>you think of something like a football </v>
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>

27
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe something that big fences around.</v>

28
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way man,</v>

29
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>these were cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were,</v>

30
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>there were tens of thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>in these places.</v>

31
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.440
<v Speaker 1>So from one side of the camp compound to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

32
00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:41.990
<v Speaker 1>that was a good hike and that wasn't bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

33
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:46.160
<v Speaker 1>They had to get them to carry it back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and put it in the same place.</v>

34
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Now that's poetic and it's malevolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:01.791
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is you're harnessing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human compulsion to engage in useful</v>

36
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:10.971
<v Speaker 1>activity and demonstrating how </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely futile that is despite its </v>

37
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:18.501
<v Speaker 1>difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like a bad thing to do.</v>

38
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>People need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a parody of meaninglessness.</v>

39
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

40
00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>people need meaning in their lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>because their lives are difficult.</v>

41
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is to what end </v>
<v Speaker 1>should you devote your life?</v>

42
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And another question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

43
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 1>does it matter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matter is an interesting word,</v>

44
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 1>a because matter is matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but matter is also what matters.</v>

45
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that what matters is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more real than matter.</v>

46
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>At least that's how you act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is,</v>

47
00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:02.621
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there something you should be aiming </v>

48
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

49
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the question of the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

50
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.540
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that supposed to </v>

51
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.281
<v Speaker 1>happen when you come to university is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's the sort of question that </v>

52
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>should be addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can tell,</v>

53
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>and this might just be my more cynical </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

54
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>what I see happening to university </v>
<v Speaker 1>students generally speaking,</v>

55
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:26.191
<v Speaker 1>is that they come in clinging to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wreckage of their culture and floating </v>

56
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>with the pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those pieces are taken away by</v>

57
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.130
<v Speaker 1>professors who tell them that everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be deconstructed and no,</v>

58
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.040
<v Speaker 1>nothing has any real meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like when you're finally </v>

59
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.251
<v Speaker 1>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's when you're floating out on the </v>

60
00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:50.251
<v Speaker 1>ocean and you've got nothing to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>afloat with.</v>

61
00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're,</v>

62
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.070
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you congratulate.</v>

63
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that as useful.</v>

64
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me tell you a story.</v>

65
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I'm going to propose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

66
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:26.311
<v Speaker 1>and we'll talk about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you inhabit a story that the </v>

67
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>framework through which you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is actually a story.</v>

68
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>And here's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story is you're somewhere and you're</v>

69
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>going somewhere and even that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptual or whatever.</v>

70
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a gradient between where you</v>

71
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:43.891
<v Speaker 1>are and what were you aiming at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means no more really than you're </v>

72
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:43.891
<v Speaker 1>doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

73
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:48.091
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting there and hypothetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aiming for something better and </v>

74
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 1>so you're in a state of insufficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

75
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:56.161
<v Speaker 1>is the DNS insufficiencies change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're trying to rectify the </v>

76
00:04:56.651 --> 00:05:01.651
<v Speaker 1>insufficiency and you presume that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current state is less preferable to the </v>

77
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:05.701
<v Speaker 1>state that you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the way that you bring those </v>

78
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>two together is sometimes you can do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>through thinking,</v>

79
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>but fundamentally you do it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

80
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>You do it through acting in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's sort of,</v>

81
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the answer in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the mind body problem.</v>

82
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>You have a conceptual structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you implement it,</v>

83
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're implementing it,</v>

84
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.440
<v Speaker 1>not abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're implementing it through </v>

85
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.440
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

86
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the basic story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a very interesting story,</v>

87
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's the framework through which you</v>
<v Speaker 1>view the world.</v>

88
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:38.221
<v Speaker 1>So it's a value laden framework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you wouldn't be able to act </v>

89
00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>and you wouldn't know what to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a value laden framework.</v>

90
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>You look at the world through a value </v>
<v Speaker 1>laden framework.</v>

91
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>So then we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:46.480
<v Speaker 1>what is the optimal Value Laden </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework?</v>

93
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're going to try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

94
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Now I told you about the war that went </v>
<v Speaker 1>on between the communists in the West </v>

95
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.620
<v Speaker 1>and how that obsessed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that I really </v>

96
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>wondered about was what was this just an</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary thing?</v>

97
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like did the Communists,</v>

98
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>they had some axioms and we had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>axioms and if you're a moral relativist,</v>

99
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:10.580
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

100
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 1>who's to say which set of axioms are </v>
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>

101
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Or even who's to claim that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say that a set of actions one </v>

102
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>set is better than another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a moral relative,</v>

103
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>this claim and Puno Fair enough.</v>

104
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe this is just an arbitrary </v>

105
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.611
<v Speaker 1>thing and it's going to be settled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>force because that's how you settle an </v>

106
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:41.391
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary claim between two competing </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems where there's no room for </v>

107
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:42.810
<v Speaker 1>negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought about that for a long time.</v>

108
00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:47.811
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to know what the roots were of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marxist system and what the roots </v>

109
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.950
<v Speaker 1>were of the Western system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I surmised was that the western</v>

110
00:06:52.951 --> 00:06:55.680
<v Speaker 1>system was actually something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved.</v>

111
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the communist system was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationalist construction that was </v>

112
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.230
<v Speaker 1>imposed and they weren't the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I wondered,</v>

113
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's western culture grounded in and </v>

114
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.250
<v Speaker 1>is there any reason to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real in any sense?</v>

115
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what took me into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>study of the underlying stories.</v>

116
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.520
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental stories upon which our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

117
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I believe is based in some of those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very old.</v>

118
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you a Mesopotamian </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

119
00:07:25.651 --> 00:07:28.470
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the oldest stories we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you an Egyptian story.</v>

120
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Those are sources of our culture and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think those stories are grounded in much</v>

121
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:39.621
<v Speaker 1>older traditions and I think they refer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to something real actually real.</v>

122
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already told you that there are </v>

123
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.881
<v Speaker 1>different ways of conceptualizing real </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that my initial hypothesis,</v>

124
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.770
<v Speaker 1>presumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>axiom you might say,</v>

125
00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:57.771
<v Speaker 1>is that pain is the most real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I believe that is because</v>

126
00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:02.370
<v Speaker 1>that's how people act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can criticize that.</v>

127
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 1>You can certainly come up with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative conceptual framework which </v>

128
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.840
<v Speaker 1>the scientists have because they believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the most real thing is mattered.</v>

129
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we need more than one set of tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>to operate in the world.</v>

130
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.260
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

131
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.220
<v Speaker 1>So now I want to tell you what I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental constituent elements are</v>

132
00:08:29.831 --> 00:08:34.831
<v Speaker 1>of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I hope is </v>

133
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:40.381
<v Speaker 1>that this knowing this will make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>immunize,</v>

134
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.950
<v Speaker 1>immunize you against ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason,</v>

135
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 1>because I believe that ideology is our </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmentary metanarratives narratives,</v>

136
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.430
<v Speaker 1>and they have their power because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're grounded in the Meta narrative,</v>

137
00:08:54.431 --> 00:08:59.431
<v Speaker 1>but they only tell of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have power because they're </v>

138
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.871
<v Speaker 1>grounded in the fundamental narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so here's the fundamental narrative </v>

139
00:09:02.871 --> 00:09:07.200
<v Speaker 1>as far as the characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say we're going to say that people</v>

140
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 1>are prone to characterize the world or </v>
<v Speaker 1>social primates.</v>

141
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:16.431
<v Speaker 1>We're social cognitive primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we tend to see the world through the </v>

142
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:20.181
<v Speaker 1>lens of a social creature and so and </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because we're concerned with </v>

143
00:09:20.181 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 1>acting in the world and the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly other people.</v>

144
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Then we conceptualize the ground of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure for action in </v>

145
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 1>characterological terms.</v>

146
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:38.330
<v Speaker 1>So the most fundamental reality is chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaos is what you don't understand </v>

147
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 1>it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even conceptualize it.</v>

148
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.590
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come into contact with it in bits </v>

149
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 1>and pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the twin towers fell,</v>

150
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:56.520
<v Speaker 1>when the twin towers fell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos reigned for a few days.</v>

151
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Everyone was shellshocked and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

152
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.650
<v Speaker 1>And Chaos is what you experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When your story falls apart,</v>

153
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>and that's a descent to the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

154
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.330
<v Speaker 1>And basically you live in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in chaos and order is where when you do </v>

155
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 1>what you think you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to have happen happens,</v>

156
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:22.550
<v Speaker 1>that's ordered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's explored territory and chaos is </v>

157
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.761
<v Speaker 1>when you do what you're supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get what you want and it doesn't </v>

158
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:30.291
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that place that you're </v>

159
00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:30.291
<v Speaker 1>magically in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that happens,</v>

160
00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:34.251
<v Speaker 1>that's chaos and it has different depths</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say it reaches all the way to </v>

161
00:10:34.251 --> 00:10:38.991
<v Speaker 1>hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that usually happens when your life </v>

162
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:41.991
<v Speaker 1>falls apart very badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're down in that chaos and you </v>

163
00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:45.981
<v Speaker 1>realized that it was your fault and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did something wrong and that you </v>

164
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 1>knew it and you ignored it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst form of chaos.</v>
