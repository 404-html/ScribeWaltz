1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Breast is this positive study?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>it's maps of meaning positive psych.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not that.</v>

3
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Why might you be villainous?</v>

4
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

5
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 1>because you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

6
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>You can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually an offshoot of empathy.</v>

7
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>This is something that took me decades </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out.</v>

8
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I figured it out when I was studying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book of Genesis because in the book of </v>

9
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.761
<v Speaker 1>Genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people become self conscious and they </v>

10
00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:48.761
<v Speaker 1>immediately have the knowledge of good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil.</v>

11
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

12
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:55.961
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is the relationship </v>

13
00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:55.961
<v Speaker 1>between that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then really I tell you,</v>

14
00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:59.741
<v Speaker 1>I thought about that like for 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to puzzle that out and then I </v>

15
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>realized what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're self conscious,</v>

16
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can conceptualize yourself as being </v>

17
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>you know that you are and you know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like and you know what hurts you </v>

18
00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>and what doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as soon as you know what hurts you,</v>

19
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>you know what hurts her,</v>

20
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the knowledge of good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil that comes along with being self </v>

21
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.431
<v Speaker 1>conscious as this is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishes human beings from every </v>

22
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:31.130
<v Speaker 1>other animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know a lion will eat you,</v>

23
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really want to tear you </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart slowly,</v>

24
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.950
<v Speaker 1>just for the fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>it eats you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wants to eat you and you,</v>

26
00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could call that evil it socks,</v>

27
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:46.271
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but animals are beyond good and evil in </v>

28
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:46.490
<v Speaker 1>that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human beings,</v>

29
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:51.491
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can aim our malevolence and we're </v>

30
00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:51.491
<v Speaker 1>really good at it because we can imagine</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

31
00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>this would hurt and if it hurts me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

32
00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>it's really going to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

33
00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And you need to know that you're like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you are like that.</v>

34
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't know you're like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you don't think you're like that,</v>

35
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.880
<v Speaker 1>you're even more like that than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think because the people who are most </v>

36
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.790
<v Speaker 1>like that or people who don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like that at all and you have to</v>

37
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:15.791
<v Speaker 1>contend with that and that's why in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems of thinking the world is </v>

38
00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:20.891
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized as a battle between good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil and it's inappropriate </v>

39
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:24.740
<v Speaker 1>conceptualization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a medic conceptualization and</v>

40
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>the culture is the wise king in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrant and that's always the case and </v>

41
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.990
<v Speaker 1>you're always stuck with that because as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an individual with your negative side </v>

42
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.480
<v Speaker 1>and your positive side year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative side is the resentful side that</v>

43
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>is irritated that the limited conditions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being and the suffering that entails </v>

44
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:47.821
<v Speaker 1>and it's arbitrary and unfair nature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wonder you got that side has a case </v>

45
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:54.121
<v Speaker 1>to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not trivial in in the brothers </v>

46
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Karamazov,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that argument is laid out beautifully.</v>

47
00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>There's a character Alioscha who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monk,</v>

48
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 1>monastery novitiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not really a sparkling intellect,</v>

49
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:08.551
<v Speaker 1>but a very good person and he has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother Ivan and Ivan's a vicious genius</v>

50
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.170
<v Speaker 1>and Ivan just take silly Osha apart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly he does that by telling a story </v>

51
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky took this from a news story.</v>

52
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.570
<v Speaker 1>The news story was that this mother and </v>
<v Speaker 1>father had taken their young daughter </v>

53
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.430
<v Speaker 1>and locked her in the outhouse overnight</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was like 30 below and you know,</v>

54
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.450
<v Speaker 1>she stayed out there crying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming and froze to death and I even </v>

55
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>basically said to Lee Osha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.520
<v Speaker 1>a world in which that could happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>should not be.</v>

57
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>That's good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you can multiply that by </v>

58
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>millions of examples.</v>

59
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.800
<v Speaker 1>So the part of us that is opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and resentful,</v>

60
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.290
<v Speaker 1>it's got a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

61
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.840
<v Speaker 1>The problem as far as I can tell is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you act that out,</v>

62
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.140
<v Speaker 1>then it makes what you're objecting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

63
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be happy about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

64
00:04:13.221 --> 00:04:18.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people couldn't be consciously pursuing </v>

65
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:18.221
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes they can.</v>

66
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend a book called Pans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ram if you're interested in that sort of</v>

67
00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:27.281
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a book written by a man who raped </v>

68
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:29.771
<v Speaker 1>1200 men and killed dozens and burn </v>
<v Speaker 1>things down to the ground every chance </v>

69
00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:35.081
<v Speaker 1>he got and tried to start a war between </v>
<v Speaker 1>England and the US and who is aimed at </v>

70
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:39.131
<v Speaker 1>nothing but mayhem and he wrote an </v>
<v Speaker 1>autobiography at the request of a doctor</v>

71
00:04:39.471 --> 00:04:44.471
<v Speaker 1>who had befriended him and he tells you </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly what he did and why the story,</v>

72
00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 1>heroin adversary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adversary order and tyranny,</v>

73
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>destruction and creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the basic landscape and outside </v>

74
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:08.160
<v Speaker 1>of that chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so let's take a break.</v>

75
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Here's another way of looking at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

76
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.230
<v Speaker 1>The individual is the person who pays </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and explores and masters or </v>

77
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:27.510
<v Speaker 1>who looks away</v>

78
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.900
<v Speaker 2>and the</v>

79
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.170
<v Speaker 1>the person is still inhabits unexplored </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory and this is unexplored </v>

80
00:05:37.971 --> 00:05:42.110
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so wherever you go,</v>

81
00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:45.260
<v Speaker 1>there's you have two halves of you</v>

82
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.210
<v Speaker 2>that you have to contend with and</v>

83
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.510
<v Speaker 1>wherever you are with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the society with its tyrannical </v>

84
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:59.701
<v Speaker 1>and beneficial nature and this society </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense is that match between what</v>

85
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:05.531
<v Speaker 1>you're doing and what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to get that right </v>

86
00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>and then unexplored territory that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever and whenever.</v>

87
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.420
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing stops working and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly a geographical idea,</v>

88
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:19.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you think of explored </v>

89
00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:21.281
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of geographic landscape like </v>

90
00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:21.281
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the domain of an animal,</v>

91
00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like your house and you know that's,</v>

92
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely an element of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

93
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.830
<v Speaker 1>if you're in your house and a snake </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes into your living room and you're </v>

94
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.830
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

95
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 1>well that's an important difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between your house.</v>

96
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>One second to go in your house now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so your house can turn into unexplored,</v>

97
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory at the drop of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hat.</v>

98
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's because we live in space and </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and so the unexplored territory is </v>

99
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.000
<v Speaker 1>conceptual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a conceptual territory and it's </v>

100
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.270
<v Speaker 1>just wherever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when things aren't working for you the </v>

101
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 1>way they're supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

102
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.140
<v Speaker 1>and these are permanent parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>human experience,</v>

103
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.470
<v Speaker 1>which is why I think they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental characters in our </v>

104
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.470
<v Speaker 1>narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always you.</v>

105
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 1>There's some subject of the story and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that subject is an ambivalent person </v>

106
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.771
<v Speaker 1>with many different potentials and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always somewhere and with other </v>

107
00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:21.680
<v Speaker 1>people because that's our territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

108
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're social beyond comprehension</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

109
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:30.371
<v Speaker 1>even our primate ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of their territory was other </v>

110
00:07:30.371 --> 00:07:34.451
<v Speaker 1>primates and their brains and our brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>are specialized to view the world as an </v>

111
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.300
<v Speaker 1>aggregation of personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important to us and so we </v>

112
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>tend to view the whole world that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then unexplored territory.</v>

113
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you don't know what to do </v>

114
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.940
<v Speaker 1>and but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do know what to do when you don't </v>

115
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>know what to do peculiarly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rather nonspecific.</v>

116
00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>It's this generalized stress response </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens is you freeze,</v>

117
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the threat is enough,</v>

118
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.830
<v Speaker 1>then you produce a lot of cortisol and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of adrenaline so that you're bloody </v>

119
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:11.960
<v Speaker 1>well ready to move quick and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction you have to,</v>

120
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.200
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you pay more attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you do when you don't </v>

121
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.491
<v Speaker 1>know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is as you can </v>

122
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:21.491
<v Speaker 1>stay in that state forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

123
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what posttraumatic stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder is.</v>

124
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're just like that all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

125
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is it's a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>

126
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:34.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stay like that for any length of </v>

127
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:34.151
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get depressed,</v>

128
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:34.151
<v Speaker 1>you're going to develop an anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

129
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:38.960
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get old because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning up resources like mad.</v>

130
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your system is shunting everything to </v>

131
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 1>maintain that state of emergency </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation.</v>

132
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 1>And it's exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not where you want to be.</v>

133
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's partly why people are so prone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend their territories.</v>

134
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 1>They're familiar territory because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're familiar territory is invaded or</v>

135
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:04.791
<v Speaker 1>disrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they default back to the state of </v>

136
00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:05.070
<v Speaker 1>emergency preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like,</v>

137
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>that can unglue you if it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's profound enough.</v>

138
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you guys know this already.</v>

139
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people experience this most,</v>

140
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:18.471
<v Speaker 1>particularly when they're betrayed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone they have an intimate </v>

141
00:09:18.471 --> 00:09:18.730
<v Speaker 1>relationship with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

142
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>when they're lied to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's other ways.</v>

143
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.630
<v Speaker 1>The collapse of a dream or a vision that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been pursuing or an illness or </v>

144
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.951
<v Speaker 1>the death in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of other ways but be is a </v>

145
00:09:30.951 --> 00:09:32.520
<v Speaker 1>really good one because if you're with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone for a long time,</v>

146
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 1>you trust them.</v>

147
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:38.510
<v Speaker 1>You have a representation of your past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a representation of you in the </v>

148
00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a representation of them.</v>

149
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>You have a representation of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

150
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 1>You have a representation of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get betrayed.</v>

151
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:50.511
<v Speaker 1>It's like poof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the past isn't what you thought it </v>

152
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:50.511
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>and what about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

154
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 1>how clueless are you and maybe not at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all or maybe ultimately gullible.</v>

155
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:59.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it your fault or you know,</v>

156
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.840
<v Speaker 1>or you so clueless that you just can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect yourself or was the person </v>

157
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.391
<v Speaker 1>malevolent in some subtle way that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed to detect everything's up in the </v>

158
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:12.660
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good and this idea that human beings</v>

159
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 1>traveled to the underworld and come </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

160
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a really useful thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand because we do that all the </v>

161
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever we fail,</v>

162
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:26.391
<v Speaker 1>it's like whip down into the underworld </v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile where everything's in chaos </v>

163
00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe we sort ourselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

164
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:33.531
<v Speaker 1>we're back up and so one way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing yourself is not as order</v>

165
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.710
<v Speaker 1>and as not as chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as the thing that traverses between </v>

166
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 1>the two domains and that I would say is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mythological hero.</v>
