1
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.960
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to start talking to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Pinocchio a little bit.</v>

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you enjoy this,</v>

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I want to do it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to.</v>

4
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to put some.</v>

5
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to bring what I told you </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstractly down to earth and then you </v>

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.440
<v Speaker 1>can start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>do the conceptions that I've introduced </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

8
00:00:25.451 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they good for anything?</v>

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Did they help?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the order.</v>

10
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Descend into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reestablishment of order.</v>

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.330
<v Speaker 1>That's paradise lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Profane history,</v>

12
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>paradise regained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the classic comedy and that's the </v>

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>story of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is how do you manage</v>

14
00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a question you really want</v>

15
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.180
<v Speaker 1>to know the answer to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll go,</v>

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>you'll pay money weirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll line up and pay money to see a </v>

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.891
<v Speaker 1>story about that even if you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that that's what the story is </v>

18
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that actually</v>

19
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:07.660
<v Speaker 1>part of you doesn't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story's about.</v>

20
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>You know you have your cognition has </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple layers.</v>

21
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>You understand things that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you understand in ways that you </v>

22
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:20.390
<v Speaker 1>don't understand and you can tell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

23
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about Pinocchio a little bit,</v>

24
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 1>how absurd it is and that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

25
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 2>so we've been talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't do what they expect you to </v>

27
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 2>do it in the negative sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if the reaction is extremely </v>

28
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 2>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like something that click like winning a</v>

29
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 2>lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that,</v>

30
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 2>do you also go into the stress response </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you the same thing?</v>

31
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Not Quite the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question and we will address</v>

32
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will address that.</v>

33
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean winning the lottery is generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a good idea for people,</v>

34
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just too much.</v>

35
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>It's too much for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flips their lives upside down so.</v>

36
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>And they tend to at best to return to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their original baseline level of </v>

37
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

38
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:16.261
<v Speaker 1>something remarkably good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a lot better than something </v>

39
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>remarkably bad obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still can have that destabilizing</v>

40
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it depends on what elements of your </v>

41
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>life it disrupts it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's some,</v>

42
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>some in some sense you have a map that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're operating within in the world and</v>

43
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>that map is predicated on assumptions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different sorts,</v>

44
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>some shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some profound when the profound </v>

45
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>assumptions are devastated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge chunks of the map or invalidated.</v>

46
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.360
<v Speaker 1>And that can happen sometimes when </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically positive things happen as </v>

47
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

48
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.840
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental rule is the more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your axiomatic presuppositions</v>

49
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.310
<v Speaker 1>are disrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the harder it is on you.</v>

50
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe you quit your job because you</v>

51
00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:05.520
<v Speaker 1>win the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

52
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm off to the beach,</v>

53
00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to drink Margaritas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that'll work for about four days.</v>

54
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that for three months,</v>

55
00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a beach alcoholic.</v>

56
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:16.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's a real improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:18.330
<v Speaker 1>so it's not that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often too,</v>

58
00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.740
<v Speaker 1>if you take people out of their routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.860
<v Speaker 1>they just flounder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their circadian rhythms go.</v>

60
00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:28.440
<v Speaker 1>They don't eat properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what the hell to do,</v>

61
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is often why people have such a </v>

62
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.240
<v Speaker 1>hard time when they retire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to retire and relax.</v>

63
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like fire relaxed for two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would die,</v>

64
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need something to do.</v>

65
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I need to be engaged in something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

66
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.660
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio,</v>

67
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Disney movie and early one a </v>
<v Speaker 1>masterpiece.</v>

68
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going to walk you through it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to tell you what I think </v>

69
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.050
<v Speaker 1>it means and you can tell me if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that that's useful.</v>

70
00:04:03.051 --> 00:04:08.051
<v Speaker 1>And I'm only going to do that for about </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes today because I do want to </v>

71
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:11.111
<v Speaker 1>cover some of the details of the class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then next class we'll continue with </v>

72
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:11.960
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

73
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.400
<v Speaker 1>so the movie opens with the opening </v>
<v Speaker 1>credits which are carved wooden signs,</v>

74
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.050
<v Speaker 1>which is like a hint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:27.051
<v Speaker 1>because Japan was a carver and it starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this song which was actually quite </v>

76
00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:31.590
<v Speaker 1>a popular song and it's a bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

77
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poetry is particularly profound,</v>

78
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.410
<v Speaker 1>but it was a song that people liked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people still listened to.</v>

79
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:43.980
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sets the tone for the movie,</v>

80
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.070
<v Speaker 1>which is what music does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's really </v>

81
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.410
<v Speaker 1>interesting about movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really mysterious is that,</v>

82
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a movie,</v>

83
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:55.020
<v Speaker 1>there's almost always a soundtrack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:57.090
<v Speaker 1>If you go to a movie and the reason to </v>
<v Speaker 1>soundtrack it,</v>

85
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>it kind of feels empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like there's something missing </v>

86
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as if the music,</v>

87
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to a movie,</v>

88
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:04.830
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things you can't see.</v>

89
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.830
<v Speaker 1>The characters are only partial and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know anything about their </v>

90
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.310
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a low resolution thing.</v>

91
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 1>What seems to happen with the music is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it provides the emotional </v>

92
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.770
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the complex context,</v>

93
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:20.610
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's like a substitute for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>context and it,</v>

94
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.090
<v Speaker 1>it guides you in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your perceptions of the movie.</v>

95
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:26.190
<v Speaker 1>It gives you hints about what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

96
00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:27.200
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

97
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.520
<v Speaker 1>and the funny thing about that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we just,</v>

98
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.140
<v Speaker 1>we just don't have any problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

99
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

100
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course movie has its own track and,</v>

101
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.930
<v Speaker 1>and of course when there's a dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene and the music gets dramatic and,</v>

102
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.120
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't happen in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd wonder why we would accept it </v>

103
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.810
<v Speaker 1>in a movie and I think it's partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're willing to accept the </v>

104
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.860
<v Speaker 1>amplification of reality that </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a movie and in fact we find </v>

105
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:57.171
<v Speaker 1>that compelling and music is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that does that amplification the </v>

106
00:05:57.171 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>dramatization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

107
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 1>that's acceptable to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This song I find quite interesting.</v>

108
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to take it apart quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

109
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

110
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.800
<v Speaker 1>in some sense I feel foolish doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

111
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

112
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a childish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a childish song in some ways,</v>

113
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.080
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

114
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.920
<v Speaker 1>When you wish upon a star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes no difference who you are.</v>

115
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

116
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 1>there's some mysteries there people wish</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon stars.</v>

117
00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:32.820
<v Speaker 1>That's like a little ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

118
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Why do they do that?</v>

119
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

120
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.570
<v Speaker 1>and what exactly is the star?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another question because there </v>

121
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.870
<v Speaker 1>are stars that shine in the heavens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people who are stars.</v>

122
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.110
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

123
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.730
<v Speaker 1>why are people stars while they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually famous people,</v>

124
00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:05.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people that who attract a lot </v>

125
00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:06.310
<v Speaker 1>of attention and maybe there are people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have a lot of talent.</v>

126
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:08.340
<v Speaker 1>That's another possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

127
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe their models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean you know,</v>

128
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.760
<v Speaker 1>clothing models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although sometimes they are,</v>

129
00:07:12.761 --> 00:07:16.450
<v Speaker 1>but there are models for emulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what being a star means.</v>

130
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:18.820
<v Speaker 1>That's why people magazine is full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>

131
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

132
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>they're like heroes brought to earth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you know nothing about them.</v>

133
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:29.641
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know is their public persona and of </v>

134
00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:32.641
<v Speaker 1>course they're usually very attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that allows you to project upon </v>

135
00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:37.291
<v Speaker 1>them all of the things that would go </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with ideal humanity and so their </v>

136
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:42.331
<v Speaker 1>stars and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still why stars stars beckon in the </v>

137
00:07:42.331 --> 00:07:43.420
<v Speaker 1>darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

138
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>And their other worldly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

139
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:52.051
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not of this earth and I mean </v>

140
00:07:52.051 --> 00:07:54.520
<v Speaker 1>that technically because obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not of this earth,</v>

141
00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:55.360
<v Speaker 1>but I also mean it.</v>

142
00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean it phenomenologically I mean it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an element of human experience.</v>

143
00:08:00.371 --> 00:08:05.371
<v Speaker 1>So most of you are urban and so you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>not had the experience of perhaps of the</v>

144
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:09.850
<v Speaker 1>full night sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:14.851
<v Speaker 1>and that's really too bad because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>full night's sky is one of those </v>

146
00:08:14.851 --> 00:08:17.620
<v Speaker 1>experiences that actually induces all </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>

147
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder you look up there and </v>

148
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:22.680
<v Speaker 1>there's just stars everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

149
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.520
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at the edge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy.</v>

150
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:26.290
<v Speaker 1>That's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Milky Way,</v>

151
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:27.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the edge of the galaxy.</v>

152
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:29.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

153
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.440
<v Speaker 1>there's the edge of the galaxy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just so many of them and it's </v>

154
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.160
<v Speaker 1>such an expansive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking into infinity,</v>

155
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.910
<v Speaker 1>you're looking into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking beyond yourself,</v>

156
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.130
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

157
00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:47.131
<v Speaker 1>that produces a sense of awe in people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like looking at the Grand Canyon or </v>

158
00:08:47.131 --> 00:08:50.551
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're looking at something that </v>

159
00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:50.551
<v Speaker 1>transcends yourself.</v>

160
00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:52.170
<v Speaker 1>But that feeling of awe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be something that's,</v>

161
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.030
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a natural part.</v>

162
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Our response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.930
<v Speaker 1>you might feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when you meet someone that you regard</v>

164
00:08:59.931 --> 00:09:04.931
<v Speaker 1>as particularly admirable as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll feel that there's </v>

165
00:09:04.931 --> 00:09:08.091
<v Speaker 1>something transcendent about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's an interesting thing to think </v>

166
00:09:08.091 --> 00:09:11.481
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people you admire and there </v>

167
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 1>are people that you don't admire and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a clue,</v>

168
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:19.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a clue as to your value system </v>

169
00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:20.000
<v Speaker 1>and it might be not really something you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can even put your finger on.</v>

170
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you find this person </v>
<v Speaker 1>captivating,</v>

171
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:24.770
<v Speaker 1>you find this person and admirable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

172
00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 1>it's as if there's something inside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you that's looking for what's admirable,</v>

173
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that you are and that person </v>

174
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:33.610
<v Speaker 1>who's admirable has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a faculty,</v>

175
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>some faculty that you would like to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>for yourself.</v>

176
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 1>And so there are a model for emulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of how people develop.</v>

177
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like little kids often develop little </v>

178
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.250
<v Speaker 1>hero crushes on older kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.530
<v Speaker 1>not that much older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sort of the person that sort of just</v>

180
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:54.531
<v Speaker 1>within their grasp and then they follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>them around and imitate them and you </v>

181
00:09:54.531 --> 00:09:57.981
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're imitating what they find </v>

182
00:09:57.981 --> 00:09:57.981
<v Speaker 1>admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

183
00:09:57.981 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you find something </v>
<v Speaker 1>admirable as a hint,</v>

184
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 1>as to the structure of your unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>value system.</v>

185
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 1>And so you could think even as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>

186
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:11.010
<v Speaker 1>you can take well what qualities of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being do I find admirable?</v>

187
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask yourself that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

188
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.250
<v Speaker 1>You can't really think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a difference between asking </v>

189
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:18.720
<v Speaker 1>yourself a question and thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

190
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's more like when you're </v>

191
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.440
<v Speaker 1>asking yourself a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's contemplating,</v>

192
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

193
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.500
<v Speaker 1>what do I find admirable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's question you don't know.</v>

194
00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:31.320
<v Speaker 1>And if you're fortunate and this happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite regularly,</v>

195
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.950
<v Speaker 1>an answer will float up from wherever </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell answers float up.</v>

196
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

197
00:10:36.001 --> 00:10:41.001
<v Speaker 1>that's one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can write that down and you get </v>

198
00:10:41.001 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 1>some idea of what your ideal is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

199
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>and you have one likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what your counter ideal is.</v>
