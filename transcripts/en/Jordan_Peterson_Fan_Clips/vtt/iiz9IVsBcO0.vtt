1
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a big mistake that the </v>

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.880
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not trivial.</v>

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a big mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the only one.</v>

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another one.</v>

5
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>They don't like inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:17.141
<v Speaker 1>who does?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm against poverty.</v>

7
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like classic protest sign.</v>

8
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

9
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm against torture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's so obvious.</v>

10
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't get any Brownie points for </v>
<v Speaker 1>being against poverty.</v>

11
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>No one in their right mind is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>

12
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever watched the simpsons?</v>

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>You ever see the Republican Party in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>simpsons,</v>

14
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>they all meet in an old haunted castle </v>
<v Speaker 1>at night with like lightning bolts going</v>

15
00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:50.261
<v Speaker 1>off and there's a vampire and a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>texts and then even the Simpson </v>

16
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Republicans don't sit around in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>haunted tower at midnight saying,</v>

17
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need more poverty.</v>

18
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Here's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the postmodernists claims is </v>

19
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>that diversity is necessary and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it racial and they make it sexual.</v>

20
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:15.140
<v Speaker 1>They may get ethnic and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually technically incorrect by</v>

21
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:19.750
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I study individual differences.</v>

22
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>So those are the differences between </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

23
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.920
<v Speaker 1>I know the literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know about James Damore memo </v>

24
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.621
<v Speaker 1>right from Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote that partly because he was </v>

25
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.811
<v Speaker 1>watching my videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why he wanted me to interview </v>

26
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:36.331
<v Speaker 1>him and I'm a believer that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological differences in temperament </v>

27
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:41.281
<v Speaker 1>between men and women apart from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other obvious differences and that </v>

28
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:41.281
<v Speaker 1>they're actually not trivial</v>

29
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>and that they maximizing the societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have the most have moved farthest </v>

30
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>to producing egalitarian states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Scandinavian countries,</v>

31
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is that there's two </v>

32
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>reasons why men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different temperament.</v>

33
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.730
<v Speaker 1>One is biological and the other is </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental,</v>

34
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>and if you remove the environmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>variation,</v>

35
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 1>which you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you make the state egalitarian,</v>

36
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>you maximize the genetic variation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been demonstrated in the </v>

37
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Speaker 1>scientific literature over about four </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades and no one wanted it or hope for</v>

38
00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:17.161
<v Speaker 1>it and they weren't biased and looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for it because that was exactly the </v>

39
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>opposite of what social scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to find.</v>

40
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Because social scientists lean heavily </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the left and what they wanted to find</v>

41
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:26.401
<v Speaker 1>was you flatten out the state so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has equal opportunity and the </v>

42
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:28.690
<v Speaker 1>differences between people disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not what happened.</v>

43
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>The opposite happened that wasn't wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one was happy about it and no </v>

44
00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:39.331
<v Speaker 1>one's happy about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can actually tell when you've </v>

45
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.271
<v Speaker 1>discovered something in the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>science because you're not happy about </v>

46
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:45.811
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

47
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>if you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's a big difference </v>

48
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>between men and women in terms of trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

49
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.380
<v Speaker 1>compassion and politeness on average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are more than men and the </v>

50
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.061
<v Speaker 1>difference is approximately this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take random pairs of men and </v>

51
00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:09.421
<v Speaker 1>women out of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you had to make a back on who </v>

52
00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>was more agreeable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you bet that it was the woman,</v>

53
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>you'd be right 60 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>that's not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means you'd be wrong.</v>

55
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Forty percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's almost 50 percent of the time.</v>

56
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>So this is a big difference by social </v>
<v Speaker 1>science standards,</v>

57
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>but that's the magnitude of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

58
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>There are some differences that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

59
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>like the difference between men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's interest in people versus things</v>

60
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 1>is actually bigger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest difference we know,</v>

61
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the agreeable this difference,</v>

62
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:40.321
<v Speaker 1>but still they the shared attributes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women far outweigh the </v>

63
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.210
<v Speaker 1>attributes that differentiate them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could ask are there more </v>

64
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>differences with any groups or between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

65
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Now the postmodern answer to that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>

66
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need diversity by group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.550
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need different races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need different </v>

68
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.550
<v Speaker 1>ethnicities and sexual preferences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

69
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

70
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>There's moral difference within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups than there is between them.</v>

71
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't get diversity by crossing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>

72
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>You get diversity by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by selecting across individuals.</v>

73
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.310
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there is more differences </v>

74
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.951
<v Speaker 1>between groups said there is between </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals is actually the fundamental </v>

75
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>racist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the fundamental racist idea,</v>

76
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:30.961
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're Asian Oriental to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>the old word to discriminate the one </v>

78
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>type of Asian say from the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so different from me that there's</v>

79
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.870
<v Speaker 1>no overlap between our groups and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>also so different and there's so little </v>

80
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 1>difference within your group that now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know that you're not me,</v>

81
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 1>you're not one of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually know what you're like,</v>

82
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically that's incorrect.</v>

83
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how you get diversity.</v>

84
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity is actually necessary because </v>

85
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.621
<v Speaker 1>people differ in intelligence and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different temperament and the different </v>

86
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:10.531
<v Speaker 1>skills and so you actually need </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity because otherwise you can't </v>

87
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of all those differences,</v>

88
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 1>so you need diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need genuine diversity and like </v>

89
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 1>what would genuine diversity mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to put together a work </v>

90
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 1>team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want enough,</v>

91
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>you want people have sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity so that they more or less so </v>

92
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.151
<v Speaker 1>that you gathered together the </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriate talent to produce the </v>

93
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:33.500
<v Speaker 1>implement that's necessary to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly in the world.</v>

94
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a competence marker because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise your business is going to fail</v>

95
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>and so the proper diversity with regards</v>
<v Speaker 1>to employment is the diversity that </v>

96
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.910
<v Speaker 1>meets the requirements of the business </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

97
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's why you try to hire </v>
<v Speaker 1>people carefully and not randomly.</v>

98
00:05:53.481 --> 00:05:58.481
<v Speaker 1>Let's say third year our first errors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only a finite number of valid </v>

99
00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:07.801
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second error is that there are real </v>

100
00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:12.001
<v Speaker 1>differences between groups of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's more differences within the </v>

101
00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:12.001
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then between them.</v>

102
00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Third Difference is social status and </v>
<v Speaker 1>payment,</v>

103
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.970
<v Speaker 1>especially in a free democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist society is based more on </v>

104
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.130
<v Speaker 1>competence than on</v>

105
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.430
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

106
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would say that when a person in a </v>

107
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.840
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy starts to act like their </v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

108
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.940
<v Speaker 1>entitles them to power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that hierarchy has become corrupt.</v>

109
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Weinstein is a good example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

110
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he aksed acted like a tyrant.</v>

111
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.480
<v Speaker 1>What happened to him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good,</v>

112
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.170
<v Speaker 1>not good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he did was not good,</v>

113
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's an indication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's revealed.</v>

114
00:06:51.931 --> 00:06:56.550
<v Speaker 1>It's an indication that that misuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's competent,</v>

115
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.480
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets to have position because we need</v>

116
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>people who are competent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean you get to turn </v>

117
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>into a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you turn it into a tyrant,</v>

118
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.120
<v Speaker 1>then that overshadows your competence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go.</v>

119
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the definition of a functioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>state and our state essentially </v>

120
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.330
<v Speaker 1>functioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not perfect,</v>

121
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.500
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>

122
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.480
<v Speaker 2>but compared to what?</v>

123
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.430
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue compared to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical Marxist Utopia,</v>

124
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.730
<v Speaker 1>while compared to your hypothetical </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist Utopia.</v>

125
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're living in Auschwitz,</v>

126
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 1>but your but your actual Marxist utopia </v>
<v Speaker 1>is indistinguishable from Auschwitz,</v>

127
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.910
<v Speaker 1>so we're not listening to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison.</v>

128
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take a look at what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have and we're going to compare it to </v>

129
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 1>other places that actually existed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and geographically and by those </v>

130
00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:48.870
<v Speaker 1>criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

131
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.940
<v Speaker 1>is there another time you'd rather live </v>
<v Speaker 1>is another place you'd rather live,</v>

132
00:07:53.941 --> 00:07:57.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean a real place and in real time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you want to live back in 18,</v>

133
00:07:57.361 --> 00:08:02.361
<v Speaker 1>95.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in the western world where the </v>

134
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:02.361
<v Speaker 1>average person lived on less than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar a day.</v>

135
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:06.571
<v Speaker 1>In today's money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to live like those coal miners </v>

136
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.510
<v Speaker 1>like the answer to that is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have any sense,</v>

137
00:08:09.511 --> 00:08:14.511
<v Speaker 1>you should have some gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another problem with the </v>

138
00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:15.960
<v Speaker 1>postmodern neo Marxists like zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

139
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.900
<v Speaker 1>zero gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

140
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.910
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more pressed.</v>

141
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Of course you're oppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not impressed by the </v>

142
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchy for God's sake.</v>

143
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 1>So you have status in the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

144
00:08:33.561 --> 00:08:38.561
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a reward to your a high </v>

145
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:38.561
<v Speaker 1>status person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a reward.</v>

146
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 1>That reward should be shared equally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a badge of merit that you get.</v>

147
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the reason that in a capitalist</v>

148
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:51.161
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filthy selfish capitalists put you in </v>

149
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:54.861
<v Speaker 1>the position so they can extract maximum</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity from you and that's exactly</v>

150
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 1>why you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get paid,</v>

151
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>you get paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you keep working.</v>

152
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:03.381
<v Speaker 1>Why do we want you to work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because your work is actually valuable </v>

153
00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:04.950
<v Speaker 1>to us and so we're going to pay you so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't quit.</v>

154
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not a reward because you're a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

155
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not a privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what it is.</v>

156
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 1>You don't hand those things out like </v>
<v Speaker 1>merit badges.</v>

157
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.930
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The society is setup on selfish </v>

158
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.021
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pay people who are competent so they </v>

159
00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>won't stop striving because we want what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can produce.</v>

160
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>So you don't just distribute that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a gift.</v>

161
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gift at all.</v>

162
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's another place where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

163
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Social Status and payment is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the selfish desire of </v>

164
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 1>individuals and the group to extract </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources of intellect,</v>

165
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:44.151
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and industriousness from those who </v>

166
00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>possess them in excess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

167
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:47.400
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not 100 percent like that.</v>

168
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.710
<v Speaker 1>There's the incompetent people who rise </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the top.</v>

169
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.740
<v Speaker 1>You can fool people and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate them and you can act like a </v>

170
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 1>tyrant and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might say maybe the system is like 30</v>

171
00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:59.040
<v Speaker 1>percent warped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

172
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not much more than that because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can account for people's success across </v>

173
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.610
<v Speaker 1>life by looking at their individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>

174
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 1>intelligence comp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

175
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

176
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 1>We can do a pretty good job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicting their trajectory.</v>

177
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.260
<v Speaker 1>So there's error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of its health,</v>

178
00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:21.261
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes you've got what you </v>

179
00:10:21.261 --> 00:10:21.261
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get cut off at the knees or your</v>

180
00:10:21.261 --> 00:10:23.300
<v Speaker 1>family members do or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some tragic thing befalls you.</v>

181
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:29.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a randomness in the system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts for a fair bit of it and then </v>

182
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough,</v>

183
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 1>but not so much that the lights go off.</v>
