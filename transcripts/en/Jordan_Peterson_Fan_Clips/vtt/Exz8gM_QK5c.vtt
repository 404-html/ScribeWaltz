1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>So alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next borders are reasonable.</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.160
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The law is the border that stops someone</v>

3
00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>from stealing your</v>

4
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's an apple laptop,</v>

5
00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:29.971
<v Speaker 1>well it's the sort of laptop that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice warrior would carry and </v>

6
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.861
<v Speaker 1>then the social justice warrior is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be very irritated if you happen to </v>

7
00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:35.500
<v Speaker 1>purloin their laptop and then you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>point out to them,</v>

8
00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:40.501
<v Speaker 1>you know it's a border that protects you</v>
<v Speaker 1>from having that thing taken and they </v>

9
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:41.290
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

10
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 1>the borders should be open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay man,</v>

11
00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:48.031
<v Speaker 1>no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you hand over that laptop right now </v>

12
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>and everything else you own too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like borders and you can </v>

13
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.070
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the damn walls in your house </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't need doors on your bedroom</v>

14
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:56.071
<v Speaker 1>either and we can keep an eye on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever we want and so much for </v>

15
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.641
<v Speaker 1>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that really differs </v>

16
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:01.891
<v Speaker 1>between liberals and conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the left and the right is the </v>

17
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 1>right is in the right legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tight borders between things.</v>

18
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.260
<v Speaker 1>It's part of being conscientious at </v>
<v Speaker 1>every level,</v>

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>conceptually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually,</v>

20
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.830
<v Speaker 1>familiarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provincially,</v>

21
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>nationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right says,</v>

22
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's keep.</v>

23
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep the borders between things </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty distinct and the left says,</v>

24
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not because some of those borders </v>

25
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.471
<v Speaker 1>are in the wrong place and a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more free flow of information wouldn't </v>

26
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>be a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is that right,</v>

27
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.930
<v Speaker 1>but so are the Conservatives and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>why you have to talk.</v>

28
00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:26.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:29.080
<v Speaker 1>we've got some borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>

30
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some of them need to be moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>around a little bit and that's what the </v>

31
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.081
<v Speaker 1>political dialogue is for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that borders </v>

32
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:40.441
<v Speaker 1>themselves are a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a great idea because without </v>

33
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:44.431
<v Speaker 1>borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything Nash's into the same </v>

34
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>untenable state of undifferentiated </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and you can't live in that.</v>

35
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.110
<v Speaker 1>And so the people who are trying to tear</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the borders conceptually,</v>

36
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:55.111
<v Speaker 1>politically and practically what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want is the chaos that that would bring </v>

37
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:57.790
<v Speaker 1>the either want that or they're too </v>
<v Speaker 1>foolish to know that their pursuits will</v>

38
00:01:57.791 --> 00:01:58.660
<v Speaker 1>produce that.</v>

39
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.040
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

40
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.160
<v Speaker 1>let's be a little bit clear that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up and say,</v>

41
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>borders,</v>

42
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>they're okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got their problems,</v>

43
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:08.980
<v Speaker 1>but they're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make you a a,</v>

44
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>a bigot beyond redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you someone with some </v>

45
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.811
<v Speaker 1>sense and it's actually okay to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone with some sense limits on </v>

46
00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>immigration are also reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>we need to figure out what those limits </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and that's what the bloody political</v>

48
00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:29.521
<v Speaker 1>dialogue is for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it should be limited </v>

49
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:29.521
<v Speaker 1>to some degree is also reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

50
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:32.050
<v Speaker 1>why not just open the borders and let </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody come in?</v>

51
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason you don't do that is because </v>

52
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>a complex system cannot tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 1>extensive transformation over too short </v>

53
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 1>a period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you want immigrants to come in,</v>

54
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:49.261
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're the sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants who are likely to contribute </v>

55
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:50.950
<v Speaker 1>properly to the success of your polity.</v>

56
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And lots of immigrants do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

57
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I think the vast majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

58
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:57.970
<v Speaker 1>of entrepreneurs in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from the Indian subcontinent.</v>

59
00:02:57.971 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>bring them over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're highly educated,</v>

61
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:06.121
<v Speaker 1>they're extraordinarily productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make lots of new businesses and </v>

62
00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>then they pump money like back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad back in India.</v>

63
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that we have.</v>

64
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Our arms are open to everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration policy because it's complete</v>

65
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:19.111
<v Speaker 1>rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that means is you're not thinking </v>

66
00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:21.181
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when he hears a coded to that for </v>

67
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:23.641
<v Speaker 1>conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something I've been thinking </v>

68
00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:26.581
<v Speaker 1>about this a lot lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should not be assumed that citizens </v>

69
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:31.021
<v Speaker 1>have societies that have not evolved </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional individual rights predicated </v>

70
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>polities will hold values in keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>with such policies,</v>

71
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>so we could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

72
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that are not governed well.</v>

73
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

74
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.530
<v Speaker 1>and they'd be not governed well forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to me that means that there's </v>

75
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.421
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with the values that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>held collectively by the people who've </v>

76
00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>established those polarities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

77
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.200
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be naive and assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>merely because you move them to a new </v>

78
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.891
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to let their innate </v>

79
00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:04.891
<v Speaker 1>democratic longings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

80
00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work that way.</v>

81
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 1>So if you stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

82
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:15.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be a little cautious.</v>

83
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Let's make sure that we don't transform </v>
<v Speaker 1>our society so rapidly that we lose what</v>

84
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.340
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be careful about that.</v>

85
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.060
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that you're a morally </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible demon.</v>

86
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.190
<v Speaker 1>It just means that you're conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a reasonable position to hold,</v>

87
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.860
<v Speaker 1>so there's no sense in apologizing to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>

88
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you get to like hide </v>

89
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.710
<v Speaker 1>your bigotry under a mask of moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue.</v>

90
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the discrimination issue is quite clear </v>

91
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.080
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's associated with bigotry.</v>

92
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.100
<v Speaker 1>If you have two people who are applying </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a job,</v>

93
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>you should pick the one that's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualified and not pay any attention to </v>

94
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.511
<v Speaker 1>any of the other attributes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that have nothing to do with the </v>

95
00:04:58.511 --> 00:04:58.511
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

96
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

97
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I think basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we figured that out in about </v>

98
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Speaker 1>1965 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing it perfectly,</v>

99
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:14.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that much later than 1965 </v>

100
00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:16.140
<v Speaker 1>and our society particularly in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>is pretty damn open.</v>

101
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.320
<v Speaker 1>You can come in here and if you work </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard and if you're fortunate and you </v>

102
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 1>don't get sick and God smiles on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

103
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.380
<v Speaker 1>you can be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still prejudice on reasonable </v>

104
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.531
<v Speaker 1>prejudice and discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our society is not as the radical </v>

105
00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:34.731
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equity promoters have it structurally </v>

106
00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:34.731
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigoted,</v>

107
00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:36.690
<v Speaker 1>and misogynistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

108
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.520
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>

109
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.680
<v Speaker 1>there is a review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent review published and </v>

110
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean recent 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at that damn literature on </v>

111
00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:47.370
<v Speaker 1>unconscious bias and I knew the </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature to begin with.</v>

112
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.390
<v Speaker 1>There is no evidence that unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias can be measured properly,</v>

113
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.140
<v Speaker 1>not reliably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There also no evidence whatsoever that </v>

114
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.991
<v Speaker 1>if you do measure it and you can't very </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it does any better job of </v>

115
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:04.031
<v Speaker 1>predicting actual say bias and </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice.</v>

116
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Then just tests of attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the notion that our culture is </v>

117
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.621
<v Speaker 1>somehow structurally misogynistic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist and the reason for that is </v>

118
00:06:14.621 --> 00:06:19.091
<v Speaker 1>because of the unconscious bias of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters who are running it is is,</v>

119
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.930
<v Speaker 1>well maybe it's not wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you one thing about it.</v>

120
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.040
<v Speaker 1>It is not a scientifically justifiable </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition and that's what it's being </v>

121
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.301
<v Speaker 1>passed off as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I placed that firmly at the feet of </v>

122
00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:34.360
<v Speaker 1>the social psychologists with social </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology happens to be a fairly </v>

123
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 1>corrupt disciplined by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people who invented the Implicit</v>

124
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Association test which measures </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious bias because they have not </v>

125
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>come out publicly to the degree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have.</v>

126
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our test,</v>

127
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 1>which was for experimental purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is being misused politically.</v>

128
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:50.890
<v Speaker 1>You know your damn judges now because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal five feet,</v>

129
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 1>half to undergo mandatory unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias training before they can sit on the</v>

130
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:59.681
<v Speaker 1>bench and so you don't think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>political reeducation is because you're </v>

131
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:02.390
<v Speaker 1>not paying attention and there is zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that it does what it's supposed</v>

132
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

133
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And I would also recommend to all of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you happen to be in a workplace that </v>

134
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.871
<v Speaker 1>introduces diversity training or </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious bias training as a mandatory</v>

135
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.020
<v Speaker 1>requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell them in no uncertain terms that</v>

136
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you are not participating in a process </v>
<v Speaker 1>that deems you bigoted and misogynistic.</v>

137
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Without evidence of that being the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you trot off to the training,</v>

138
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Speaker 1>then you've just agreed that that's who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

139
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you've agreed to that man,</v>

140
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you'll be agreeing to a bunch of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to agree soon afterwards.</v>

141
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's time just to put a stop to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that.</v>

142
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>None of that unconscious bias retreading</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially not the mandatory type.</v>

143
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 1>People should be paid so that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>able and willing to perform socially </v>

144
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.630
<v Speaker 1>useful and desirable duties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

145
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.740
<v Speaker 1>So the radical leftists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they react to me this way.</v>

146
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you hold a position of privilege </v>

147
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 1>and power and I think first you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know a god damn thing about being.</v>

148
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea how I got to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>position of privilege and power and it </v>

149
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.970
<v Speaker 1>was no birthright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that I was a small,</v>

150
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.380
<v Speaker 1>like thick glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>

151
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.630
<v Speaker 1>non.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you call that?</v>

152
00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Athletic Child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:08:19.921 --> 00:08:22.680
<v Speaker 1>it was a year younger than my peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suffered plenty of.</v>

154
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trouble for my loud mouth and my </v>

155
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:29.030
<v Speaker 1>intellect when I was growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

156
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I had my struggles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not complaining about it.</v>

157
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 1>The point is is that you can't attribute</v>
<v Speaker 1>privileged to a class of people.</v>

158
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.460
<v Speaker 1>You know when you can't attribute power </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people who opt in to occupy a </v>

159
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.441
<v Speaker 1>position of competence and authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either there's some possibility that </v>

160
00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:46.920
<v Speaker 1>they occupied that because they worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard and were fortunate.</v>

161
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Let's not forget about that and had some</v>
<v Speaker 1>good social support and didn't have some</v>

162
00:08:51.211 --> 00:08:53.100
<v Speaker 1>horrible disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank God,</v>

163
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.460
<v Speaker 1>but you can't just make the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the position is there as a reward.</v>

164
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not there as far as a reward at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

165
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:06.231
<v Speaker 1>It's there as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person offering something valuable to </v>

166
00:09:06.231 --> 00:09:10.461
<v Speaker 1>those who want to pay for it and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason you pay for them isn't to reward </v>

167
00:09:10.461 --> 00:09:14.301
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't so that you give them a pat on </v>

168
00:09:14.301 --> 00:09:14.301
<v Speaker 1>the back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

169
00:09:14.301 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 1>you're a good person and you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve this position.</v>

170
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're saying to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>

171
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.730
<v Speaker 1>We find what you're producing a value </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we're going to give you what you </v>

172
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.220
<v Speaker 1>need in order to be motivated to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>

173
00:09:23.221 --> 00:09:25.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's not because we like you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because we.</v>

174
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 1>We respect your rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with equity.</v>

175
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:33.170
<v Speaker 1>It's we're trying to get every God damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing we can from you as fast as </v>

176
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.811
<v Speaker 1>possible and we're going to pay you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it and so people deserve their damn </v>

177
00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:37.410
<v Speaker 1>pay and the reason they deserve it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a reward.</v>

178
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:42.650
<v Speaker 1>It's because that's how you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive people to do things that are </v>

179
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.491
<v Speaker 1>difficult and time consuming and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps they wouldn't do on their own </v>

180
00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 1>accord to continue doing them so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit from it.</v>

181
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.040
<v Speaker 1>So the whole notion that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 1>we're awarding positions of privilege </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

183
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.210
<v Speaker 1>oppressive patriarchal types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we just have to get rid of </v>

184
00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.210
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enough of that.</v>

185
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 1>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolute nonsense.</v>

186
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing too is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 1>it's only been 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years,</v>

188
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 1>50 years since women had reliable birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

189
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're able to enter the workforce on</v>

190
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Moss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you man,</v>

191
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 1>we've produced a cultural revolution in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 50 years.</v>

192
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Women are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how bloody fast you expect </v>

193
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 1>something like that to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what makes you think that pushing it</v>

194
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:21.810
<v Speaker 1>really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to make it go any better.</v>

195
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell,</v>

196
00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:26.130
<v Speaker 1>we manage that transition about as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as we possibly could have.</v>

197
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.250
<v Speaker 1>We're still sorting out the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that you know this is </v>

198
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:35.091
<v Speaker 1>coming very rapidly down the pipes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that half of our corporate </v>

199
00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:39.111
<v Speaker 1>board members are women is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicative of the fact that we live in </v>

200
00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:41.100
<v Speaker 1>an unconsciously biased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misogynistic,</v>

201
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

202
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.120
<v Speaker 1>wrong not correct and so we shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing and this is happening very,</v>

203
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:53.121
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be sure Kathleen Wynne is going </v>

204
00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:53.340
<v Speaker 1>to be putting this in his policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly as she possibly can.</v>

205
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.520
<v Speaker 1>These equity demands to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is proportional representation of </v>

206
00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 1>every gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every sex,</v>

207
00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 1>every race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every ethnicity,</v>

208
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.200
<v Speaker 1>at every level of every organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

209
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.270
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do that by governmental </v>

210
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Fiat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

211
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.180
<v Speaker 1>that's not a society I want to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you and I can.</v>

212
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I can I quite certain that if you lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that society for any length of time,</v>

213
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.580
<v Speaker 1>you'd learned very rapidly that it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>a society that you'd want to be part of </v>

214
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:19.580
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
