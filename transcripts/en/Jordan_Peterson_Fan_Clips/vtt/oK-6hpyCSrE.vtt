1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>And so as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the working class needs a voice</v>

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.250
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious that they have one at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me at all</v>

6
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.030
<v Speaker 1>that the people who purport to stand for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the working class actually do so or that</v>

7
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>if they do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason they do so is because </v>

8
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 1>they're all compassionate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic and loving and kind and St.</v>

9
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 1>like I'm more convinced by Orwell's </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

10
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:41.891
<v Speaker 1>So back to the NDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people I met at the leadership </v>

11
00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:46.481
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them I had a fair bit of </v>

12
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:49.631
<v Speaker 1>admiration for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as I worked with the party over </v>

13
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:52.991
<v Speaker 1>about a five year period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this contradiction that Cape </v>

14
00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>kept emerging for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was that I didn't really like </v>

15
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>the low level party functionary activist</v>
<v Speaker 1>types.</v>

16
00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Like they just weren't personally </v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing to me.</v>

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 1>They seem peevish and resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at the same time I was going to</v>

18
00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about 17.</v>

19
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I got elected to the Senate on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>College Board of Governors.</v>

20
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:14.840
<v Speaker 1>And at that time Alberta was </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative politically right?</v>

21
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>It still is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they.</v>

22
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.150
<v Speaker 1>It was part of the progressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative empire because they ruled </v>

23
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Alberta forever and all the board of </v>
<v Speaker 1>governor members were basically </v>

24
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.540
<v Speaker 1>nominees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:34.541
<v Speaker 1>They were conservative nominees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these were conservative people and I </v>

26
00:01:34.541 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>was an NDP member and I thought when I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked for small business men too,</v>

27
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:38.120
<v Speaker 1>who weren't NDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>

28
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Speaker 1>They were conserved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never figured that out.</v>

29
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you about that in a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I had a bad case of cognitive </v>

30
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.511
<v Speaker 1>dissonance because actually turned out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I admired the people on the board </v>

31
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:50.180
<v Speaker 1>of governors and they were mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in grand prairie.</v>

32
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:52.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not a very big place and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>very old.</v>

33
00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And so if you were reasonably successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>in grand prairie,</v>

34
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you would inherited</v>
<v Speaker 1>your money from the arrest to across </v>

35
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 1>aristocracy was zero because there </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't one.</v>

36
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole damn town was 50 years old.</v>

37
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>So if you had any influencer or wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a small businessman,</v>

38
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>small to middle sized businessmen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd.</v>

39
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 1>You knew what you were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually admired these people and </v>

40
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

41
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.711
<v Speaker 1>that's not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mire them and I don't share their </v>

42
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>political views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's these other people with</v>

43
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>whom I hypothetically share political </v>
<v Speaker 1>views and I don't admire them at all.</v>

44
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.530
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I read road to Wigan pier and I</v>

45
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:31.760
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

46
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

47
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>They don't like the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just hate the rich.</v>

48
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same set of motivations.</v>

49
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist and you privileged </v>

50
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>compassion for the oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>

51
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:52.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you pushed to the margins?</v>

52
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing with all your hatred </v>

53
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>and your resentment and your evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't any of that.</v>

54
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really bad theory.</v>

55
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

56
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.110
<v Speaker 1>So you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

57
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.780
<v Speaker 1>you can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't buy it.</v>

58
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I still think that the people who stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak for the oppressed are in fact </v>

59
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.360
<v Speaker 1>motivated by empathy and sympathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their hearts are in the right place.</v>

60
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.730
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really buy that either because I</v>

61
00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:28.731
<v Speaker 1>don't really think generally speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a credible claim for someone </v>

62
00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:31.560
<v Speaker 1>to make that their heart is in the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

63
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Now you can ask that of yourself and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think your heart is in the right </v>

64
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well more power to you.</v>

65
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:38.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

66
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see the halo from here.</v>

67
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.100
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so given that you're just as </v>

68
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:53.301
<v Speaker 1>malevolent as your neighbor or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>even more so and that that's actually </v>

69
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:58.440
<v Speaker 1>pretty malevolent given the intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of human beings.</v>

70
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but wonder what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing with all those traits that you're </v>

71
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.570
<v Speaker 1>not admitting to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can.</v>

72
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.540
<v Speaker 1>You could even object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

73
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:14.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty pessimistic view of </v>

74
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:14.541
<v Speaker 1>human kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not by the way,</v>

75
00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:15.750
<v Speaker 1>it's just not naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

76
00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:17.970
<v Speaker 1>you could object that and you can say </v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

77
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight of moral authority is in fact</v>

78
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.220
<v Speaker 1>on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical left with those who identify</v>

79
00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>with the oppressed and who are working </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

80
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>their conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

81
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.900
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then let's say,</v>

82
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:41.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's give those people some power and </v>

83
00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:45.861
<v Speaker 1>if they're actually motivated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and empathy and desire for </v>

84
00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:49.521
<v Speaker 1>the working class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give them power and you give the </v>

85
00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:51.480
<v Speaker 1>ideas power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then as those ideas unfold in real time,</v>

86
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.150
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find out better for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class,</v>

87
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.400
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or did they get worse?</v>

88
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Because we could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could consider that like an </v>

89
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could consider the come proof.</v>

90
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what else you would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how else you would.</v>

91
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.920
<v Speaker 1>You would come to your decision because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just theory until you see it </v>

92
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.920
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

93
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Niches sat back in the 18,</v>

94
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.890
<v Speaker 1>late 18 hundreds that after he said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>God was dead.</v>

95
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose that would also mean the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that of suffering that I outlined</v>

96
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.500
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning that is that the basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Judeo Christian civilization,</v>

97
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.070
<v Speaker 1>the Guard was dad in the people had </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed him and that we'd never find </v>

98
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.610
<v Speaker 1>enough water to wash away the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a paraphrase.</v>

99
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:40.290
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got the basic message,</v>

100
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:45.291
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also said there'll be two </v>

101
00:05:45.291 --> 00:05:47.481
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that nihilism because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no transcendent meaning and a </v>

102
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:53.130
<v Speaker 1>move to totalitarianism because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't tolerate nihilism.</v>

103
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>He said the most likely pathway to </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism would communism.</v>

104
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't quite use those words,</v>

105
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

106
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.690
<v Speaker 2>he meant that</v>

107
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.240
<v Speaker 1>he words are close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said socialism,</v>

108
00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to use communism to </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing it,</v>

109
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.680
<v Speaker 1>distinguish it from Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Socialism.</v>

110
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 1>And he said that probably tens of tens </v>
<v Speaker 1>of millions of people would die in the </v>

111
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.190
<v Speaker 1>20th century as we played out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

112
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be worth it if we learn </v>

113
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>something from it.</v>

114
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Rough man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

115
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unbelievable.</v>

116
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:33.551
<v Speaker 1>Like I cannot figure out how in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world he knew that that was going to </v>

117
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially so far in advance.</v>

118
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:38.951
<v Speaker 1>But Dostoevsky knew the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote this book called the Devil's </v>

119
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>are the possessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could read that.</v>

120
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes about 150 pages to get going.</v>

121
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>But once it like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything snaps together after that.</v>

122
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>And then it moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's basically his prophecy about.</v>

123
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.330
<v Speaker 1>It's an examination of the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who had arisen in the aftermath </v>

124
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>of the death of God in Russia who would </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead the communist revolution.</v>

125
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant.</v>

126
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

127
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:10.061
<v Speaker 1>it's terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a great intro to soldier </v>

128
00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Knutson's Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which describes what did happen when </v>

129
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>those sort of people took over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

130
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at what happened after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution and we might say,</v>

131
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

132
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 1>how about we replicate the experiment a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few times because you know how it is.</v>

133
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 1>If you're running this scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment,</v>

134
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 1>you want to find out what something does</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you allow it to behave,</v>

135
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to just run it once </v>
<v Speaker 1>because while maybe there was something </v>

136
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>specific about those conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead to the outcome.</v>

137
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.180
<v Speaker 1>You want to generalize it across </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple circumstances.</v>

138
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>So we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

139
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 1>let's take this set of ideas and let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>let's run it on large scale over a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time in a variety of </v>

141
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.180
<v Speaker 1>exceptionally diverse cultures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

142
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.930
<v Speaker 2>So let's do that.</v>

143
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we can first start with the with </v>

144
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet people even now because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the 100th anniversary of the </v>

145
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.600
<v Speaker 1>Russian revolution are celebrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennon.</v>

146
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

147
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 1>That's like celebrating Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

148
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good,</v>

149
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that people can dare to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that that's okay means that </v>

150
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.450
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we look at history.</v>

151
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Landon was a monster and if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about that,</v>

152
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:36.651
<v Speaker 1>you can read Solzhenitsyn's writings </v>
<v Speaker 1>about lending because they communist </v>

153
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:36.651
<v Speaker 1>apologist say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

154
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:38.040
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't landing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennon was a good guy.</v>

155
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.830
<v Speaker 1>He was all motivated by love of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class.</v>

156
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:41.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

157
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.020
<v Speaker 1>his henchmen was stolen and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hansman is Stellan,</v>

158
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And and London was around during the </v>

159
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.300
<v Speaker 1>early collectivization and if you read </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he wrote,</v>

160
00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>you'll find out he is perfectly willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have any number of people die as long</v>

161
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:01.410
<v Speaker 1>as his ideological system could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought into big.</v>

162
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.730
<v Speaker 1>So there's no celebrating Lennon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no work,</v>

163
00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 1>cool young Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hip revolutionaries,</v>

164
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>and he's our idol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's none of that.</v>

165
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Not if you know anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not if you're decent,</v>

166
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 1>whether it's death of the Kulaks I told </v>
<v Speaker 1>you about that there was the Ukrainian </v>

167
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:22.930
<v Speaker 1>famine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's $6 million gone there.</v>

168
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.080
<v Speaker 1>There was the rise of the Gulag state </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it turned out that Russia,</v>

169
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union couldn't run on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles that it had that had had a </v>

170
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.300
<v Speaker 1>laid down as sacrosanct that just didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

171
00:09:34.301 --> 00:09:39.301
<v Speaker 1>So you had to enslave everybody and run </v>
<v Speaker 1>your economy as a slave state </v>

172
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.120
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

173
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.040
<v Speaker 1>And try not to kill the people into </v>
<v Speaker 1>gulags so fast that you can't suck some </v>

174
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.780
<v Speaker 1>productive labor out of them is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>death of tens of millions of people.</v>

175
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.840
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The estimates range from 15 to $60 </v>

176
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.831
<v Speaker 1>million and like we won't get too picky </v>
<v Speaker 1>picayune about the numbers because after</v>

177
00:09:59.841 --> 00:10:04.841
<v Speaker 1>the first 10 million you kinda made your</v>
<v Speaker 1>point and the fact that we don't know </v>

178
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:10.271
<v Speaker 1>between 15 and 60 is actually an </v>
<v Speaker 1>indication of the horror of it because </v>

179
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:16.900
<v Speaker 1>our count is off by tens of millions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's only within the last century.</v>

180
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:23.710
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the 1956 crackdown on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungary and the 1968 invasion of </v>

181
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:28.601
<v Speaker 1>Czechoslovakia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there was the whole like thermo </v>

182
00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:29.990
<v Speaker 1>nuclear Holocaust thing that was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on at the same time,</v>

183
00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:34.991
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that in 1962 and in 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were seconds away from complete </v>

184
00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:38.780
<v Speaker 1>annihilation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right during the Cuban missile crisis,</v>

185
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.610
<v Speaker 1>the keys were in the intercontinental </v>
<v Speaker 1>ballistic missile release systems.</v>

186
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And Castro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he admitted to Jimmy Carter in case </v>

187
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.870
<v Speaker 1>any of you are Castro fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you shouldn't be,</v>

188
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.250
<v Speaker 1>that he was perfectly willing to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba annihilated if it would've meant </v>

189
00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.251
<v Speaker 1>the defeat of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in 1984 approximately,</v>

190
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I may have the date exactly wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians received an indication from</v>

191
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:12.251
<v Speaker 1>their early warning systems that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans had launched five Thurman </v>

192
00:11:12.251 --> 00:11:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear Missiles and one Russian decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was a mistake and refused to </v>

193
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:21.140
<v Speaker 1>launch the retaliation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just died about two weeks ago.</v>
