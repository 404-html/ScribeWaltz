1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Chimps are brutal creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.340
<v Speaker 1>like they go to war a and so if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chimp territory out in the jungle,</v>

3
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>then the the juveniles will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the males in particular,</v>

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>the band together in groups of four or </v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

5
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>There's often but not always a female or</v>
<v Speaker 1>two with them,</v>

6
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.110
<v Speaker 1>and if they come across chimps from </v>
<v Speaker 1>another troupe that aren't within their </v>

7
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say they will,</v>

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they outnumber them because they </v>

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>can't really count,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can estimate magnitude </v>

10
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>visually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same as counting,</v>

11
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 1>but if they outnumber them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will tear them to pieces and chimps</v>

12
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>or at least twice as strong as a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well developed human male.</v>

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>And so they can tear you up pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And chimps are perfectly capable.</v>

14
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:46.881
<v Speaker 1>They hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're carnivorous like human beings </v>

15
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:46.881
<v Speaker 1>and they hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hunt,</v>

16
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:51.651
<v Speaker 1>call a monkeys often they weigh about 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds and they'll basically eat them </v>

17
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:51.651
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

18
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>A monkey screaming away like mad because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>it's in pain because it's being eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

20
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't slow the chimps down a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no cross species empathy </v>

21
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>stopping them from having their snack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

22
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:09.081
<v Speaker 1>chimps are very brutal creatures and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious they have a lot of </v>

23
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>internal inhibition of their aggression </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

24
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Most of the inhibition is sociological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out in the hierarchy.</v>

25
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:20.811
<v Speaker 1>And so the reason chimps aren't always </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive with one another is because </v>

26
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>they know who can pound them and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who will gang up on them and who </v>

27
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>won't be established their hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

28
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about a champ hierarchy and </v>

29
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a fairly strong and</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive creature.</v>

30
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>You might think it's biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugliest,</v>

31
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>meanest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most vicious,</v>

32
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>irritable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant chimp that rises to the top.</v>

33
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of the postmodernist view of</v>

34
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>human society.</v>

35
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens sometimes.</v>

36
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 1>But what happens in dwell has documented</v>
<v Speaker 1>this quite nicely,</v>

37
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>is that tyron chimps lead unstable </v>
<v Speaker 1>regimes.</v>

38
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>that might sound familiar because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing of course is true human </v>

40
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

41
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because you know,</v>

42
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>people don't like tyrants and chimps </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like them that much either.</v>

43
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>And chimps are actually quite reciprocal</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their social interactions.</v>

44
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>So they don't just dominate each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they groom each other,</v>

45
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>they have friendships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can track social relationships over</v>

46
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:18.741
<v Speaker 1>very long periods of time now and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that and so they engage in reciprocal</v>

47
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say prosocial reciprocal </v>

48
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>interactions and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the,</v>

49
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>what's the weak point of the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugliest,</v>

50
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>toughest chimp in the troop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is he doesn't have any friends.</v>

51
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:39.651
<v Speaker 1>maybe as a bad day is a little hung over</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever for eating fermented bananas</v>

53
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 1>or whatever he is partying with and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the slightly less ugly,</v>

54
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>less slightly less mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chimps decide,</v>

55
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>well this is a good time to take them </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and they tear him to pieces.</v>

56
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things to Wallace </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed out quite nicely is that if you </v>

57
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>want to have a stable chimp dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

58
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:02.661
<v Speaker 1>let's call it a regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stable ones aren't ruled by the </v>

59
00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>tyrants because tyrants get taken out </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

60
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>by paired up friendship dyads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

61
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>So that's really worth thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

62
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

63
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.890
<v Speaker 1>because it indicates that even in </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures that have less complex </v>

64
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.060
<v Speaker 1>sociological orders and they do because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that predicts how </v>

65
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:31.131
<v Speaker 1>complex your social order is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how big your brain is compared to your </v>

66
00:03:31.131 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's encephalization essentially,</v>

67
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:36.571
<v Speaker 1>and the more encephalitis to creature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larger the social groups that </v>

68
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:40.161
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course human beings are very </v>

69
00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:40.161
<v Speaker 1>highly encephalitis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have quite complicated group,</v>

70
00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:44.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have quite complicated group </v>

71
00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.211
<v Speaker 1>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even in simpler group organizations </v>

72
00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:50.571
<v Speaker 1>like the chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't the tyrant who rule stable and </v>

73
00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Speaker 1>that turns out to be also incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

74
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

75
00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.390
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much for the idea that power is the </v>

76
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.390
<v Speaker 1>only game in town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you got to ask.</v>

77
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.500
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.040
<v Speaker 1>this is actually a postmodern question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

79
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.250
<v Speaker 1>one of the things Dennis said that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>main postmodern joker is that by </v>

80
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>categorizing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

81
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.340
<v Speaker 1>you privilege one concept and you pray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you force other concepts out to the </v>

82
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.340
<v Speaker 1>margins.</v>

83
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.420
<v Speaker 1>And so he believed that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct it a hierarchy of power,</v>

84
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.020
<v Speaker 1>that the hierarchy of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege certain people and </v>

85
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.501
<v Speaker 1>marginalized others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know that's really not that </v>

86
00:04:30.501 --> 00:04:31.320
<v Speaker 1>brilliant and observation as far as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

87
00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:34.560
<v Speaker 1>it's rather commonplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All it means is that when you categorize</v>

88
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:39.561
<v Speaker 1>something that there are things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the category and a bunch of things </v>

89
00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>that aren't and so you actually can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorize anything,</v>

90
00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>which meant means you can't perceive </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

91
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>which means you can't think or live </v>
<v Speaker 1>without making some things in the middle</v>

92
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>and everything else on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

93
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.570
<v Speaker 1>It's part of categorization itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe the postmodernist would go </v>

94
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>far enough to question the utility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization itself.</v>

95
00:04:57.181 --> 00:04:59.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think to some degree they do do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

96
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.580
<v Speaker 1>But I'm the point here is that if you.</v>

97
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.390
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask why it is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

98
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>if you were a postmodernist yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it is that you would privilege the </v>

99
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.621
<v Speaker 1>idea of power above all else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So exactly what is it that you're </v>

100
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:25.460
<v Speaker 1>pushing to the margin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something that we're going</v>

101
00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:26.480
<v Speaker 1>to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

102
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.490
<v Speaker 1>here's one thing you might push to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>margin.</v>

103
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:33.491
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies are a consequence of power.</v>

104
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Well then you push competence to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>margin and then applying the postmodern </v>

105
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 1>modernist logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

106
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason you're privileging power is </v>

107
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.490
<v Speaker 1>so that you can produce so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could push competence to the margin,</v>

108
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.760
<v Speaker 1>and so you want to keep that in mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

109
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>because that's going to become important</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we discussed the relationship between</v>

110
00:05:53.031 --> 00:05:58.031
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're after the destruction of </v>

111
00:05:58.031 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>the idea competence itself.</v>

112
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.440
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

113
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.060
<v Speaker 1>froggy postmoderns and we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it a little bit.</v>

114
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>We'll return to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to talk a little bit </v>

115
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.450
<v Speaker 1>about Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a quote here from mark's.</v>

116
00:06:12.451 --> 00:06:15.420
<v Speaker 1>The proletarians have nothing to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our chains.</v>

117
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty good for like 1880 or 1890 </v>

118
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>or whenever it was he wrote at somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>around that period of time it turned out</v>

119
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 1>the proletarians had a lot more to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>than their chains.</v>

120
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>They had their lives and their families </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose.</v>

121
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>That was demonstrated and play as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the.</v>

122
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sociological movements that were put</v>

123
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:41.291
<v Speaker 1>into place when the Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions began to govern </v>

124
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 1>societies like the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

125
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.950
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take the same postmodernist </v>

126
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's some basic tenants of Marxism.</v>

127
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>It's Berge Lousy against proletariat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bridge was the year,</v>

128
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 1>the capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the property owners,</v>

129
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proletariat,</v>

130
00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>the working class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes.</v>

131
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>The basic idea is that history itself is</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but the,</v>

132
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the documentation of the struggle of one</v>

133
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>class against the other.</v>

134
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

135
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

136
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.800
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

137
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's okay because it's too simple.</v>

138
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously too simple.</v>

139
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of motivations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have.</v>

140
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them are associated with power.</v>

141
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

142
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will leave that.</v>

143
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's give the devil his due and say,</v>

144
00:07:31.821 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

145
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:37.331
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still a fair bit of tension </v>

146
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:37.331
<v Speaker 1>between the haves and the haves and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>nots.</v>

147
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that was even more intense in </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous societies than it is now.</v>

148
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:44.921
<v Speaker 1>And it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt that economics plays a </v>

149
00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:47.381
<v Speaker 1>role in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in virtually everything that human </v>

150
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:47.381
<v Speaker 1>beings do in a fairly significant role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let,</v>

151
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:49.180
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's accept that as a</v>

152
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 2>potential theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

153
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:51.890
<v Speaker 2>it's simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's</v>

154
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.040
<v Speaker 1>practically useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's kind of an offshoot of </v>

155
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.040
<v Speaker 1>that theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

156
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a Marxist,</v>

157
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 1>that means you have sympathy for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class,</v>

158
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:04.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what you're saying all </v>

159
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:04.451
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

160
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:04.451
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor working class,</v>

161
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 1>they're all oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poor,</v>

162
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>poor proletariat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

163
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're also saying,</v>

164
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 1>well we're the good guys because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing on the side of the oppressed.</v>

165
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might also ask what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're marginalizing when you claim that</v>

166
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:20.681
<v Speaker 1>you're the good guys because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you would be marginalizing </v>

167
00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 1>is all of the ways in which you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good guys,</v>

168
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:23.960
<v Speaker 1>but we can leave that aside for a moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

169
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's the claims is that,</v>

170
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the working class against the </v>

171
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:32.640
<v Speaker 1>ruling class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another claim is the ruling class is the</v>

172
00:08:32.641 --> 00:08:35.550
<v Speaker 1>ruined class because they exploited the </v>
<v Speaker 1>working class,</v>

173
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.460
<v Speaker 1>basically stealing their excess labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>from them.</v>

174
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another very,</v>

175
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a what,</v>

176
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:48.510
<v Speaker 1>a surfacely attractive claim that lacks </v>
<v Speaker 1>any reasonable justification because </v>

177
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on the idea of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a zero sum game.</v>

178
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>And clearly the world is not a zero sum </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

179
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>So when someone creates wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone is wealthy,</v>

180
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>it can be at least at times because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>created it,</v>

181
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>not because they swiped it from someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

182
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

183
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>you can think of someone like Bill Gates</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Steve Jobs is a good example of that.</v>

184
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:18.621
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're what they produced had a value </v>

186
00:09:18.621 --> 00:09:22.011
<v Speaker 1>that far exceeded what they garnered as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of their production even </v>

187
00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:22.950
<v Speaker 1>though what they garnered was fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial.</v>

188
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get,</v>

189
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give the devil his due.</v>

190
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:31.641
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the bourgeoisie against the </v>

191
00:09:31.641 --> 00:09:33.321
<v Speaker 1>proletariat will accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's class warfare is the primary </v>

192
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 1>historical mover.</v>

193
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

194
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>but here's what I'm not willing to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>away so easily.</v>

195
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have sympathy for the working class </v>

196
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 1>primarily and we're good because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

197
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna like,</v>

198
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 1>give that away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So simply.</v>

199
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.660
<v Speaker 1>So let's investigate that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can actually figure it </v>

200
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:53.660
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's true,</v>

201
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.910
<v Speaker 1>we'll say a use a pragmatic approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a pragmatist in that William</v>

202
00:09:59.340 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 1>James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sansa,</v>

203
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:06.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you can think about it even </v>

204
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.910
<v Speaker 1>more deeply in anciently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

205
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a statement in the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>

206
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's by their fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shall know the fine.</v>

207
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to walk down that road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

208
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.940
<v Speaker 1>before we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now that's another thing you have to </v>

209
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:19.940
<v Speaker 1>keep in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we do that,</v>

210
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I want to make one more detour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

211
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 1>So I like making detours and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangling all back together.</v>
