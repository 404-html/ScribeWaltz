Speaker 1:          00:00          So alright, next borders are reasonable. How about that? The law is the border that stops someone from stealing your

Speaker 1:          00:21          laptop. If it's an apple laptop, well it's the sort of laptop that has social justice warrior would carry and then the social justice warrior is going to be very irritated if you happen to purloin their laptop and then you might point out to them, you know it's a border that protects you from having that thing taken and they say, well, the borders should be open. It's okay man, no problem, and you hand over that laptop right now and everything else you own too. If you don't like borders and you can get rid of the damn walls in your house and you don't need doors on your bedroom either and we can keep an eye on you whenever we want and so much for borders. One of the things that really differs between liberals and conservatives between the left and the right is the right is in the right legs, tight borders between things.

Speaker 1:          01:03          It's part of being conscientious at every level, conceptually, sexually, familiarly, provincially, nationally. The right says, look, let's keep. Let's keep the borders between things pretty distinct and the left says, yeah, maybe not because some of those borders are in the wrong place and a little bit more free flow of information wouldn't be a bad thing, and the thing is that right, but so are the Conservatives and that's why you have to talk. It's like, well, we've got some borders. That's a good thing. Maybe some of them need to be moved around a little bit and that's what the political dialogue is for, but that doesn't mean that borders themselves are a bad idea. They're a great idea because without borders, everything Nash's into the same untenable state of undifferentiated chaos and you can't live in that. And so the people who are trying to tear down the borders conceptually, politically and practically what they want is the chaos that that would bring the either want that or they're too foolish to know that their pursuits will produce that.

Speaker 1:          01:58          So let's, let's, let's be a little bit clear that if you stand up and say, yeah, borders, they're okay, they've got their problems, but they're okay. That doesn't make you a a, a bigot beyond redemption. It just makes you someone with some sense and it's actually okay to be someone with some sense limits on immigration are also reasonable. Well, we need to figure out what those limits are and that's what the bloody political dialogue is for, but the fact that it should be limited to some degree is also reasonable. Otherwise, why not just open the borders and let everybody come in? Well, the reason you don't do that is because a complex system cannot tolerate extensive transformation over too short a period of time. Now you want immigrants to come in, especially if they're the sorts of immigrants who are likely to contribute properly to the success of your polity.

Speaker 1:          02:50          And lots of immigrants do that. I mean, I think the vast majority, for example, of entrepreneurs in the United States come from the Indian subcontinent. So great. You know, bring them over. They're highly educated, they're extraordinarily productive. They make lots of new businesses and then they pump money like back, like mad back in India. Good deal. But that doesn't mean that we have. Our arms are open to everyone immigration policy because it's complete rubbish. All that means is you're not thinking about it, so when he hears a coded to that for conservatives, here's something I've been thinking about this a lot lately. It should not be assumed that citizens have societies that have not evolved functional individual rights predicated polities will hold values in keeping with such policies, so we could say, look, there are a lot of countries in the world that are not governed well. The vast majority of them, right, and they'd be not governed well forever, and to me that means that there's something wrong with the values that are held collectively by the people who've established those polarities. Well, you shouldn't be naive and assume that merely because you move them to a new country, they're going to let their innate democratic longings, Florida. It doesn't work that way.

Speaker 1:          04:11          So if you stand up and say, look, you know, let's be a little cautious. Let's make sure that we don't transform our society so rapidly that we lose what we have. Let's be careful about that. That doesn't mean that you're a morally reprehensible demon. It just means that you're conservative and it's a reasonable position to hold, so there's no sense in apologizing to it for it. Now, that doesn't mean you get to like hide your bigotry under a mask of moral virtue. You know, the discrimination issue is quite clear as far as I'm concerned, so that's associated with bigotry. If you have two people who are applying for a job, you should pick the one that's most qualified and not pay any attention to any of the other attributes of the person that have nothing to do with the job. Okay? Right.

Speaker 1:          05:02          I think basically, I think we figured that out in about 1965 now. We're not doing it perfectly, you know, but it's not that much later than 1965 and our society particularly in Canada is pretty damn open. You can come in here and if you work hard and if you're fortunate and you don't get sick and God smiles on you, so to speak, you can be successful. There's still prejudice on reasonable prejudice and discrimination, but our society is not as the radical egalitarian. Equity promoters have it structurally racist, bigoted, and misogynistic. No, not only that, just so you know, there is a review. There was a recent review published and I mean recent 2017. Looking at that damn literature on unconscious bias and I knew the literature to begin with. There is no evidence that unconscious bias can be measured properly, not reliably. There also no evidence whatsoever that if you do measure it and you can't very that it does any better job of predicting actual say bias and prejudice.

Speaker 1:          06:04          Then just tests of attitude. So the notion that our culture is somehow structurally misogynistic and racist and the reason for that is because of the unconscious bias of the monsters who are running it is is, well maybe it's not wrong, but I can tell you one thing about it. It is not a scientifically justifiable proposition and that's what it's being passed off as. And I placed that firmly at the feet of the social psychologists with social psychology happens to be a fairly corrupt disciplined by the way, and the people who invented the Implicit Association test which measures unconscious bias because they have not come out publicly to the degree that they should have. Instead, our test, which was for experimental purposes, is being misused politically. You know your damn judges now because of federal five feet, half to undergo mandatory unconscious bias training before they can sit on the bench and so you don't think that's political reeducation is because you're not paying attention and there is zero evidence that it does what it's supposed to.

Speaker 1:          07:02          And I would also recommend to all of you if you happen to be in a workplace that introduces diversity training or unconscious bias training as a mandatory requirement. You tell them in no uncertain terms that you are not participating in a process that deems you bigoted and misogynistic. Without evidence of that being the case. And if you trot off to the training, then you've just agreed that that's who you are. And believe me, once you've agreed to that man, you'll be agreeing to a bunch of things you don't want to agree soon afterwards. So it's time just to put a stop to that. None of that. None of that unconscious bias retreading especially not the mandatory type.

Speaker 1:          07:48          People should be paid so that they are able and willing to perform socially useful and desirable duties. Okay. So the radical leftists, they react to me this way. They say, well you hold a position of privilege and power and I think first you don't know a god damn thing about being. You have no idea how I got to my position of privilege and power and it was no birthright. I can tell you that I was a small, like thick glasses, intellectual, non. What do you call that? Athletic Child, you know, it was a year younger than my peers. I suffered plenty of. What would you say? Trouble for my loud mouth and my intellect when I was growing up. You know, I had my struggles. I'm not complaining about it. The point is is that you can't attribute privileged to a class of people. You know when you can't attribute power to people who opt in to occupy a position of competence and authority, either there's some possibility that they occupied that because they worked hard and were fortunate.

Speaker 1:          08:46          Let's not forget about that and had some good social support and didn't have some horrible disease. Thank God, but you can't just make the case that the position is there as a reward. It's not there as far as a reward at all. It's there as a consequence of the person offering something valuable to those who want to pay for it and the reason you pay for them isn't to reward them. It isn't so that you give them a pat on the back and say, well, you're a good person and you know you deserve this position. It's because you're saying to them, produce. We find what you're producing a value and so we're going to give you what you need in order to be motivated to keep doing it, but it's not because we like you and it's not because we. We respect your rights. It has nothing to do with equity.

Speaker 1:          09:28          It's we're trying to get every God damn thing we can from you as fast as possible and we're going to pay you to do it and so people deserve their damn pay and the reason they deserve it isn't because it's a reward. It's because that's how you get productive people to do things that are difficult and time consuming and that perhaps they wouldn't do on their own accord to continue doing them so you can benefit from it. So the whole notion that, you know, we're awarding positions of privilege too, oppressive patriarchal types. It's like we just have to get rid of that. Enough of that. That's nonsense. It's absolute nonsense. And the other thing too is, you know, it's only been 30, 40 years, 50 years since women had reliable birth control, right? And we're able to enter the workforce on Moss. I'll tell you man, we've produced a cultural revolution in like 50 years.

Speaker 1:          10:14          Women are everywhere. It's like how bloody fast you expect something like that to go. And what makes you think that pushing it really hard, he's going to make it go any better. I mean, as far as I can tell, we manage that transition about as well as we possibly could have. We're still sorting out the details, but the fact that you know this is coming very rapidly down the pipes, the fact that half of our corporate board members are women is not indicative of the fact that we live in an unconsciously biased, misogynistic, patriarchal society. Sorry, wrong not correct and so we shouldn't be allowing and this is happening very, very rapidly. You can be sure Kathleen Wynne is going to be putting this in his policies rapidly as she possibly can. These equity demands to ensure that there is proportional representation of every gender, every sex, every race, every ethnicity, at every level of every organization. It's like, really? We're going to do that by governmental Fiat. It's like, that's not a society I want to live in. I tell you and I can. I can I quite certain that if you lived in that society for any length of time, you'd learned very rapidly that it isn't a society that you'd want to be part of either.
