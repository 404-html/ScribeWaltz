Speaker 1:          00:00          Breast is this positive study? No, it's maps of meaning positive psych. It's definitely not that. Why might you be villainous?

Speaker 1:          00:27          Well, first of all, because you can be. That's a big deal. You can be. It's actually an offshoot of empathy. This is something that took me decades to figure out. I figured it out when I was studying the book of Genesis because in the book of Genesis, people become self conscious and they immediately have the knowledge of good and evil. I just couldn't figure it out. It's like, what? What the hell is the relationship between that? And then really I tell you, I thought about that like for 30 years trying to puzzle that out and then I realized what it was. If you're self conscious, you can, you can conceptualize yourself as being you know that you are and you know what you're like and you know what hurts you and what doesn't, and as soon as you know what hurts you, you know what hurts her,

Speaker 1:          01:22          and so that's the knowledge of good and evil that comes along with being self conscious as this is something that distinguishes human beings from every other animal. You know a lion will eat you, but it doesn't really want to tear you apart slowly, just for the fun of it. Well, it eats you. It just wants to eat you and you, you know, you could call that evil it socks, that's for sure, but animals are beyond good and evil in that sense, but human beings, man, we can aim our malevolence and we're really good at it because we can imagine God, this would hurt and if it hurts me, man, it's really going to hurt you. So. And you need to know that you're like that because you are like that. And if you don't know you're like that, or if you don't think you're like that, you're even more like that than you think because the people who are most like that or people who don't think they're like that at all and you have to contend with that and that's why in many systems of thinking the world is conceptualized as a battle between good and evil and it's inappropriate conceptualization. It's a medic conceptualization and

Speaker 1:          02:26          the culture is the wise king in the tyrant and that's always the case and you're always stuck with that because as an individual with your negative side and your positive side year, negative side is the resentful side that is irritated that the limited conditions of being and the suffering that entails and it's arbitrary and unfair nature and no wonder you got that side has a case to make. It's not trivial in in the brothers Karamazov, that argument is laid out beautifully. There's a character Alioscha who's a monk, monastery novitiate, and not really a sparkling intellect, but a very good person and he has a brother Ivan and Ivan's a vicious genius and Ivan just take silly Osha apart and partly he does that by telling a story about that. Dostoevsky took this from a news story. The news story was that this mother and father had taken their young daughter and locked her in the outhouse overnight when it was like 30 below and you know, she stayed out there crying and screaming and froze to death and I even basically said to Lee Osha, you know, a world in which that could happen should not be.

Speaker 1:          03:48          That's good argument. You know when you can multiply that by millions of examples.

Speaker 1:          03:54          So the part of us that is opposed to being and resentful, it's got a point, man. The problem as far as I can tell is that if you act that out, then it makes what you're objecting to worse. Now you might be happy about that and you might think, well, people couldn't be consciously pursuing that, but yes they can. I would recommend a book called Pans, Ram if you're interested in that sort of thing. It's a book written by a man who raped 1200 men and killed dozens and burn things down to the ground every chance he got and tried to start a war between England and the US and who is aimed at nothing but mayhem and he wrote an autobiography at the request of a doctor who had befriended him and he tells you exactly what he did and why the story, heroin adversary, adversary order and tyranny, destruction and creation. That's the basic landscape and outside of that chaos. And so let's take a break.

Speaker 2:          05:09          Here's another way of looking at this idea.

Speaker 1:          05:19          The individual is the person who pays attention and explores and masters or who looks away

Speaker 2:          05:30          and the

Speaker 1:          05:32          the person is still inhabits unexplored territory and this is unexplored territory, and so wherever you go, there's you have two halves of you

Speaker 2:          05:45          that you have to contend with and

Speaker 1:          05:49          wherever you are with people, there's the society with its tyrannical and beneficial nature and this society in some sense is that match between what you're doing and what's happening. It's really important to get that right and then unexplored territory that's wherever and whenever. What you're doing stops working and so it's not exactly a geographical idea, you know, because when you think of explored territory, you think of geographic landscape like that, like the domain of an animal, you know, or like your house and you know that's, that's definitely an element of it, but you know, if you're in your house and a snake comes into your living room and you're in there, it's like, well that's an important difference between your house. One second to go in your house now and so your house can turn into unexplored, unexplored territory at the drop of a hat.

Speaker 1:          06:45          And that's because we live in space and time and so the unexplored territory is conceptual. It's a conceptual territory and it's just wherever you are, when things aren't working for you the way they're supposed to be. And so, and these are permanent parts of the human experience, which is why I think they are fundamental characters in our narratives. There's always you. There's some subject of the story and that subject is an ambivalent person with many different potentials and you're always somewhere and with other people because that's our territory, right? I mean we're social beyond comprehension and you know, even our primate ancestors, most of their territory was other primates and their brains and our brains are specialized to view the world as an aggregation of personalities. It's really important to us and so we tend to view the whole world that way. And then unexplored territory.

Speaker 1:          07:44          Well, that's where you don't know what to do and but you know, you do know what to do when you don't know what to do peculiarly enough. It's rather nonspecific. It's this generalized stress response and so what happens is you freeze, roughly speaking, if the threat is enough, then you produce a lot of cortisol and a lot of adrenaline so that you're bloody well ready to move quick and whatever direction you have to, and then maybe you pay more attention and that's what you do when you don't know what to do. And the problem with that is as you can stay in that state forever, man, that's kind of what posttraumatic stress disorder is. It's like you're just like that all the time. And the problem with that is it's a very uncomfortable. I mean, you stay like that for any length of time. You're going to get depressed, you're going to develop an anxiety disorder, you're going to get old because you're burning up resources like mad.

Speaker 1:          08:38          You know, your system is shunting everything to maintain that state of emergency preparation. And it's exhausting. It's not where you want to be. So that's partly why people are so prone to defend their territories. They're familiar territory because if they're familiar territory is invaded or disrupted, then they default back to the state of emergency preparation. And that's like, that can unglue you if it's. If it's profound enough. You know, and you guys know this already. I mean, I think people experience this most, particularly when they're betrayed by someone they have an intimate relationship with. You know, when they're lied to. There's other ways. The collapse of a dream or a vision that you've been pursuing or an illness or the death in the family. There's lots of other ways but be is a really good one because if you're with someone for a long time, you trust them.

Speaker 1:          09:33          You have a representation of your past, you have a representation of you in the relationship, you have a representation of them. You have a representation of of relationships. You have a representation of the future. You get betrayed. It's like poof. Even the past isn't what you thought it was. You know, and what about you? You know, how clueless are you and maybe not at all or maybe ultimately gullible. You don't know. Is it your fault or you know, or you so clueless that you just can't protect yourself or was the person malevolent in some subtle way that you failed to detect everything's up in the air, not good and this idea that human beings traveled to the underworld and come back. It's like it's a really useful thing to understand because we do that all the time. Whenever we fail, it's like whip down into the underworld for awhile where everything's in chaos and then maybe we sort ourselves out. Bang, we're back up and so one way of conceptualizing yourself is not as order and as not as chaos, but as the thing that traverses between the two domains and that I would say is the mythological hero.
