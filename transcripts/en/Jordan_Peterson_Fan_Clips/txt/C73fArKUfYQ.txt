Speaker 1:          00:00          There's the People's Republic of China that's a different country, like seriously, a different country, right? Different tradition, different language.

Speaker 1:          00:10          How many people died in China under Mao? No one knows. Same issue with the Soviet Union. Although Myra was a bigger monster than Stalin and that's, that's impressive. You know, because there's Hitler, there's Stalin and Mao and of the three mile was probably the worst. He's still revered in China. Maybe that accounts for their affinity for North Korea, which could still destroy us. All the remnants of that horrible state. Maybe 100 million people died in China during the great leap forward. That's a hell of a leap forward. Well, maybe it wasn't 100 million, you know, maybe it was only $40 million, but as I said before, when you're counting in the tens of millions, your points already made. And then there was Cambodia and the killing fields and Bulgaria in east Germany and Romania and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. That's North Korea and Vietnam and Ethiopia, Hungary, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. There was never a successful communist state cube I suppose came closest, but it was radically,

Speaker 2:          01:19          um,

Speaker 1:          01:22          the Soviets poured money into Cuba. So that doesn't really count. So then the first question was, well, are these Marxists motivated by love or hatred?

Speaker 2:          01:36          Well,

Speaker 1:          01:39          is it love or hatred that produces 100 million dead people? Is that enough evidence or not? And if it's not enough evidence, if you think to yourself, well, that's not enough evidence, it was never really given its proper, a proper try. It's like, well, why would it been a proper try? See, I always think when I hear someone say that I know what you think, you think in your delusional arrogance, that you understand the Marxist doctrines better than anyone else ever has, and that if you were the one implementing those doctrines, you would have ushered in the utopia. That's what you mean when you say that and no, they're there. They saying there's an idea in the new testament that there's a sin. It's a sin against the holy ghost. If you commit that sand, no one really knows what it is that you can't be forgiven, and I would say, well, if you want a candidate for the sin against the Holy Ghost and the 21st century, uh, the statement communism, real communism was never tried with the underlying idea that if you had been the person implementing it, it would have worked. I think that's pretty good contender for something for which you should never be forgiven. All right, so that's Marxism. So let's go onto postmodernism. We talked a little bit about it.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Now, hypothetically, it's an attitude of skepticism, irony towards rejection of grand narratives, ideologies and universalism. Crit criticizes objective notions of reason, human nature, social progress, absolute truth in objective reality. It's predicated on the idea that the reason that you categorize especially that the reason that you categorize is to marginalize you, categorize, to marginalize, to obtain power powers. Pretty much all there is. There's other elements of postmodernism. One of them is that human nature is merely a social construct. See the reason for that, as far as I'm concerned, and this is a postmodern critique as well, I'm going to move the center to the margin and the margin to the centers. Why would you think that human nature is only a social construct? Well, here's why. It's because that means you could construct it any way you want to thought it was a very common idea among this, among the communists.

Speaker 1:          04:22          You know, they. That's why Michael wanted to wipe out Chinese history. That's why the red guard wind around in China and trying to destroy everything, every element of China's history prior to approximately 1960 at that great culture. Thousands and thousands of years old as well. So you could bring in the new man. But what does the new man. Well it was whatever slave now happened to fantasize about or it was the utopian person. You take your pick, but like I said, if you take a look at the corpses, you can pretty much figure out which of those two it was. So what's up with these people? These deconstructionists sees postmodernists. What are they up to? Exactly, but here's the first thing

Speaker 1:          05:11          they came about pretty much when Marxism was no longer credible, no longer tenable as an intellectual set of intellectual propositions. Now, if you were a French intellectual, you had to have a lot of corpses piled at your feet before you were willing to think that you were wrong. So here's an example. I don't remember his name. He was the architect of the killing fields in Cambodia. It wasn't Pol Pot, it was one of his advisors. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name. He took his phd at the Sorbonne and he developed the thesis in the Sorbonne What Marxists thesis that the cities were parasites on, on the land. You know, it's an extension of the whole bourgeoisie proletarian thing. The cities were full of bourgeois types, educated and educated parasites essentially who were doing nothing but stealing what was rightly the farmers. So when he came back to Cambodia, he put that into action and emptied out the cities and put all the intellectuals and the city dwellers either to death or to work, which generally resulted in death and killed about one six to one quarter of the population, but he got his phd from the Sorbonne.

Speaker 1:          06:31          That's a good story because that's exactly how complicit the western leftist intellectuals were in facilitating the horrors of the 20th century and it's not like we've learned anything since then. Quite the contrary, but just gone underground and that's what I see. That's what I see when I see postmodernism. So what happened was,

Speaker 2:          06:55          okay,

Speaker 1:          06:56          despite the affinity of Western intellectuals for Marxism, maybe because they weren't paid as much as bankers, let's say if we're being cynical about it, because the thought that if you paid sociologists as much as investment bankers, they'd be capitalist very rapidly was. Which is also to say that you may underpay intellectuals at your peril and you know that's actually dangerous because one of the things that's happening is that as the universities have become corporatized and corrupted in a variety of ways, more and more of the professors or adjuncts, right? I think it's up to 30, 40, 50 percent, something like that. Now they've got no tenure, they've got no job security and their paid like $24,000 a year. It's not a good idea to radicalize the people that are teaching your children, but anyways, by the end of the sixties, so much data on the catastrophic failures of communism had accrued that even the most intransigent a French intellectuals had to admit that the Jig was up.

Speaker 1:          08:10          But that's a problem because that's the whole ideology, right? That's the whole raise on debt. You, he says in this terrible Alberta French, you're going to just give that up. What are you going to do after that? Well, what happened was postmodernism was invented and so it's a slight of hand as far as I can tell. So and, and with postmodernism identity politics. And so the postmodern transformation is, well, we were a little wrong with the working class thing. Turns out that Communists killed them all and capitalists make them all rich and that's actually exactly the opposite of we predicted. But maybe there's still a way this could be salvaged. How about if we, we don't say working class capitalists, we say oppressor or oppressed, we'll just. Well just trends transformed the terminology a bit and we'll start thinking about all the other ways that people are oppressed and then and all the other ways that people are oppressors. And then we can play the same damn game under a new guys.

Speaker 1:          09:26          And now look, the postmodernists were Marxists. So let's make no mistake about that. Derrida himself said that postmodernism was a transformation of Marxism. I'm not making this up. The question is why? Well, because you could say what? Postmodernism is a valid philosophical school and we'll get into that for a minute and they make some valid claims. One of them, for example, this is a central postmodernist claim, is that there's an infinite number of ways of interpreting the world and that actually turns out to be technically correct. Part of the reason that we've had a very difficult time building robots, ai robots that can operate in the real world, is because perceiving the real world turns out to be so difficult that we really can't figure out how human beings do it because it is susceptible to an infinite number of interpretations. So that's actually correct. Now I'm not going to give the postmodernists a tremendous amount of credit for discovering that because it was discovered simultaneously in about five disciplines at pretty much the same time, but you give the devil his due.
