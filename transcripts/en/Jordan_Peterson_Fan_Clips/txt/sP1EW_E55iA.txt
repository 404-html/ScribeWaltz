Speaker 1:          00:01          All then we have jimminy cricket, that's south southern US slang for Jesus Christ by the way. And the initial overlap isn't a fluke. I mean, I'm sure the animators thought that was funny and of course it is funny and you know, in, in the lion king, you know that that at bat boone, who is the shaman basically? Well, to begin with, he was kind of just a comic relief character, like a fool, you know. But one of the things young mentioned about the fool, the fool tends to turn into the savior. It's an, it's an archetypal reality. Bugs bunny is sort of like that, you know, he's a trickster. And as the, as the movie developed, the character of the fool, baboons took on the full fledged, you know, Shaman, priest element and, and you know, okay, well Jimminy cricket, he's this little cricket and, and he turns out to be the conscience, which is pretty damn weird.

Speaker 1:          00:51          It's like a bug is your conscience and a bug is jc and it's like that's a very strange juxtaposition of ideas, conscience, insect, savior. It's like, what, what's up with that? And so. Well, what bugs you, that's part of it, while your conscious conscience certainly bugs you and you should pay attention to. It's just little niggling annoying thing that you can't quite. You can override it, right? Obviously, but it's this swallowed. And he says, when he talks to Pinocchio later, he says it's that still small voice, you know, and I've asked people before, like in my personality class, like [inaudible] conscience is a weird thing. And, and like if I said to you, if you're about to do something that you know you shouldn't do, do you have a voice in your head that tells you that you shouldn't do it? So how many people have had that experience?

Speaker 1:          01:46          Okay, okay, good. Now, so other people have a feeling instead of a voice. And so is there anybody here who's willing to admit it? Who has neither the feeling nor the voice? Okay. So, and you know, it's a very understudied phenomena in psychology. This conscience. I mean people can be conscientious and maybe those are people who listen to their conscience more. I don't know, but nobody's ever investigated it. And the fact that you do have this little voice, whatever it is inside your head, it's like, what the hell is up with that? You know? And it doesn't tell you what you want to hear, at least as far as I can tell. Now you could say, well, that's the internal representation of society operating within you. That'd be a Freudian view. That's the Super Ego. And certainly there's something to that, but I don't think it's necessary to presume that that's all there is to it.

Speaker 1:          02:34          And even if it is, you still wouldn't have the voice. It's if you didn't have the biological potential to have that voice embedded itself in you. So even if it is socio culturally constructed, which it is in part, it's like language. It's like your language associate culturally constructed, but the reason you can speak is because human beings can speak and if you have a conscience, that's because human beings have a conscience and the contents of that might differ. But the fact that it exists, what seems to be to be universal, okay, so well that's the conscience and that's Jimminy cricket. And then click the cricket opens this book, and then you look at the book and you think, well what kind of book is that? Well, it's got a spotlight on it. So it's being highlighted. This is an important book. And what kind of book is it?

Speaker 1:          03:22          Well, it's leather bound. It has a lock on it, you know, it's not some cheap book. It's kind of like a, you might think about, it looks like something from an old library or maybe it looks biblical, whatever. It's a major league book. And this bug is the introduction to the book. So it does that mean your conscience is the introduction to the book? Well maybe that is what it means. It's certainly what's being played out in the movie while then the cricket opens the book. And so then what do you see? Well, what does that look like? What does it look like? What does it remind you of?

Speaker 1:          03:57          Okay, so that's the van Gogh painting. It's a nativity scene. It's the, it's the Christmas star and you know that because what's going to happen? Well, the hero is going to be born. That's what happens. And so a star signifies that, why does this star signify the birth of an infant, let's say? Well, because there's something miraculous about the birth of an infant and, and why would the infant be a savior, which is the Christian notion say, well, because that's what the infant is potentially every infant. And so that's how you should act about them. And you know, one of the things that really is interesting about having little kids, and I loved having little kids, is that you have this opportunity to have this pristine relationship with someone like, like a relationship you've never had with anyone because the kid really is just there to love you.

Speaker 1:          04:48          You like, if you don't screw it up, you've got that. And then you can keep that going. You know? And you can try to keep that relationship like pristine. And that's so fun. It's so fun to try to do that. It's, it's really, it's amazing. It's an amazing thing and you know, kids get a bad rap in our society, but it's an amazing thing to helped little kids and they are remarkable and they give you back far more than they require from you and partly because they treat you like you're, you're valuable beyond belief. That's what the kid thinks about you. It's like, that's pretty good. So yeah, it's something divine is going to happen and so okay, fine, you know, fair enough. Well, there's The star signifying that and, and that's associated in some way with this star that you're supposed to wish upon. Well, that's kind of odd. Like there's this, there's this relationship that's implicit, that star that signifies the birth of the hero is the same star that you wish upon.

Speaker 2:          05:51          Well

Speaker 1:          05:53          perhaps the star that you're wishing upon is the wish that the hero will be born in your soul. It's something like that. You're aiming at the ideal, right? It's the ideal you, whatever that would be. Well, you can certainly figure out what it isn't. That's where you start as far as I can tell, you know, you know, what you shouldn't be doing and you could at least stop doing those things and then see what happens, you know, and if you ask yourself, it's a meditative exercise, you know, and you do this with the autobiography to some degree. It's like, okay, sit down for 10 minutes and have a little dialogue with yourself. Like you actually wanted to know the answer, you know? So yeah, ask, well I'm probably doing something stupid that if I quit doing my life would be better, that I could quit doing that I would quit doing.

Speaker 1:          06:38          And maybe it's not a very big thing because you're not very disciplined, but maybe there's something to ask yourself that question, man, you'll have an answer and no time flat like, well, I should start doing this. It's like, yeah, I know I could. I didn't, you know, I won't, but. Or maybe I would, but if I did, I know my life would be better. It's like you can figure that out immediately and if you do that 100 times, well you'll be in way better shape. So if you don't know what to do, that's good. You could at least figure out what you shouldn't do that's just moronically you know, pathetic. And you can be sure you're doing like a dozen of those things. At least you know, procrastinating or you know, you know everyone. That's what the conscience tells you and if you ask, they'll just tell you why you're stupid and insufficient. And so who wants to hear that? But what, maybe you could do something about it.

Speaker 1:          07:32          Okay. So the cricut comes into the village there and he sees this, this like little house and there's a little fire in it. And so it's Kinda got a welcoming place. It's a light in the darkness. This house just like the star. And so he hops towards it and then he ends up inside it and you know, there's a nice fire and you get to see the inside and the insights. It's cozy, you know, it's welcoming. And then when you look around, you see that everything's kind of in its place. It's not hyper organized or anything like that. It's friendly and welcoming and it's, there's a lot of wood and there's a nice fire and then there's toys everywhere and they're well constructed. So you know that whoever lives there likes children. And so if someone likes children, well, if someone doesn't like children, it's like you should run away from them very rapidly.

Speaker 1:          08:12          But if they liked children, well then that's a good sign that you know Jesus there, at least human. It's a start, you know? And then these things are all high quality. They're made very well. And then there's, and he's looking around to see all of this and there's, there's toys and there's clocks and they're all handmade. And so he sort of infers that maybe there's a woodcarver, who, who lives there and a woodcarver. Someone who, who can build things. And if you build things that work and that are beautiful, that's, that's a kind of truth, right? It's like it's built right into the object. That's what quality is. Quality is the, the, the building into an object of truth. The thing works. It does what it's supposed to. It has integrity and so you see that everywhere inherent, so you're getting a sense of the, the, the, the film makers are setting the stage and so while, so they set the stage by showing you the stage and the cricket tells you what he sees and he's pretty happy to be there because.

Speaker 1:          09:07          And this is also someone who's concerned about time, right? Because there was a lot of clocks, there's a lot of clocks and so time turns out to be an important sub element of this story and then he sees the puppet marionette and so what's a marion out? Well, a Marionette, and then he'd be sitting on the shelf. A marionette is something that's quite animated because it can move. It doesn't really have a soul, but it sort of acts like it has a soul. It in, in, in, in the sense of anima and soul. It animated and. But a Marionette is something that is being manipulated by something else behind the scenes, right? It doesn't have its own volition. It's dependent on the will have something behind the scenes and so there's a strong implication that whatever this thing is is half formed and that it's being manipulated by unseen forces behind unseen forces behind the facade.

Speaker 1:          10:03          Well, that's a freudian idea. That's you. That's all of you. You know, you're polled hither and fro by unconscious forces and some of those are biological and some of them are cultural, you know, and you think about people who are swept up in great ideological movements like the Communists or the fascist is like those people are marrying nets. That's exactly what they are. They all say the same thing. They almost the same words. They all act the same way and some things behind it. And the question is what? Well, that is the question and that's partly what this movie tries to figure out. So you see this Marionette, he's at half formed, wouldn't headed puppet and he has a little bit of potential, you know, and the cricket goes up and interacts with them and sees that he's made out of pretty good wood. It makes a little joke about having a wooden head and you know, that's kind of obvious what that means.

Speaker 1:          10:53          And you noticed the cricket is dressed like a tramp and, and when you first saw him he wasn't, he was dressed like a 19 twenties millionaire. So, but no, but here he's a tramp and this is so interesting. It's like, so this bug, that's a messiah, that's the introduction to the book. That's the conscience is also a tramp with no home. It's like what does that mean? And it took me a long time to sort that out and it's like he's been everywhere. This tramp, he's been everywhere and, and he knows he's, he's traveled the world and anybody who doesn't have a place, he doesn't have a home. He hasn't made a relationship with anything real yet. He's, he's kind of a potential. And this is one of the things that's really interesting about this movie because if you think about the cricket as a fragment of the of the hero and say a, a reflection of the of the savior, which is his relationship with jc of course, and the person who introduces the book, then the story gets strange because if it was merely a representation of the perfect person, the archetype of the hero, then the conscience would know everything, right?

Speaker 1:          12:02          And it would just tell the puppet what to do and that would be the end of it. But that, first of all, that's adult story. It's like perfect conscience comes along. Puppet does everything. It says being goal perfection, but that isn't what happens. There's this weird idea that this thing that's got all these attributes needs a home and has to enter into a learning relationship with the thing that it's trying to transform. It's so sophisticated because you know, I could say you should do what your conscience tells you. It's like, well, maybe not. Maybe that's not exactly how it works. Maybe your conscience isn't omniscient and omnipotent. Maybe it's not gone right. It's a guide, but it's, it's, it's, it's maybe smarter than you sometimes maybe because it's society in your head and obviously it's smarter than you sometimes because it tells you not to do something and you go do it and then you get into trouble and you think, well, if I would've just listened, but you don't, and that's interesting too.

Speaker 1:          12:59          It's something that you don't have to listen to, which is seems to be associated with freewill. It's weird. It's like if your conscience knows what to do, why aren't you just a deterministic puppet of your conscience Christ? That would work a lot better. You wouldn't have to torture yourself and you wouldn't make any mistakes. So why the separation? Well, maybe it's because of the conscience is generic and so it has to be taught. It has to learn to, and so what you do is you have a dialogue with your conscience. It's something like that and then you expose yourself to more and more of the world and you get wiser in your conscience gets wiser and new. You mature together and that's what happens in this story because the cricket starts out as a tramp that you know, is smarter than the puppet but not as smart as he thinks he is.

Speaker 1:          13:46          That's for sure. And when he first starts to operate as a conscience, he's completely useless. Added. He babbles off a lot of cliches about morality and then he's late the first day for his job and he's just not very good at it. And so there's this weird idea that the conscience, which is part of what puts you towards redemption is something that you actually have to interact with over the course of your life in order for it to develop as you develop. And so then I would also say that the cricket represents, at least in part what you described as the self, which is like the potential fully developed human being that sort of exists within you as a possibility, but it has to be. It has to be manifest in the actual conditions of your life. And so the conscience has to learn how to position itself here and now and it's got generic advice and that's not good enough. And so that's why the cricket is looking for a home. And so he needs a home even though he's all these other things we already said he was, he has to find a specific home before he can become who he could be. Well, so then Japan, oh, shows up and he's a kindly old guy, which is pretty much exactly what you'd expect. And you know, he, he's a careful craftsman and he likes kittens and you know, that's always a good thing.

Speaker 1:          15:00          And he has some fish and I know he's. And He's good at making things and he's got a sense of humor and he's kind of playful. And so he's, he's a, he's a good father. Fundamentally. He's the wise king. He's the positive archetype of the masculine. That's what he is. And so he's culture and its positive manifestation. And he gives rise to this creation, which is his puppet, which is what culture does because you're a puppet of your culture, you're a Marionette of your culture. And so maybe you could be more than that, and that's the other thing that's strange about this movie, and it's strange about the mythological way of looking at the world because scientifically deterministically, there's nature and there's culture and you are the deterministic product of the interaction between nature and culture. There's nothing else to you than that. That's that. But the mythological world doesn't say that. It says something different. It says that there's nature and culture, and then there's you and the you that's in there has choices and the destiny and that you actually affect the interplay of nature and culture in determining your own character. And it insists upon that. The oldest stories we have, there's always the hero and the archetypal mother and the archetype. Father. There's always those three things. There's never just two. So from a narrative perspective, there's always the implication that there is something autonomous about the, the hero of the story.
