Speaker 1:          00:02          You can hear me ? Here we go. Thank you, Mr Hillier, that's for the introduction and also for the invitation. So not everyone will invite me places. So it's nice when an invitation shows up, yeah and when I'm actually allowed to speak, that's also good. So I have a habit of not preparing my talks until really the last minute. And I mean that's not exactly true because I've been thinking about what I'm going to talk to you about tonight for a very long time, but I really only got the title for this talk firmly in place about half an hour ago. And, and one of the things I like to do when I'm speaking to people is to tell them what I'm thinking about, not what I've already thought about, you know, and certainly not what I know, but what I'm thinking about, what I'm trying to figure out.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And so one of the things that's happened to me over the last year, somewhat surprisingly, is that I've been invited to speak in front of a lot of conservative groups and uh, a lot of them were conservative groups that were composed of young people. And that was interesting, you know, because conservatism isn't something that's necessarily all that easy to sell to young people because they tend not to be that conservative to begin with. And conservatism also tends to have quite a lot to do with things that you shouldn't do and instead of things that you might be allowed to do. And so there's a restrictive element of it that's also perhaps less attractive to young people than it might be. People do tend to get more conservative as they get older, as their personality shift. And so, but what I saw was very interesting because I saw this was particularly true of young men and I haven't quite puzzled that out yet, but, you know, I would talk about what was going on in the universities and what I thought might constitute a reasonable antidote to that.

Speaker 1:          01:57          And that was, uh, not only in the universities but also politically, but, and that was both the adoption of responsibility instead of the incredible and constant stress that's being placed on rights and also the responsibility of the citizen to speak forward what he or she believed to be true or at least to not speak what they knew to be false, which is at least a good place to start. And one of the things I found so remarkable was that this was actually a salable message to young people. And that surprised me because you know, you wouldn't necessarily think that you would turn a lot of lights on in a young audience by talking to people about truth and responsibility. I think if you, if you went to a marketing agency and told them that that was going to be your political message to young people, they would tell you to go back and, you know, flesh out another plan, sketch out another plan. But maybe young people have been talked to enough about rights for maybe about the next 15 decades. That's what I would think. And so maybe there's a hunger a among young people for something that has a little bit more respectability, let's say, a little bit more depth than the constant emphasis on, on

Speaker 1:          03:10          doing whatever you want, whenever you want. Let's let's put it that way. The thing about that, and the thing about rights in general, the idea of rights is that rights don't really give you much direction, right? They, they, they tell you what you are in principal allowed to do, but they don't really tell you what you should do. And it actually turns out that you need to know what you should do because you need to do something right. People are active and our lives don't have any meeting without something to do and, and something that you should do. It can't just be something that you want to do that's too shallow. There's no deep meaning. There's no enduring, there's no sustaining meaning in that. It's just impulsiveness and, and the. And maybe that's okay. In some sense, maybe that's entertaining and maybe it's and maybe it's impulsively exciting and fun and there's some, there's some utility in that for life.

Speaker 1:          03:53          But life is a very difficult journey, let's say it involves a lot of suffering and it involves a lot of, of heavy existential weight and you need to be able to put something, a value up against that so that you can withstand your life and you can stand up with some dignity and you can contribute to your community and you can feel that you're a worthwhile person, you know, in spite of all the things that are, that you're doing wrong and in spite of all the problems that you have. And so then people need to know what they should do and one of the things they should do is take responsibility. And another thing they should do is try to tell the truth because those two things help them live proper lives and then help society organizes itself properly. And that's, that's good, that's good for everyone. So, and so it turns out that when you tell young people that they're pretty damn happy about that. And so one of the things I thought I would do tonight is talk about what conservatives might have to offer to young people as a saleable message. You know, because my, the other thing I've learned over the last year, and this was quite

Speaker 1:          04:58          revealing, let's put it that way. I'll start with a brief story just as a little intro to this. In the last three weeks, some of you may know that there was quite a political storm that emerged particularly among journalists over the issue of cultural appropriation. A number of journalists got in real trouble for transgressing the politically correct norms in relationship to cultural appropriation, a tremendously ill defined, and let's call it pathological concept. We could start with that, but. But the thing that was so interesting and I think I probably talked to 10 of Canada's top 20 journalists. That would be a reasonable estimate. Most of them in print, but not all of them. Every single one of them told me that they were censoring themselves. Or you think about that man, that's no joke. In a country like this and these people, you think, well, if anyone has power, they have power.

Speaker 1:          05:49          It's like, well, they don't really have power. They have competence and influence and that's not the same thing as power and they're bloody afraid of being hung out to dry if they say the wrong thing. You think about where our damn country is. When the 10 most powerful journalists in the country are afraid to write and say what they think, that's not a good thing, man. That's not a good thing. I don't care what it is that they want to say or think the fact that they're not only did they tell me that they were censoring themselves and that they felt that they would be hung out to dry if they said the wrong thing, but they also told me that they were being censored by their editors and so you know, in a country that has a great tradition and a tradition that's much longer than this country has been around of freedom and free speech and free press.

Speaker 1:          06:33          For us to be in this situation now where our major journalists are afraid that if they misstep inappropriately in this new found political landmine that they're going to be done. That is not good. Right? That's a bad diagnostic sign. Okay. Well, I said that story was a little intro to the other story was going to tell you and then so I've been fortunate enough over the last several months to meet not the majority of the people who ran for the leadership of the Federal Conservative Party, but most of them, including the people, the person who Andrew, who recently won and uh, they all told me the same thing, which was also interesting was that the conservatives were afraid to be conservative and if for exactly the same reason, they were afraid that if they put forward valid conservative perspectives that they would be isolated and mobbed and taken down and, and that made them censor themselves and not be willing to speak up. And I thought, and I told each of them when we discussed this, the same thing was if you guys are afraid to talk, you've already lost. You might as well just pack up and go home. It's done now, you know, as a psychologist.

Speaker 2:          07:47          Thank you. Fuck,

Speaker 1:          07:51          I got to say, I'm not making a case for conservatism. I'm not here to make a political case. Right? I'm here to make a philosophical and psychological case and I think that's what I've been doing all along. It has political implications, so I'm not saying that you should be conservative or that conservative is the only way to be because I actually don't believe that for for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons is that I know that political belief is determined in large part by temperament and personality and that's very strongly biologically influenced and so conservatives tend to be lower and openness, which is a trait associated with creativity and hiring conscientiousness, which is a trait associated with industriousness and orderliness. They tend to make good managers and administrators and lawyers. They tend to make good conservative business types. That's, that's their forte, that's their niche and that's a valid place to be in a valid thing to be and you know, conservatives aren't so good at being entrepreneurial and they're not so good at being artistic and creative.

Speaker 1:          08:45          That's not their niche. That's more the niche of the liberal end of the spectrum and as far as I'm concerned, for the political system to function properly, you need proper representation for all the temperamental types and they need to be engaged in dialogue. So. But the thing is is that when the conservatives are saying, well, you know, especially when they're perhaps thinking about leading the damn party, let's say that they're worried about speaking their mind in a conservative manner. That's just not a good thing. That means that something's gone wrong with our political system and seriously wrong. You know, when. The other thing that. Another thing that I've noticed it thing, you know, when, when this all. Some of you may know in some of you may not know that I made a couple of videos back September 27th. I woke up one night because I couldn't sleep and I thought, are you usually going right if I can't sleep because I've got something to figure out.

Speaker 1:          09:35          But I've been playing with youtube videos. I've been putting my lectures online since 2013 and by last April they had about a million views. And so I thought, wow, that's, that's really something, man, you know, like you write a book and you sell a million copies, you're one happy character. And I thought a million views is a very large number of views. It really tuned me into the fact that youtube was something completely other than what I thought it was. But anyways, that night I thought, oh, I'll get up, I'll make a video instead of writing it down. And this was a video about bill [inaudible], which by the way, the Senate just passed, right? Half the conservatives voted for it, despite the fact that the justice minister was presented with an amendment that clearly indicated that bill see 16 would not infringe upon free speech and refused to consider the amendment.

Speaker 1:          10:22          So that's where we are. There's compelled speech is now. The law in Canada isn't yet, but it's going to be very soon and half the conservatives voted for that damn bill. And I can tell you to, you know, people have gotten after me for being, you know, anti transgender and bigoted and phobic and all that nonsense that the left tends to hurl at people. It's not the case. I read that damn legislation and I read the policies surrounding it and I knew perfectly well that the way it's formulated right now, it will do more harm to the people that purports to protect then good. That'll take about 10 years to unfold, but it's so incoherent and the the the principles upon which that legislation and it's surrounding policies are based, are so paradoxical and contradictory that they will act themselves out because that's what happens with paradoxical beliefs and tangled people up like the men that tight tangle people up in them like mad and we'll see that happen over the next decade and it's partly because the people who put bill 60 [inaudible] forward, especially with regards to its surrounding policies.

Speaker 1:          11:24          The ones that are detailed out on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website don't give a damn about transgendered people. As far as I'm concerned there. There's another agenda at work that's driving their entire political force forward and the transgender types. We're just flavor of the month, right? They were poster boys for moving this postmodern agenda forward and so the fact that the legislation isn't going to do them any good during the transgendered people any good isn't going to stop the people who put the legislation forward. So anyways, I made these videos and I put them on a, on youtube and well to say that they caused a storm, which is somewhat of an understatement. I mean it's just been. I just, I, I don't even know what to think about. It's completely and absolutely surreal what, what's happened to me like as a consequence of that, I mean I don't know how many people have watched those original videos, like $350,000. I think now about 50 million people have watched videos associated with this sequence of events that I'm describing, which is just 350,000 people watched the testimony that I gave before the Senate on bill [inaudible]. You bloody well know that the apocalypse is close when 350,000 people around the world watch a Canadian Senate hearing. So I really, I mean really what's going on man?

Speaker 1:          12:49          So anyways, you know, so, you know, I said, well the journalists are nervous and the, and the, and the, the part where they're conservatives are nervous and, and uh, well then, you know, when I, when I put myself out and made these videos, which are really didn't expect to attract much attention at all, I just assumed that I was going to clarify what I was thinking a little bit and you know, to see what happened. I kind of a curious person now that'll teach me but I'm kind of a curious person. And so, um, but then, you know, I also experienced firsthand what happens when you do something like that. Now I got nailed right. I got especially for about three months, things were pretty up in the air at the university sent me two letters telling me that it was so funny because I've made this video and I said, you know, under this new legislation, making this video, criticizing this legislation is probably illegal.

Speaker 1:          13:37          And so then the unit and people of course reacted to me as if I was scaremongering, which by the way was the right response. When you hear someone in a stable society stand up and say, excuse me, there's a, there's something rotten at the base here, and it's affecting the manner in which the legislation that our country is producing is, is, is being rolled fourth, when they say that you should think that person is probably a charlatan and has something wrong with them because look, the culture works pretty good. The has worked really well for a long period of time, and so the logical initial response should be, yeah, you think there's a fundamental problem, why shouldn't we just assume that there's a fundamental problem with you? And one of the ways that you determined that is you throw things out the person metaphorically and see if any of them stick, right? So, you know, I was a big homophobic and transphobic and a racist. That one, I don't know where the hell that one came from. I think it was because I, I, I criticize the two. Uh, what would you call reprehensible women who started black lives, black lives matter movement, Toronto. It isn't because they're black. It's because they're reprehensible, black or white. Man. If you're reprehensible, your reprehensible, that's sort of the definition of not being racist. Right. So

Speaker 1:          14:53          anyways, so, so, so there were a couple of demonstrations and then the press jumped on me to some degree. They didn't do too bad a job I didn't think and then the university thankfully wrote two letters saying that what I was doing was probably illegal and that it violated the, the Ontario Human Rights Commission's policies and probably the university's policies as well as far as they were concerned, which really wasn't the case and the letters also contained a number of untruths which I detailed because I read them on Youtube too, which is actually quite helpful and handy that you know, if someone writes me a letter that purports to lay out a set of facts, then I can just read it. I don't even have to comment on it. I can read it and let people make up their own minds, which they did so, so well. And so my job was in, in, in, in doubt.

Speaker 1:          15:41          But the fact that the university went after me actually turned out to be extremely helpful. Right. Because I had said, look under the provisions of this new legislation and legislation like this that's already in place in Canada, what I am doing criticizing this bill is probably illegal. And everyone said, no, you're crazy. You know you're, there's something wrong with you. You're a, you're a, you're a scaremonger. And a rabble rouser and all of that. And then the university wrote a letter saying what you did violated the, you know, the university policy and probably the Ontario Human Rights Commission's policies and the law. And I thought, great, you had your lawyers take a look at it. I couldn't have asked for a more stronger statement, a stronger statement in support of what I had said, especially because it certainly wasn't written in support of what I had set. So, and then the journalist started to pay attention to what I had actually looked at and they read it and they thought, Oh hey, look at that. That don't that ordinary human rights commission website policy mass is actually quite a nest of spiders. Just like he said.
