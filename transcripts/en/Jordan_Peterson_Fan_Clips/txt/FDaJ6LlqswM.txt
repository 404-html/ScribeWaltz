Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, what time is it? I started when 6:30. I shouldn't stop them. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:32          I'm going to go for five more minutes and then I'll wrap this up. I want to talk about intersectionality and, and white privilege a bit.

Speaker 1:          00:45          So.

Speaker 2:          00:48          So I first said, well, we analyzed Marxism, we analyzed postmodernism. I suggested that postmodernism was a way for the Marxist to keep going under a new guys. I suggested that Marxism was fundamentally based on hatred rather than sympathy and empathy. I suggested that the corpses were the, the evidence for that. Um, I told you why I think postmodernism is fundamentally wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Um,

Speaker 2:          01:17          now I want to talk to you a little bit about white privilege.

Speaker 2:          01:22          So the first thing that I, and I haven't got this quite figured out yet, I can't quite figure out why the postmodernists have made the canonical distinctions. They've made race, ethnicity, sexual proclivity, sexual, gender identity. Let's say those are four dimensions along which people vary, but there's a very large number of dimensions along which people vary, right? In fact, given that there's an infinite number of ways of interpreting the world, you can immediately point out that there's an infinite number of dimensions along which people vary, and so then the postmodern question is, why would you privilege some of those dimensions over the other? And I would say, well, because it sustains your bloody Marxist interpretation. That's why, but you're not going to say that because it marginalizes, right? You've marginalized that so you can ignore it. So that's one of the fun things about postmodernism. You can. You can. I have a very vulgar image in my mind, but I won't share that with you, but you can infer it. Here's some ways people differ. Intelligence, temperament, geography, historical time. You live now in not 100 years ago. Attractiveness. That's a big. That's a big one. That's a big one. Would you imagine? You could.

Speaker 1:          02:41          We won't.

Speaker 2:          02:42          We won't go there. Either. You eat. It's advantageous to be young. You've got potential disadvantageous to be old. You've got wealth health. That's a good one. Sex women have advantages. Men have advantages. Maybe one has more than the other. It's not self evident. Women live about eight years longer there. Athleticism, well, family structure, friendship, education, well then there's the classic, you know, postmodern once, race, ethnicity, etc. Why not those other dimensions of variation. There's no evidence that they're less important. In fact, there's quite a bit of evidence that they're more important, so like Why not consider them? Then you get intersectionality. This is one of the things that's really comical I think because the postmodernists identity politics types actually realized this. They thought, well, okay, race and gender.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Fair enough.

Speaker 2:          03:39          What if you're. What if you're a black woman? Well, that's a problem because, well now you've got two dimensions of differentiation. What the hell are we going to do about that? And what if you're, what if you're gay and black and female? Well then what if you're not very bright and gay and black and female, and then what if you're ugly and not very bright and gay and black and female, and like you can keep playing that game. You can keep playing that game and an infinite number of ways because there's an infinite number of ways to categorize things. As The postmodern authority pointed out, and so the intersectionality theorist came along to plug the hole, but they don't know where they're going. They don't understand that the logical conclusion of intersectionality is individuality because there's so many different ways of categorizing people's advantages and disadvantages that if you take that all the way out to the end, you say, well, the individuals, the ultimate minority, and that's exactly right and that's exactly what the west discovered and you know the intersection lists, so get there if they don't kill everyone first, so onto white privilege.

Speaker 2:          04:46          So it's really interesting to find out where these ideas come from because it's usually the scholarship is so awful, you just cannot possibly believe it. It's just absolutely. It wouldn't. In at the university of toronto, in the psychology department, the original paper on white privilege wouldn't have received a passing grade for the hypothesis part of a undergraduate honors thesis. We're not even close. There's no methodology at all. The person who wrote It, it was called white privilege and male privilege. A personal account of coming to see correspondences through work in women's studies. Well, first of all, personal account, it's like, sorry. No, I'm

Speaker 2:          05:32          so she, she listed a bunch of ways that she thought she says these are personal personal examples of her unearned privilege or unearned privilege that she saw as she experienced in the 19 seventies, 19 eighties. So this part of the way. So this idea is the opinion of one person who wrote one paper that has absolutely no empirical backing whatsoever, which is a set of hypotheses which had never been subject to any statistical. Like if I ask you a bunch of questions, it's not obvious how many questions I'm asking you because I could say, how tall are you? Or I could say, if you're laying on the ground, how extended would you be? Like that? Two questions. It's like, no, it's one question. It's just asked two ways and the way you figure out if you ask someone a bunch of questions, how many questions you're asking them is by doing something called a factor analysis, which is kind of in an elementary form now of social science investigation.

Speaker 2:          06:24          If you make a questionnaire, you have to subject it to a factor analysis because you've got to find out how many questions you're asking because you might think it's 60, but it's probably not. It's probably five. That's the big five, by the way. Anyways. Who cares about that? There's no such thing as methodology. Anyways, that's all part of the oppressive white male european patriarchy, so we can just not bother with that and we can pin a few notes about how we think the world is constructed and then we can screw up the entire political system two decades later. Okay, so here's your white privilege lists. Some of it. There's like 50 things I can if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race, most of the time, if I should need to move, I can be pretty sure of renting or purchasing housing in an area which I can afford and in which I would want to live.

Speaker 2:          07:11          That's actually a wealth thing. By the way. I can be pretty sure that my neighbors in such a location will be neutral or pleasant to me. I can go shopping alone most of the time, pretty well assured that I will not be followed or harassed. I can turn on the television or open to the front page of the paper and see people of my waist race widely represented when I'm told about our national heritage or about civilization, I am shown that people of my color made it what it is. There's 50 of those I think something like that. Okay. Is that white privilege? Is that like majority privilege?

Speaker 2:          07:45          It's the same tree. You go to China, you're chinese. Is the same? True. If you're chinese, does the majority privilege benefits? Majority privileges. Like isn't that just part of living within your culture? So let's say you live in your culture, you're privileged as a member of that culture, while obviously that's what the culture is for. That's what it's for. Why would you bother building the damn thing if it didn't accrue benefits to you? Now you mighT say, well, one of the consequences that it accrues fewer benefits to those who aren't in the culture. yeah, but you can immediately associate that with race. You can't just do that. Say it's white, privileged does many things it could be certainly could be well and the intersectional people have already figured out that there's many things that could be so like what the hell? Seriously, well what's going on while we let these pseudo disciplines into the university because we're stupid and guilty seriously and they have no methodological requirements and plenty of power and plenty of time to produce nonsensical research and produce like resentful activists and now we're bearing the fruits of that.

Speaker 2:          08:53          IT's not pretty so privilege. Well, the other thing you might notice is that to attribute to the individuals of a community, the attributes of that community on the basis of their racial identity is called racism. That's what racism is. There's no other way of defining it. It's attributing to the individual the characteristics of the group as if the group was homogenous. Now the intersection of people have already decided that's not a fair game because there's so many differences between people, but the postmodernist don't care about logical coherence because they regard logical coherence. Here it comes again as a creation of the white european male patrIarchal structure that's designed to oppress the oppressed, and that's technically the case. So logical, incoherence, it doesn't matter, and you could say, well, if you act out your logically incoherent ideas in the world, you're going to run face first into a brick wall, and the postmodern answer to that is there's actually no real world. It's all interpretation. So there's no, there's no having that discussion, but the modernists don't care because they don't believe that discussion between people of different power groups as possible. Anyways. So here we are. Well, so I made a case tonight, you know, I'll go over it. What's the case?

Speaker 2:          10:15          The postmodernists are wrong. They're philosophically naive, they're right about an infinite number of interpretations and wrong about a finite number of viable interpretations and that's like that's, that's death. That's the end of postmodernists theory and that's not the only way in which they're wrong. They're wrong and a bunch of other ways, but they're more subsidiary. The marxists.

Speaker 2:          10:40          They're not just wrong. They're wrong and murderous or wrong, murderous and genocidal. Unless you think murderers and genocidal doesn't mean wrong, and you can think that there's lots of would be revolutionaries who would be happy to have blood running in the street if they had their chance for revenge and the opportunity to move up the hierarchy of charity so you can. You don't have to think that murder and genocide is wrong, especially if the right people are murdered in genocided. Right? That's actually part of the part of the whole equation. But if you're willing to think that murder and genocide on a mass scale across many cultures, over many decades is wrong. Then marxism is wrong and the postmodernist don't get to just come along and adopt marxism as a matter of sleight of hand because they're marx's theory didn't work out and they figured out a rationalization. They don't get to get away with that because it's too dangerous. IT's too dangerous to the rest of us and we don't and it isn't necessary for us who are trying with the small part of our hearts that might be oriented towards the good to allow people who are manipulating us with historical ignorance and philosophical of hand to render a so god damn guilty about what our ancestors may or may not have done so that we allow our shame and our guilt to be. To be used as tools to manipulate us into accepting a future that we do not want to have.

Speaker 2:          12:10          And that's that.

Speaker 1:          12:14          Thank you.
