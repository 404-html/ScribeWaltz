Speaker 1:          00:00          And so as far as I'm concerned, the working class needs a voice

Speaker 2:          00:06          and

Speaker 1:          00:08          it isn't obvious that they have one at the moment. Having said that, however, it isn't obvious to me at all

Speaker 1:          00:20          that the people who purport to stand for the working class actually do so or that if they do so, that the reason they do so is because they're all compassionate and sympathetic and loving and kind and St. like I'm more convinced by Orwell's argument. So back to the NDP, the people I met at the leadership level, a lot of them I had a fair bit of admiration for. But as I worked with the party over about a five year period, there's this contradiction that Cape kept emerging for me. And that was that I didn't really like the low level party functionary activist types. Like they just weren't personally appealing to me. They seem peevish and resentful. And then at the same time I was going to college, I was about 17. I got elected to the Senate on the College Board of Governors. And at that time Alberta was conservative politically right?

Speaker 1:          01:14          It still is of course, but they. It was part of the progressive conservative empire because they ruled Alberta forever and all the board of governor members were basically nominees, right? They were conservative nominees, so these were conservative people and I was an NDP member and I thought when I'd worked for small business men too, who weren't NDP, they were. They were conserved. I've never figured that out. I'll tell you about that in a minute, but I had a bad case of cognitive dissonance because actually turned out that I admired the people on the board of governors and they were mostly. It was in grand prairie. It's not a very big place and it's not very old. And so if you were reasonably successful in grand prairie, the probability that you would inherited your money from the arrest to across aristocracy was zero because there wasn't one. Right. The whole damn town was 50 years old. So if you had any influencer or wealth, you are a small businessman, small to middle sized businessmen and you'd. You knew what you were doing. And I actually admired these people and I thought, well, that's not very good. I mire them and I don't share their political views. And then there's these other people with whom I hypothetically share political views and I don't admire them at all. What's going on? And then I read road to Wigan pier and I thought, oh, that's it.

Speaker 1:          02:35          They don't like the poor. They just hate the rich. It's not the same thing. It's not the same set of motivations. And so let's say that you're a postmodernist and you privileged compassion for the oppressed. Think, well, what do you pushed to the margins? Well, what are you doing with all your hatred and your resentment and your evil? It's like you don't any of that. That's a bad theory. That's a really bad theory. Okay, so fine. So you can say, well yeah, you can say that, but I don't buy it. I still think that the people who stand to speak for the oppressed are in fact motivated by empathy and sympathy. Their hearts are in the right place. See, I don't really buy that either because I don't really think generally speaking that it's a credible claim for someone to make that their heart is in the right place.

Speaker 1:          03:32          Now you can ask that of yourself and if you think your heart is in the right place, well more power to you. You know, I, I, I can't see the halo from here. However, and so given that you're just as malevolent as your neighbor or maybe even more so and that that's actually pretty malevolent given the intrinsic nature of human beings. I can't help but wonder what you're doing with all those traits that you're not admitting to, but you can. You could even object. Well, you know, that's a pretty pessimistic view of human kind. It's not by the way, it's just not naive, but anyways, you could object that and you can say no. Actually, the weight of moral authority is in fact on the left, the radical left with those who identify with the oppressed and who are working better, their conditions. Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:34          fair enough. So then let's say, well, let's give those people some power and if they're actually motivated by compassion and empathy and desire for the working class, if you give them power and you give the ideas power, then as those ideas unfold in real time, you're going to find out better for the working class, let's say, or did they get worse? Because we could. We could consider that like an experiment. We could consider the come proof. I don't know what else you would do. I don't know how else you would. You would come to your decision because it's just theory until you see it happen.

Speaker 1:          05:13          Now. Niches sat back in the 18, late 18 hundreds that after he said that God was dead. And I suppose that would also mean the theory that of suffering that I outlined at the beginning that is that the basis of Judeo Christian civilization, the Guard was dad in the people had killed him and that we'd never find enough water to wash away the blood. It's a paraphrase. But I, I've got the basic message, right? And he also said there'll be two consequences of that nihilism because there's no transcendent meaning and a move to totalitarianism because people can't tolerate nihilism. He said the most likely pathway to totalitarianism would communism. Essentially. He didn't quite use those words, but

Speaker 2:          06:02          he meant that

Speaker 1:          06:04          he words are close enough. He said socialism, but I'm going to use communism to distinguishing it, distinguish it from Democratic Socialism. And he said that probably tens of tens of millions of people would die in the 20th century as we played out that experiment. And then he said, but it might be worth it if we learn something from it.

Speaker 1:          06:25          Rough man. I mean, and, and unbelievable. Like I cannot figure out how in the world he knew that that was going to happen. Especially so far in advance. But Dostoevsky knew the same thing. He wrote this book called the Devil's are the possessed. You could read that. That's a great book. It takes about 150 pages to get going. But once it like everything, everything snaps together after that. And then it moves. And it's basically his prophecy about. It's an examination of the kind of person who had arisen in the aftermath of the death of God in Russia who would lead the communist revolution. That's essentially it. It's brilliant. It's, it's, it's terrifying, and it's a great intro to soldier Knutson's Gulag archipelago, which describes what did happen when those sort of people took over the revolution. So let's look at what happened after the revolution and we might say, well, this, how about we replicate the experiment a few times because you know how it is. If you're running this scientific experiment, you want to find out what something does if you allow it to behave, you don't want to just run it once because while maybe there was something specific about those conditions that lead to the outcome. You want to generalize it across multiple circumstances. So we might say, well, let's take this set of ideas and let's, uh,

Speaker 1:          07:47          let's run it on large scale over a very long period of time in a variety of exceptionally diverse cultures and languages.

Speaker 2:          07:56          So let's do that.

Speaker 1:          07:58          Okay, well we can first start with the with the Soviet people even now because it's like the 100th anniversary of the Russian revolution are celebrating Lennon. It's like, that's not good. That's like celebrating Hitler. Okay, I'm dead serious about that. It's not good, and the fact that people can dare to think that that's okay means that there's something wrong with the way that we look at history. Landon was a monster and if you want to know about that, you can read Solzhenitsyn's writings about lending because they communist apologist say, well, it wasn't landing. Lennon was a good guy. He was all motivated by love of the working class. It's like, well, his henchmen was stolen and if you're Hansman is Stellan, you're not a good guy. And and London was around during the early collectivization and if you read what he wrote, you'll find out he is perfectly willing to have any number of people die as long as his ideological system could be brought into big. So there's no celebrating Lennon. There's no work, cool young Marxists, hip revolutionaries, and he's our idol. It's like there's none of that. Not if you know anything, not if you're decent,

Speaker 1:          09:17          whether it's death of the Kulaks I told you about that there was the Ukrainian famine. That's $6 million gone there. There was the rise of the Gulag state because it turned out that Russia, the Soviet Union couldn't run on the principles that it had that had had a laid down as sacrosanct that just didn't work. So you had to enslave everybody and run your economy as a slave state essentially.

Speaker 1:          09:43          And try not to kill the people into gulags so fast that you can't suck some productive labor out of them is the death of tens of millions of people. We don't even know. The estimates range from 15 to $60 million and like we won't get too picky picayune about the numbers because after the first 10 million you kinda made your point and the fact that we don't know between 15 and 60 is actually an indication of the horror of it because our count is off by tens of millions and that's only within the last century. And then there was the 1956 crackdown on Hungary and the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. Then there was the whole like thermo nuclear Holocaust thing that was going on at the same time, and the fact that in 1962 and in 1984, we were seconds away from complete annihilation, right during the Cuban missile crisis, the keys were in the intercontinental ballistic missile release systems. And Castro, as he admitted to Jimmy Carter in case any of you are Castro fans, which you shouldn't be, that he was perfectly willing to have Cuba annihilated if it would've meant the defeat of the United States. And then in 1984 approximately, I may have the date exactly wrong, the Russians received an indication from their early warning systems that the Americans had launched five Thurman Nuclear Missiles and one Russian decided that it was a mistake and refused to launch the retaliation. And he just died about two weeks ago.
