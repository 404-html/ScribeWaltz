Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, so that's a big mistake that the postmodernist made. That's not trivial. That's a big mistake, but it's not the only one. Well, here's another one. They don't like inequality. Well, who does? I'm against poverty. You know, that's like classic protest sign. It's like, really? It's like I'm against torture. It's like it's so obvious. You don't get any Brownie points for being against poverty. No one in their right mind is for poverty. You know, you ever watched the simpsons? You ever see the Republican Party in the simpsons, they all meet in an old haunted castle at night with like lightning bolts going off and there's a vampire and a crazy texts and then even the Simpson Republicans don't sit around in the haunted tower at midnight saying, Hey, we need more poverty. Here's an interesting thing. So one of the postmodernists claims is that diversity is necessary and they make it racial and they make it sexual. They may get ethnic and all of that. That's actually technically incorrect by the way, because I study individual differences. So those are the differences between people. I know the literature. So you know about James Damore memo right from Google. He wrote that partly because he was watching my videos, which is why he wanted me to interview him and I'm a believer that there are biological differences in temperament between men and women apart from the other obvious differences and that they're actually not trivial

Speaker 1:          01:42          and that they maximizing the societies that have the most have moved farthest to producing egalitarian states, the Scandinavian countries, and that. The reason for that is that there's two reasons why men and women, different temperament. One is biological and the other is environmental, and if you remove the environmental variation, which you do, if you make the state egalitarian, you maximize the genetic variation and that's been demonstrated in the scientific literature over about four decades and no one wanted it or hope for it and they weren't biased and looking for it because that was exactly the opposite of what social scientists wanted to find. Because social scientists lean heavily to the left and what they wanted to find was you flatten out the state so that everyone has equal opportunity and the differences between people disappear. That is not what happened. The opposite happened that wasn't wrong and no one was happy about it and no one's happy about it. Now you can actually tell when you've discovered something in the social science because you're not happy about it, but

Speaker 1:          02:50          if you take, let's say there's a big difference between men and women in terms of trait, agreeableness, compassion and politeness on average, women are more than men and the difference is approximately this. If you take random pairs of men and women out of the population, let's say you had to make a back on who was more agreeable. If you bet that it was the woman, you'd be right 60 percent of the time. Well, that's not that much. It means you'd be wrong. Forty percent of the time. That's almost 50 percent of the time. So this is a big difference by social science standards, but that's the magnitude of the difference. There are some differences that are bigger, like the difference between men and women's interest in people versus things is actually bigger than that. That's the biggest difference we know, but it's a big difference. Let's say the agreeable this difference, but still they the shared attributes of men and women far outweigh the attributes that differentiate them because you could ask are there more differences with any groups or between them?

Speaker 1:          03:50          Now the postmodern answer to that is between them. That's why you need diversity by group, right? That's why you need different races. That's why you need different ethnicities and sexual preferences and all of that. Well, that's wrong. There's moral difference within the groups than there is between them. You don't get diversity by crossing the groups. You get diversity by, by selecting across individuals. In fact, the idea that there is more differences between groups said there is between individuals is actually the fundamental racist idea. It's the fundamental racist idea, which is, well, let's say you're Asian Oriental to use the old word to discriminate the one type of Asian say from the other. You're so different from me that there's no overlap between our groups and you're also so different and there's so little difference within your group that now that I know that you're not me, you're not one of mine. I actually know what you're like, no, technically that's incorrect. That's wrong. That isn't how you get diversity. Now, diversity is actually necessary because people differ in intelligence and a different temperament and the different skills and so you actually need diversity because otherwise you can't take advantage of all those differences,

Speaker 1:          05:12          so you need diversity, but you need genuine diversity and like what would genuine diversity mean? If you're trying to put together a work team, you want enough, you want people have sufficient diversity so that they more or less so that you gathered together the appropriate talent to produce the implement that's necessary to work properly in the world. That's a competence marker because otherwise your business is going to fail and so the proper diversity with regards to employment is the diversity that meets the requirements of the business essentially. Obviously that's why you try to hire people carefully and not randomly. Let's say third year our first errors. There's only a finite number of valid interpretation. Second error is that there are real differences between groups of people, but there's more differences within the groups. Then between them. Third Difference is social status and payment, especially in a free democratic capitalist society is based more on competence than on

Speaker 2:          06:22          power.

Speaker 1:          06:23          In fact, we would say that when a person in a hierarchy starts to act like their position, entitles them to power, then that hierarchy has become corrupt. Harvey Weinstein is a good example of that. I'm serious. It's like he aksed acted like a tyrant. What happened to him? It's not good, not good for him. What he did was not good, but it's an indication. It's revealed. It's an indication that that misuse, so he's competent, fine. He gets to have position because we need people who are competent, but that doesn't mean you get to turn into a tyrant. If you turn it into a tyrant, then that overshadows your competence and you go. That's the definition of a functioning state and our state essentially functioned. It's not perfect, that's for sure,

Speaker 2:          07:16          but compared to what?

Speaker 1:          07:20          That's the issue compared to your hypothetical Marxist Utopia, while compared to your hypothetical Marxist Utopia. I mean, we're living in Auschwitz, but your but your actual Marxist utopia is indistinguishable from Auschwitz, so we're not listening to that comparison. We're going to take a look at what we have and we're going to compare it to other places that actually existed in time and geographically and by those criteria. It's like, is there another time you'd rather live is another place you'd rather live, I mean a real place and in real time, have you want to live back in 18, 95. Even in the western world where the average person lived on less than a dollar a day. In today's money, you want to live like those coal miners like the answer to that is no. If you have any sense, you should have some gratitude. That's another problem with the postmodern neo Marxists like zero, zero, zero gratitude. It's all, oh my God, I'm more pressed. Of course you're oppressed, but you're not impressed by the Patriarchy for God's sake.

Speaker 1:          08:30          So you have status in the hierarchy. You might say, well, that's like a reward to your a high status person. It's a reward. That reward should be shared equally. It's like a badge of merit that you get. It's a privilege. It's not the reason that in a capitalist society, filthy selfish capitalists put you in the position so they can extract maximum productivity from you and that's exactly why you're there. You get paid, you get paid, so you keep working. Why do we want you to work? Because your work is actually valuable to us and so we're going to pay you so you don't quit. It's not a reward because you're a good guy. It's not a privilege. That's not what it is. You don't hand those things out like merit badges. That's not how it works. The society is setup on selfish principles. We pay people who are competent so they won't stop striving because we want what they can produce.

Speaker 1:          09:22          So you don't just distribute that like like it's a gift. It's not a gift. It's not a gift at all. So that's another place where they're wrong. Social Status and payment is the consequence of the selfish desire of individuals and the group to extract resources of intellect, creativity, and industriousness from those who possess them in excess. Now, of course, it's not 100 percent like that. There's the incompetent people who rise to the top. You can fool people and you can manipulate them and you can act like a tyrant and you know, we might say maybe the system is like 30 percent warped, something like that. It's not much more than that because we can account for people's success across life by looking at their individual differences, intelligence comp, conscientiousness, emotional stability, creativity. We can do a pretty good job of predicting their trajectory. So there's error, some of its health, right? Because sometimes you've got what you need, but you get cut off at the knees or your family members do or you know, some tragic thing befalls you. There's a randomness in the system that accounts for a fair bit of it and then there's a certain amount of corruption. Fair enough, but not so much that the lights go off.
