Speaker 1:          00:00          The basic narrative of human struggle, his oppressor versus oppressed, we use category structures, can constrain that infinite number of interpretations because the basic narrative is an oppressor versus oppressed. We choose those narratives that serve our function as old pressers,

Speaker 1:          00:19          so it's deeply cynical but credible, you know, and you can say if you're not naive that people are motivated by power and that our interpretations of the world can be self serving. I mean we do want to serve ourselves after all because otherwise we die and so and we are centered in one place and so we can't see everything and we're biased. So. So there is the probability that the way that we look at the world will be tainted by narrow self interest and maybe even tainted by ingroup interests beyond narrow, individual self interested. We know this is true, but it's also not all bad. You know, like we a good person takes care of his or her family. What does that mean? It means you prefer your family. Outsiders, you were going to get rid of that. It's a form of prejudice. Like it really is like your choice of sexual partners, a form of prejudice, right? I mean maybe it should be distributed in an egalitarianism manner. Hey, that would be a lot funnier if it isn't a possibility like in, in, in, in, in Huxley's brave new world, that was the rule you, you shared yourself with whoever asked because it was rude not to and you know what it is actually rude not to. It's seriously rude. Now, is that something you want to take away from people? You want that to be distributed in an egalitarianism fashion.

Speaker 1:          01:56          How prejudiced you when you choose someone to sleep with you choose that person and not everyone else. It's the ultimate in prejudice. If you say, well, that's not prejudicial. Oh yes, it is. Usually go for the most attractive partner you can find. Usually go for the healthiest partner. You go for the best person you can find who can tolerate you. It's prejudicial in every possible way so well, so okay, so your self serving and you construct a view of the world that serves those selfserving causes and some of that has to do with power. Fair enough. That doesn't mean it all has to do with power

Speaker 2:          02:39          though.

Speaker 1:          02:40          It means that some of it has to do with power. It's like racism. People are kind of racist or maybe people prefer their ingroup. It's not that easy. Or maybe people prefer the familiar to the novel. You know that I eat that the social psychologists have come up with implicit association test that measures unconscious bias. We don't know what the hell that measures the people who invented that bloody thing. They know. We don't know what it measures. They know it's not reliable. They know it's not valid enough to be used as an individual diagnostic instrument. That's technically the case. They also know that you can't train people out of their unconscious biases because there is not much difference between unconscious bias and instantaneous perception, but they don't really care. I've. I've written to Missouri and Banerji. He's one of the inventors of the IAT several times saying, how about you come out in public and say what you already know? Which is that people are misusing your damn test. Silence. Well, that's partly because her discipline, social psychology is a corrupt discipline as the social psychologists have discovered over the last four years, can be turning themselves inside out, trying to rectify which they haven't

Speaker 2:          03:56          anyways,

Speaker 1:          03:57          we're giving the devil his due. There's an infinite number of interpretations of the world and it's highly probable that you'll lay a self serving one on top of it. Yes, and also that will serve the interests of your group, however you define that, yes, but it only accounts for a fraction of your behavior. There's all sorts of other things at work as well, and you don't get to reduce all human motivations to one motivation power, and then you might also ask, well, why would you want to reduce all human motivations to power it so you can use power? That's why you can justify the use of power. That's force. You don't have to engage in civilized debate. You don't have to give a damn about the facts, especially if you're not a postmodernist because you don't believe in facts anyways. And you might ask, well, why don't you? Hey, I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. Postmodernists don't believe in facts. They believe that the idea of fact is part of the power game that's placed played by the white dominated male patriarchy to impose the theoretical structure of the Patriarchy on the oppressors. It's like I'm not making this stuff up. It's embedded, right? In theory, all you have to do is read it and you find this out so they don't believe in facts. While facts would constrain the use of power, at least that's how it looks to me.

Speaker 1:          05:15          Okay, so fine. We gave the devil his due. There's an infinite number of interpretations and you're likely to use bias compression algorithms on the world and they're likely to be biased in your favor. True,

Speaker 2:          05:30          but

Speaker 1:          05:33          only partly true.

Speaker 1:          05:37          And the difference between India log and the thinker is that a thinker knows the difference between things that are only partly true and things that are completely true. Things are complicated. Like I like to think everything is as complicated as a military helicopter. You have to like. I think it's eight hours of maintenance to keep those things in the air for one because they don't fly there rocks. They plummet. It's really hard to keep them in the air and they're full of parts and if you don't know all those parts, you don't go in there and monkey about with them because they just wreck it and that's just a helicopter, like everything is way more complicated than the helicopter, so you don't just go muck about in there hoping you're going to make it better. That isn't how it works. You need to be competent.

Speaker 2:          06:22          Alright, so look,

Speaker 1:          06:24          here's where the postmodernists are wrong. I think there's three places and they're serious errors. The first is that there is an infinite number of interpretations, but there is not an infinite number of viable interpretation. So there's a very finite number of viable interpretations and I don't think that this is theory. I think that game theorists have already demonstrated this to some degree and it's going to be built into AI systems very rapidly. Okay? So what are the constraints? Okay? First of all, you can't have an interpretation that leads to immediately to your death or your dad. Now, if you want to be dead, that's fine, but if you don't want to be, then you got a lot of limited options, right? You don't get to run naked across an eight lane freeway at night blindfolded because probably you'll be dead. That's a bad interpretation. Okay, so you might say because you're fragile and vulnerable and mortal, that there's a limited number of ways that you can look at the world that don't result in, let's say death or serious damage or agony. That's a bad thing. Agony is a bad thing. Most people agreed on that. So you're constrained by pain and anxiety. At least your interpretations are constrained by pain and anxiety and you know you can make pain worse or better by thinking about it to some degree, but only to some degree. When push comes to shove, pain is your master.

Speaker 1:          07:47          Okay? So that's a big constraint. That's a big, big constraint. Well, but the constraints are worse than that because not only do you not

Speaker 1:          07:56          get to have an interpretation of the world that produces anxiety and suffering right now, but you don't get to have an interpretation of the world that if you iterate it across time produces pain and suffering and so that's, that's a big problem because there's lots of. You could go out tonight and get yourself blind drunk on cocaine and sleep with six hookers and you know, maybe that maybe that'd be a good night. You know, you might not think about it being so good tomorrow, but then maybe your dad have aids in a year or maybe you're addicted to cocaine or maybe you're a street alcoholic or whatever. It's like as an iterable game, that's a downhill. And the thing is you play iterated games. You don't play one, you play iterated games and so your interpretation of the world has to be one that will sustain multiple iterations across time because you have to worry about 40 year old you and 60 year old you.

Speaker 1:          08:46          And that's a big problem. That's a lot of used, stretched over a long period of time and it's worse than that because it's not just you, it's like you and your right and not only so. Not only do you have to take care of yourself now in a manner that allows you to take care of yourself when you're 40, you have to take care of yourself now in a manner that takes care of you when you're 40 so that other people are happy to have you around now and continually so that they'll cooperate and compete with you in a positive way, and so that's getting ridiculously complicated. It's not just you now when you in the future, it's you surrounded by other people doing the same thing now and in the future and there's a lot of other people. It can even just be you and your family.

Speaker 1:          09:30          You know, like like the psychopathic burglar mob that's just not going to go so well, right? Other people are going to object and the world's going to object and so fine. There's an infinite number of interpretations, but it doesn't mean there's an infinite number of viable interpretations. In fact, there are hardly any, there are hardly any playable games. Now, piaget, piaget, the developmental psychologist who's a very smart guy, he pointed out something very interesting. He said, imagine you ran a set of iterated games as a competition and in one iterated game the rule was you bloody well do what I tell you to. And the other one is, well, we'll all get together and decide how we're going to do this. Okay, now we run the competition. Uh, Piaget's claim is you do what I tell you fails. And the reason for that is I have to impose force in order to keep you cooperating.

Speaker 1:          10:21          And the imposition of forest is a cost. It's an efficiency cost. And across time that efficiency cost is going to multiply. And the equilibrated state solution, which is the one where we all agree it wins. Now that's worth thinking about and you can think about that locally. So you've got, you're trying to organize your family, you have a little family conference about who's doing what in the household and what do you. If you want peace and harmony and an iterated game, you get everybody to say, well, here's the tasks and we have to be done. People have to rely on that and then you say, well, which tasks would you do? You have to some how about you and you know which task would you do and everybody agrees and then you say, well, unless you can come up with a better solution, that's the one we're going to go with, and then people can be a little resentful and angry about the conditions of existence where they have to work, but they can't really blame that on anyone else and maybe that's the best solution you can come up with.

Speaker 1:          11:15          And that was piaget's idea of the equilibrium state. It was like it's a voluntary agreement that can be iterated across time. That works at multiple levels of social organization. Man, that's a serious, serious, serious set of constraints. And Piaget, by the way, was looking for a way to reconcile science and religion. He was looking for biological origin to morality and he thought he found it in the idea of the equilibrium state and it's even deeper than that. So imagine this equilibrium state ideas. Actually there's something to it that if you set the the state of property, it will iterate across time so long that it becomes a permanent part of the environment. Hierarchy is exactly. That's exactly what a hierarchies. Hierarchies are $350, million years old. They are not the patriarchal invention of white European Christian males in the last 300 years. There are $350 million years old. They're stable, they're stable solutions to this iterated game problem and they've been around so long that we're actually adapted to the and that's part of the reason we have archetypal representations of the social structure.

Speaker 1:          12:25          So and then we also have archetypal representations of the relationship of the individual to the social structure. Your job as an individual in relationship to the social structure is to embody the social structure, but also to serve as as its eyes and its mouth. So that can update itself wouldn't necessarily. So you take on the mantle of your father, let's say, but he's dead. He's the path he can't see. You can see, so you take the structure that's already there and you modify it where it's necessary and that modification process is necessary or the state becomes too static and collapses and that's why the state has to be subordinate to the individual and that's what Western culture has discovered and we can't just let it go. That's the idea. The logos, that's a big idea and you'd want to live somewhere where you want to live somewhere where the individual is subordinate to the state. It's like, hey, go right ahead. There's lots of places like that, man, emigrate go there. Ninety percent of the world's countries are like that. If you want to live like that, man, go find out what it's like. You don't see immigration going there, that's for sure.
