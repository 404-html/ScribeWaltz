Speaker 1:          00:01          I'm Dr Peterson. Thank you. First of all. It's a great pleasure being here. It's awesome to see you live. I basically got into your work's just earlier this year and I had an original question, but your talk today kind of made me decide to change my mind. I was going to ask, um, do you feel as though would you agree with me in the sentiment that the left has pushed so hard for total control of our society over the last however many years? It's almost to a point where saying 2013 was a different time. Um, would you say that because they pushed so hard, they've created this backlash and the backlash created caused them to backlash back again. So they doubled down with their ideology and then they get, they lose another argument, they lose another ideological war. They knew lose another me more and they double down and they doubled down again and again.

Speaker 1:          00:55          And they can't seem to mean. They can't seem to argue. They can't see, they can't, they don't want to have an intellectual discussion. And as an, an interpretation of what you were saying there is no, there doesn't seem to be any, any, any care of what's right with them. They just want power, they just want, they just want to win. Um, do you, would you agree with the sentiment that they're burning themselves out and creating the mass red pilling of the, uh, conservative movement that we see going on? Would you possibly think that maybe they've committed suicide and, and talks like this, people like yourself, Ben Shapiro and others who talk to people like the subjects that we do the taboo of nowadays? Um, possibly that this, this is the answer to defeat the leftist stranglehold on our society. I will untangle some of that. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:50          So first of all, well, first of all, the first observation is a really interesting one because you know that things can go out of hand very, very rapidly. And the reason they do that is because of positive feedback loops. Now, the thing that Kurzweil talks about is a positive feedback that an intelligent machine makes another intelligent machine that makes another intelligent machine. And that's a positive feedback loop. And that can spiral upwards out of control very rapidly. And that's when polarization is. It's like, I tap you, you tap me, I slapped you, you punch me well up. It goes. Well, I think that's partly why in the New Testament, for example, there's an injunction that says turn the other cheek, resist not evil. Why? Because otherwise you get into a positive feedback loop and then you better look the hell out and things can tilt very, very rapidly.

Speaker 1:          02:42          I mean, all you have to do, look at what happened in World War One. No one expected that. It was like one, one relatively minor member, I think of the aristocracy, if I remember correctly, was assassinated in one minor little country. It's like bang, everything fell apart. And that's positive feedback loops. Right? And so that's what we're in right now and we've got to be. And that's a really chaotic time. And so I would say maintain self control and don't aim to win. Amen. Piece. Because winning, that's not peace. It's better to aim for peace. You know, I've got this talk coming up in November 11th. I'm quite worried about it because I know there's going to be protesters there and that they'd been emboldened by the fact that they shut the torque down before and I want to make a video. I'll probably do it tomorrow, telling everyone that comes to that meeting to like watch their bloody step and stay out of the gutter because you just, we're at, we're at.

Speaker 1:          03:45          We're at a point now where under the wrong circumstances, if the wrong person does the wrong thing, that the consequences will be very great. Now we can't predict which action is going to precipitate that and or even if that will happen, but it's chaotic enough so that it could happen. So you know, also govern yourselves accordingly. Now the problem is, is that there are people who would be happy if there was blood running in the street. They're the same sort of people that shoot up high schools or kill innocent, you know, elementary school kids just to show what they're made of and what they believe. And that's a big problem. But for the rest of us, like hopefully calmer heads can prevail. And so it really is important not to win, it's like fighting with your wife. You don't when you can't, because you have to live with her.

Speaker 1:          04:37          She can't win. But maybe you can solve the problem and bring about peace. And so you've got to practice doing that. Practice restraint now. And remember too that these people that you're talking about who are radical leftist is most of the time, they're not like they're 95 percent like you. And if you pull them out of the mob, they're just like your, your neighbors. Nineteen year old kid who's kind of clueless and rebellious. Right? And who you might even like you put them in the mob, it's a whole different thing. And so you gotta remember that too. Oh, the fear of social isolation kind of how they're acting. I saying no, it's just that they're possessed by these ideas, but, but only partially, you know, you hardly find it full blooded. Absolutely committed radical leftist activist, you know, like there are some, but not very many. Most of it is just fragmentary behavior.

Speaker 1:          05:32          And you have to remember that like when the students come out to protest me was a case, particularly at mcmaster, I have to remember these kids, they're not much different than my kids. They are when they're in a stupid mob behind a hammer and sickle flag, you know, but, but, but you don't want to make a low resolution, homogenous representation of them. And so, and so. That's why again, I think instead of winning, you turn to your own development, you turn to your own development, you do what you can to stop doing the things that you're doing that aren't good because you're not going to hurt anybody if you do that, all you're going to do is help. And otherwise you'll participate in this polarization. And that's unless you want that, you know, there's a dark part of people that it's part of the part that voted for trump would like to burn things to the ground.

Speaker 1:          06:27          It's like the hell I know how people felt when they went into the voting booth. It was like Hillary, Hillary or trump, you know? And that's a, that's a hell of a thing to say to hell with it, you know, although I could, I could certainly understand that sentiment. So we have to be careful and all of you people who are here who are advocates of free speech and who are theoretically happy to come hear me speak, it's like I really do believe in. I truly believe this and this is something I learned in part from social knits and then part from y'all missed that the way that you set the world straight is by constraining the malevolence in your own heart. And that's no joke, man. That's no easy thing and that's a good voyage for people to go on if they want something difficult and worthwhile to do. So. Thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          07:16          Okay, just a quick thing. We're not gonna have time for pictures, so you're. Unless you're yours is the last question. Okay. So sorry to everybody else, but you're the last one. Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:32          Hi Dr Peterson. Thanks for coming. Uh, my question is a little bit off topic from everything else tonight, but I really wanted to hear what you had to say about it. I work in residence life here at UBC and in the community where I am. We were recently affected by a suicide of someone who lived in our community and that I was upset about it, not just because obviously it's a horrible thing to have happen, but also because Rez life in the university, like they talk all this talk about self care and your mental health is so important to us. But then things like this still happen. So I wanted to know, like if you think like, what do you think the university should be doing to keep stuff like this from happening in the future? Well, it's not self evident that it's the university's responsibility and the reason for that. I'm not saying it isn't. Okay, I'm, I'm saying it's not self evident that it is because different institutions can only do so many things and we are already recording the universities to educate and to act as substitute parents increasingly. And to take on the role of judge, jury and executioner as

Speaker 3:          08:52          there are more,

Speaker 1:          08:56          what should be criminal cases being handled within the university? Say,

Speaker 3:          09:01          um,

Speaker 1:          09:05          having said that, you could ask the broader question is, well, what do you do to help people be sufficiently in love with life so that they don't wish to end it now? And I've tried to puzzle through that for a long time and that's partly why I've written the things that I've written. It's partly why I've produced the online programs that I've produced, you know, and so we know that if you do, if you have students do the future authoring program, for example, they're much less likely to drop out of university about 30 percent less likely and their grades go up. And that's especially true if they're male and marginalized. It has a bigger impact on those communities. And so, you know, I've tried to get university's interests now the data's there, but they're not. And it's very difficult to get a big bureaucracy to move.

Speaker 1:          09:51          A big, big is a mobile. So I'm not sure if there's anything they can really do about it that it's certainly possible that the things that they're trying to do about it or making it worse, you know, that's another thing that you learn if you're a good social scientists, just like there was evidence, and I don't know if this is still the case, but. But there was good evidence. I looked into this about 15 years ago. Say you want to prevent suicides, suicide hotline in your town and you advertise it. What happens? Suicide rate goes up because you're advertising suicide, right? And lots of lots of interventions are like that. It's really, really hard to make things better and it's really, really easy to make them worse. And so that's another problem. You get these big bureaucracies, let's say, and there hypothetically motivated by positive intentions and I would say hypothetically again, because it takes an awful lot of work to help someone straightened out. It's no joke, especially if they're in real trouble and they put in place these structures that are designed to help but they don't ever evaluate them and they could easily be making it worse. So,

Speaker 1:          11:02          so I don't have a straightforward answer to that question.

Speaker 3:          11:05          Um, I think that.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Well that's, that's the only answer I have. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Yep.

Speaker 2:          11:14          Okay. So that's the end of the show. If you're in the first two rows, you can stick around and get some pictures. Otherwise, a drive safe and yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:22          Thank you.
