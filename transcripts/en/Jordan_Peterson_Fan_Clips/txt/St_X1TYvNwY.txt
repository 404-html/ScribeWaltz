Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, people say that's worth more than money and that's worth more than money. I know lots of people who have lots of money and let me tell you, money protects you, your as well protected from the world by money right now as you ever will be for the rest of your life because there's most of life's fundamental problems can't be solved with money. You know, like rich people get divorced, they have affairs, their children get sick, that they have all the problems you have, and that's partly because you're already rich and so

Speaker 1:          00:30          you might think that if you had a bunch of more money, things would be better, but it's just not true. In fact, in some ways that they might be worse because money can open up, can open up the possibility of all sorts of temptations to you that you just can't afford at the moment. So well. So like economic economics, we've already solved that problem fundamentally and we're rapidly solving it everywhere in the world, right? I mean, the world economy is growing so damn fast that you can't even imagine how you could possibly make it grow any faster. It's crazy. We've lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the last 15 years. You know, the UN set a goal by 2015, I think it was to cut poverty by half if I remember correctly. And they reached two years early. You know, it's like, it's unbelievable. So.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Well. So then I started to try to understand what it might be to, to live and, and really what I was looking forward to was not so much to live a life that was wise, but at least to live a life that wasn't pathologically unwise. And I thought of the sorts of things that people were doing to one another in the Auschwitz camps and in the Gulag archipelago and all of that horror that was perpetrated on, on people as definitely unwise. Whatever else you might say about it was unwise. And so then I thought, well maybe there's a way to figure out how you could not do that. And so that's. And I think that that's my sense is that when you come to university to learn how to be a civilized person, which is what supposed to happen at university, otherwise it's just a trade school and you might as well go to trade school as far as I'm concerned. If you want to learn something that will get you a job, it's like it's a lot faster and it's more certain and, and it's useful. If you're not being taught to be a citizen at university, then

Speaker 1:          02:29          why bother with it so? Well. So that's what we're trying to figure out. And, and that's part of that cloud of mythological fantasy that surrounds our culture. That's part of its deep history that we're trying to, you know, if you grapple with the humanities and with art and all of that, that you're trying to, you're trying to master and incorporate and, and, and pull into you so that you're situated properly in history and, and you're not just floating in the void of, of, you know, this tiny individuality that's divorced from everything else. You're weak and that circumstance. Right? So

Speaker 1:          03:15          that's more of an explanation of why I'm trying to puzzle through these things and trying to puzzle through them with you. So anyways, we talked about this, this, this song last week and you know, I, I made a hypothesis to you. We'll, we'll go through this quickly. It's Doggerel. It's not great poetry, but it's irrelevant. It was a very popular song. It's quite beautiful in the movie. It's actually sung by like a heavenly choir. That's what it sounds like. So it's got this cathedral. You could imagine people singing it in a cathedral essentially. And so that's not accidental. It's purposeful, you know, it, it, it partakes of that, what would you call it? It, it partakes of that aesthetic, that that's, that's it. So the, the filmmakers are, are implying that what is about to be shown to you has this divine element essentially, and that that's signified by the choir of voices that sings this song.

Speaker 1:          04:20          And the song says fundamentally something like this is that if you lift up your eyes above the temporal, into the transcendent, and so that's what exists in the heavenly world in the stars. If you pick a an ultimate goal, if you pick the right ultimate goal, then and you know anyone can do this. That's the other thing. It's democratic. It's, it's anyone can do this, so that's, that's the second proposition. It doesn't matter who you are, you can do this, and so I think that's a reflection of the idea of the divinity of the individual. It's like there's something about each individual that's valuable regardless of their idiosyncrasies and so they have this potential that they can manifest. And how do you manifest it? Well, you pick the right goal and what's the right goal? Well, it's, it's high, it's elevated, it's above the mundane.

Speaker 1:          05:10          Now what does that mean? Well, you don't really know. You don't really know. That's why it's signified by a star and a star is something that glimmers in the night, right? So it's a source of light in the darkness. And so there's a metaphor there. Obviously there's a metaphor there and the star is the star that the star of Hollywood, you know the person that you emulate. That's part of it because it's an ideal is it's going to be a human ideal, some sort that you're aiming at and so the ideal human being is, is the star that you're aiming at? Maybe it's something like that. If that's what you're aiming at, you might say, well, what should you aim at in life? And wanting to answer as well, why don't you aim at being whatever you could be. That would be the best. No, you don't know what that is exactly because how do you, you know, but you could think, well that would be really good if I could have it.

Speaker 1:          06:01          And then you could say, well, can I think of anything better than that? And if the answer is no, then well why not go for that? You know? And you might say, well it's too ambitious. It takes too much responsibility. It's like, yeah, yeah, that, those are definitely problems. And one of the things that I've figured out over the years is that if you offered the person the opportunity, you know, because people say, well, life doesn't really have any ultimate meaning. It's like, yeah, okay, fine. So far, let's say it has an ultimate meaning, but that in order to experience that ultimate meaning, you have to take on ultimate responsibility for what you do. Well, that's a heavy price to pay, to have a meaningful life, you know, and you might say, well, there's no damn way I'm going to do that. I'll just go for the, you know, pointless. Ah,

Speaker 1:          06:50          I'll go for that. The trivial pointless perspective, which you know, was kind of hard on me existentially, but it frees me up. I can do whatever the hell I want moment to moment. I don't have any ultimate responsibility. And so then you think, well that's kind of a good deal. And then then. But that raises this weird specter of doubt, which is why when you hear people talk about the ultimate futility of life, is it because life is ultimately futile? Or is it because they've decided that they would just assume not adopt the responsibility and they use that real decision, which is to not adopt the responsibility. They rationalize that by proposing that life is ultimately meaningful, meaningless and like, you know, I kind of by that I really do think that's what's going on so, but maybe not, but it could be that if you want to have an ultimately meaningful life that you have to adopt ultimate responsibility. Makes Sense. What might that mean? Well, one thing it might mean is that, and I do think it means this is it.

Speaker 1:          07:55          I think it was Alexander Pope, but I might be wrong about that. Who said nothing human is foreign to me and that's a hell of a statement, right? Because if you think about all the things that human beings are capable of, they're capable of some, like if you really want to know what people are capable of, you should read about read about unit seven slash 31, but I would not recommend it because if you read it, you will never forget it and you will be sorry that you read it, but you'll know anyways to say that nothing human is foreign to you. That's a hell of a thing to say because that means that what other people have done you could do, and that also means you need to take responsibility for that. That's no joke. You know, it's a big deal to do that and even trivial manner anyway, so the idea is that you can elevate.

Speaker 1:          08:45          If you elevate your viewpoint to some transcendent ethic, you want what's ultimately good. You really want that. Whatever that is you don't know, but that's what you're even out says that, well then it says this strange thing that, well, what you want, we'll all of a sudden come to you. Well, that's a proposition and it's the proposition that's basically played out in the movie. It's a hypothesis. The hypothesis is the best way to Orient yourself in life is to orient yourself towards the highest good that you're capable of imagining and then aim at that and then things will work out the best way they can for you. And I think, I believe that's correct. My, my observation of life has led me to see that that seems to be correct. So for example, you don't get something you don't aim at that just doesn't work out and so lots of people are not thinking that's what they get.

Speaker 1:          09:35          So if you aim at something, you have a reasonable crack at getting it, you know, you tend to change what you're aiming at a bed along the way because like what are, you know, you know, game there, you're wrong, but you get a little closer and then the aim there and you're still wrong, you get a little closer and the aim there and you know, as you move towards what you're aiming at, your, your characterization of what to aim at becomes more and more sophisticated. And so it doesn't really matter if you're wrong to begin with, as long as you're smart enough to learn on the way and as long as you specify a goal. So I specify a vague what I want things to be the best they could be and I'm willing to learn what best means as I go along. Okay? So fine. And then you get what you truly need will say, well, maybe not.
