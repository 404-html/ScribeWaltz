Speaker 1:          00:00          There was a cat that they recently discovered, a prehistoric cat that had this bottom single tooth and they found out that if a human skull fit right inside its mouth and so it could grab you here and Pierce the back of your skull with its, with its single tooth and that's what it was evolved for. So you know, it's under such conditions we evolved and we're predators obviously, but were tasty predators and so other things were perfectly happy to eat us. And so when you're aware you don't know what to do, you act like a prey animal and that's probably what you should do because maybe if you keep your head down and shut the hell up, there will be any attention to attracted to you and maybe you'll get through it. You know, you might decide unlikely to intervene and take the guy down, but, but you would be the exception rather than the norm. And it's unsurprising.

Speaker 1:          01:09          Okay. So what I came to understand was the belief systems regulated emotions, but not exactly psychologically like it isn't exactly. It isn't. Exactly. And this is sort of like the terror management theories. It's not exactly like you have a theory in your head and the theory explains the world and because of the theory explains the world. The theory is what's making you secure. It's kind of like that. It's like you have a theory in your head and the theory makes you feel secure because it explains the world, but the reason that explains the world is because other people have the same theory in their head and then when you both act out the theory, you both get what you want and it's the. It's the coming together of the theory and the outcome that makes you.

Speaker 1:          01:56          It's life. Not only does it stop you from being anxious and often make you happy because you get what you want, but it's not just psychological. You know, the fact that we do this, that we cooperate within our societies. We match our belief systems and then act them out. That's the predicate for a productive society. So it's actually, it isn't just that it saves, saves you from death, anxiety, like the terror management theorists have it. It's, it saves you from death and that's good. I mean, being protected from death, anxiety, oh good, that's great too, man, but actually not dying. That's sort of the fundamental thing that you're after, and so people have reason to defend their territory. If you think of territory that way, as you think about it as a domain where the fundamental presuppositions of each citizen are matched by the behavior of their coast citizens, they have every reason to defend that, and if it falls apart, it can have mortally serious consequences. It's chaos, you know, and that chaos doesn't just destabilize everybody. Psychologically, it destabilizes everything. It can destabilize. The currency can be stabilized, the industrial economy. It can, the lights can go off. It's like it's not good, so hey, no wonder people protect it.

Speaker 1:          03:25          So then I started thinking about what a belief system was and I realized that a belief system was actually a set of moral guidelines

Speaker 1:          03:39          and moral guidelines are guidelines about how you should behave. Also, how you should perceive and the reason that a moral guideline is necessary for you to perceive is that you can't look at anything without a hierarchy of value. Right? Think about it like how many things in this room could you look out? There's an in innumerable things in this room to look at. There's just all this squares, the little tiny squares in this fabric. You could look at those things for til the end of time, one at a time, but you don't do that. In fact, if I took most of you out of this room, there's a very low probability that you'll be. You'd be able to tell me what color the walls were or even if those things were on the walls and the reason for that is that who cares? As long as the walls don't move, colors irrelevant and there's no reason for you to remember it.

Speaker 1:          04:34          It has no emotional significance. It has no value, and so what you do instead is, well, this is what you're doing, so why are you here? I don't mean in the broad metaphysical sense. I mean specifically why are you here right now? And I would say, well, you're a students obviously and you're trying to get a degree and you know, you believe that that will have some functional utility. Maybe you'll be a little wiser and a little more literate and a little and be able to think a little better and be able to write a little better and so you'll actually be more functional in the world. That would be good. You know, and and maybe you're interested in, but anyways, it's. You're in this particular lecture so that you can take this particular class so that you can get a particular kind of degree so that you can launch your life and then in your life you're probably going to meet someone that you have a longterm relationship with and you're going to have children and you're going to partake in the society and that's why you're here.

Speaker 1:          05:33          All of those reasons simultaneously is why you're here. And so then that helps you decide what to look at. And so what you look at is at the moment or listened to is me because in principle, I'm the gateway to that set of accomplishments at this moment. And so you focus on me and that's because you value that. And so what that means is you can't even look at the world without a value structure. You know, it's chaos if everything is equally unimportant or if everything is equally important. It's chaos. And so value system structures the very way that you perceive the world. And I don't mean that metaphysically. There's plenty of experiments that have demonstrated that the invisible gorilla experiment, which, how many of you knew about the invisible gorilla experiment, how many don't?

Speaker 2:          06:31          Well,

Speaker 1:          06:34          roughly speaking, what happens is that there are two teams, a white team dressed dressed in white and the team dressed in black and there's video of them and the black team is passing the basketball back and forth and the white team is passing the basketball back and forth. And you're supposed to count the Times. The basket ball gets passed back and forth. There's only one basketball. And so you know, you're diligent for whatever reason you do what the experiment or asks you and you count the basketball tosses and you think, well that's not so hard. It's like 16. So you tell them 16 and they say, did you see the gorilla? And half of you say, what, what are you talking about? And the experimenter says, well, let's watch again, but this time don't count all. Sure enough, like 30 seconds into the video. And you know, the players fill the video screen.

Speaker 1:          07:24          It's not like they're 300 yards in the distance, you know, like little ants playing basketball there, right? Filling the screen, you can see their faces. Sure enough a minute into the video. This guy in a gorilla suit and he's not little and neither is the gorilla suit. He comes out, bangs his chest right in the middle of the screen for five seconds and then disappears and half more than half actually, if people don't see that and it's even worse down. Simon did another experiment where you're at a counter, you know, at a store and there's a clerk there and you're talking to the clerk and the clerk goes down hypothetically to get something in. A different clerk pops up and you'd think, Hey, I noticed that, but you don't. And you can even vary the clerk quite a bit and people don't notice. So we focus on very particular things. And the reason we don't notice this because it actually doesn't matter in terms of the ongoing, our ongoing action at that point, the clerk is interchangeable as long as the entity there acts like a clerk that's sufficient. So belief system structure, your perceptions, value systems, we're going to call them systems. They structure your perceptions and they also guide your actions because you act in accordance with your values, conscious or unconscious. You have values that you don't know about because you just don't know yourself very well.

Speaker 1:          09:12          The you can tell that, that you have values that you don't know very well because sometimes you get attracted to people that you know, you know perfectly well, that's a mistake. Or you know, you're trying to tell yourself to study and you don't. And you know, so there's, you're not really in control of yourself to any great degree. Some and the more integrated you are, the more control you have. But you know, you're kind of a loose collection of arguing subpersonalities and they're more or less directed towards a single goal. But it depends on how committed you are to that goal. How much you've thought it through, how much you buy into it, how many of the contradictions in your world representation you've managed to iron out and all of that.

Speaker 2:          09:54          So,

Speaker 1:          09:56          but in any case, it's value systems that government action and perception.
