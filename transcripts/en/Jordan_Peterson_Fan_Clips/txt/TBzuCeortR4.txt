Speaker 1:          00:01          Now, you know, it's a truism and probably an oversimplified one that since the dawn of the scientific revolution, a wedge has been driven through the heart of our society such that the moral systems that we use to Unitus, so those would be religious systems fundamentally have been subject to an intense critique from the scientists and you know, it's a pretty effective critique even if you have, even if you've maintained a traditional faith, it's like

Speaker 2:          00:40          you know,

Speaker 1:          00:42          the scientific onslaught is no joke and

Speaker 1:          00:48          that's a problem as far as I can tell because and the problem is that you're still left with the problem of how you should act. And Nietzsche, the philosopher Nietzsche, he would say that we're running on the fumes of Christianity in the West because over it's thousand years of domination to let's say, 1500 years of absolute domination. It produced a consensus of morality that was predicated on metaphysical presuppositions and that organized societies and those societies are predicated on certain beliefs like the belief. And really I would say that something divined inhabits each individual. You know, that's sort of presumption that's embedded in law. It's sort of the idea that underlies the idea of natural, right? Right. There's something about you that's so valuable that even the law has to bow to it. Even if you're reprehensible, even if you're convicted and reprehensible now that's man, the idea that people came up with that idea. That's a bloody miracle. It's because generally speaking, your proclivity is if someone's been even accused of doing something, that general human proclivity is that even if someone's just being accused of doing something terrible, that's enough so that you can stone them to death or do whatever you're going to do with them. Presumption of innocence before guilt, good God, of all the things that aren't automatic, that's got to top the list. You know, it's. It's unbelievable that that occurs, and it's interesting to me because it seems to me that

Speaker 1:          02:22          that presupposition that there's something valuable transcendent about each individual. I wouldn't call that a scientific presupposition, but it seems to be a highly functional presupposition, right? I think in that it isn't unreasonable to notice that societies that have

Speaker 1:          02:42          value the individual and made the law subject to the individual even with regards to voting because that's basically what voting does, put sovereignty in the hands of the people. Those societies actually seemed to work. Now whether they'll work for the next 300 years. Who the hell knows? I don't know them, but they've worked pretty well for the last 500 years let's say, and we've got it pretty good right now and you know, I suspect most of you are rather pleased that the law recognizes your value as individuals and you take that for granted, right? You think you have rights and of course the rights that you have. Natural rights are a logical consequence of your transcendent value and that's nested in this niche niches observation that's nested in a set of metaphysical beliefs. And his idea was that if you wipe out, sorry, you wipe out the metaphysical beliefs eventually wipe out the whole system because you've knocked out the cornerstone and it might take a long time for the thing to shake and fall. But, but it will now whether he was right or not, it's hard to say. It looks to me like what's happened since Nietzsche announced the death of God and say the late 18 hundreds is that western society is oscillated between extremes, extremes on the right Germany, extremes on the left, and you know, with, with the democracies, at least the other democracies, democracies managing to stay the course somewhere down the middle. But,

Speaker 1:          04:28          but it's not obvious to me that that can be maintained without the underlying metaphysics. And that's a problem because whatever you might say about the underlying metaphysics,

Speaker 1:          04:43          it's not true the way science is true. And that could be okay because there might be more than one form of truth. In fact, I think there is a. I think there's pragmatic truth and I think pragmatic truth is actually deeper than scientific truth. And pragmatic truth is the truth that enable you to act in a manner that best. It improves the probability roughly speaking of your existence and your reproduction maximally. That's a Darwinian idea. And one of the things about the Darwinian theory just kind of puts it in opposition to scientific materialism, I would say, is that the Darwinian theory is that you don't have privileged knowledge of the world and you can actually tell that because you die, right? If you knew enough about the world, you wouldn't die and you do die, and so you're an embodied theory of sorts, and that theory is good enough to get you along about 80 years and produced some reasonable probability that you'll have children and that they all survive. That's it, man. That's what you've managed after 3 billion years of evolution. It's a good enough, it's a good enough way of acting and we don't know a better way of acting and our world conceptions are actually nested inside the Darwinian system and they might be predicated on pragmatic truths rather than objective truths. Pragmatic truths are truths that have functional utility and we're alive. We care about being alive. We can to use our theories as tools. It's possible that our theories are tools and that they're tools to help us stay alive.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Now I was reading a bit about Camille Paglia the other day and uh, I've noticed some similarities between, she's a famous gadfly, I would say a feminists have classic modern feminists, although she would regard yourself as a feminist, unbelievably smart. Like if you want to watch someone who's verbally who has verbal mastery beyond belief, it's, you could watch Camille Paglia. She's, she's, she seems a little manic to me. She can wrap off and argument at a rate that's just mind boggling and it's a very coherent and she tends to shred her opponents and arguments. He's so brilliant.

Speaker 2:          07:17          Um,

Speaker 1:          07:19          she said something interesting and she's been influenced by some of the same people that I've been influenced by it. She liked this book by Eric Norman called the origins and history of consciousness, which I would recommend if you're interested in young Ian theory, Carl Young. It's a good introduction to union theory and it's about the development of consciousness and it's predicated like young's work and Joseph Campbell's work and Murcia Elliot is work, all of which has been criticized or ignored by the postmodernist, predicated on id on the idea that human beings have a central narrative

Speaker 2:          07:58          and that

Speaker 1:          08:02          that central narrative is

Speaker 2:          08:05          the

Speaker 1:          08:06          dramatic expression of the necessary human system of values and that that's built into us. It's, it's, it's part of our nature. We have a nature as human beings. We're not infinitely malleable white culture, which is a postmodernist claim and a dangerous one. It's dangerous if we have a nature.

Speaker 2:          08:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:36          Paglia has this idea

Speaker 2:          08:38          that

Speaker 1:          08:40          the reason that you come to university and you studied the humanities or the proper reason if you do that, is not to engage in premature and destructive criticism of something that you don't even yet understand, but to learn as much as you can about

Speaker 1:          09:02          art and literature and poetry and drama and fiction and religious thinking and this is all a kind of a. You think about it as a. What is that? What is all that? It's art culture. Music belongs in that category and like what the hell? What, what about music? It's like everyone loves it or almost every one. It's a mystery. You listened to music and it's very meaningful. I mean music gets people through some pretty dark times. Why it's not obvious, that's for sure. You know when in most cultures, music plays a very central role in identity formation and you guys, I think you'll probably find as you age that your favorite music will be the music that you listened to between the ages of 16 and 20. It's kind of like an imprint on you and it defines a maybe that defines a generation and maybe you know, in our tribal past, and this is highly likely when you were being inculcated into the tribal culture that was inculcated with dance and with masks and with music all at the same time. So you're invited to participate in this drama and to take your place in this drama and to think of that as a representation of the objective world is just not right. That isn't what it is. It's an invitation to a drama.

Speaker 1:          10:28          Now. Then the question might be, well is the drama reel, and the answer to that is depends on what you mean by real. I think that great dramas are more real than real. They're hyper real there. They're hyper real because they provide guidelines about how to act that are abstract and even perhaps generic, but applicable across an extraordinary broad range of situations.
