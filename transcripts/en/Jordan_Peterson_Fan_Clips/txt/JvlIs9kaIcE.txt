Speaker 1:          00:00          The question is what is the stable way of solving how to live together across time and that really is the question and it's part of the question that I'm trying to answer, partly because it's a perennial problem, right? We, we faced the problem of how to organize ourselves in small social units without undue conflict and then we face the larger problem of how to organize ourselves into large social units without undue conflict and that conflict can be absolutely devastating and, and, and frequently is so. So then I would also say that the first way of solving this problem isn't conscious. You see not at all. And you know, you may know and you may not know that there are, there are different forms of memory, right? Really technically different forms of memory. So for example, there's short term working memory, which is the memory that you use to hold things like telephone numbers in your active imagination. It decays very rapidly. It's only about four to seven bits, which is why well, it's white phone numbers or were at least seven digits long. You know, you can kind of manage that as a loop. That and then there's episodic memory and that has two elements. One is semantic and the other is a episodic. It's a. what's the name of that?

Speaker 1:          01:32          Someone's. Someone said something. Yes. Well there's procedural memory and then there's, there's another kind of memory that you use to represent your experiences to yourself. So let's say it's image Laden and the other one is semantic and semantic is your memory for facts and those are quite different. So for example, procedural memory, that's how you ride a bike. That's how you play the piano. That's how you play jazz music. If you're in a combo, it's, it's the memory, it's, it's, it's a funny kind of memory because it's actually built right into you. You know, I mean so is so is the kind of memory that used to represent your own life, but it's much more malleable in some sense. So what that means is that in your procedures there is information that you don't know about pattern information that you don't know about. Part of that is how to act, you know, like when you walk into a social gathering, you don't really think through how you're going to act.

Speaker 1:          02:33          You know, how to act and if someone asked you exactly what it is that you're doing and why you could formulate a story about it, but the probability that, that it's the existence of that story that enabled you to act that way is zero because you have to react way faster than that. And so you know, you have social knowledge built into your nervous system because you've practiced being a social being for a very long period of time. And of course then that social being has been shaped for forever really. And it's the right way of thinking about it. You know, we know that animals organize themselves into hierarchies and we'll say of dominance because it's more true the farther back you go in time, at least since the time of the crustaceans. You know, when we split from our common ancestor 300 million years ago.

Speaker 1:          03:22          And so it's true for social animals and non social animals. So even animals that don't live together in groups have to organize themselves into a hierarchy in this space. They inhabit songbirds are a good example and they have dominance disputes all the time. Partly that's you can hear them having their little dominance disputes in the spring when they're singing because basically what they're saying is I'm pretty damn healthy and now I'm ready to go and if you're another bird like me, you better steer clear of this tree. And, and the, the dominant song birds, you know, they don't live together. Crows social, but most songbirds aren't the dominant song. Birds get the best nest and the best nest is the one that doesn't get rained on and isn't, it's not too windy and it's close to food sources and you know, and so then they have the healthiest chicks and they attract the best mates and like it's really important where you're positioned in the hierarchy, even if you're not like a flock or herd creature.

Speaker 1:          04:19          Now we're more like herd creatures. So it's even more even, it's even more irrelevant to us, but there's just no escaping a hierarchical arrangement in, in, in social being that is social being and, and, and it's evolutionarily ancient beyond conception. So 300 million years ago there weren't trees, you know, I mean, so the dominance hierarchy is older than trees. So that's really something to think about. And then you know, when you're thinking about the reality that shaped us, say from an evolutionary perspective, but also from a cultural perspective, what you have to understand is that the things that have shaped us most are the things that have been around the longest. And so you could say those are the most real things and you can't even see some of them. Like, it's not like you can come in here. Well it's not exactly true. You can't come in here and see the multiple dominance hierarchies that are at work.

Speaker 1:          05:14          You can't in a way because the chairs are set up to face this way and I'm facing that way. That gives you some clues about the social order here and you take the cues instantly, right? You come down, you sit in the chairs, you organize yourselves according to mutual expectation, and that's part of your procedural knowledge about how to behave as a social creature. Now that knowledge is really, really deep and a lot of it's coded in your behavior now and another people's behavior as well and that's you know, that's, that's the expectations you have of other people, end of yourself and a lot of those are implicit, right? So when we're interacting, there's, there's a, there's a very large number of things that you just don't get to and you know that too and you won't do them. And that way we can act as if we understand each other even though we don't because you're really complicated and I'm really complicated and there's lots of situations where we might really be in conflict, but because we share a map of the culture, the cultural expectations, it makes part of our.

Speaker 1:          06:18          It's built right into our perception. You will act out that set of expectations and so will I, and if neither of us can do that, even if one of us can't, we're going to stay. We're either going to immediately devolve into conflict or we're going to avoid each other like the plague, and that's exactly the right thing to do, and so one of the really useful things to understand, and this took me a long time to formulate properly, you know, you hear the terror management theorists for example, and they have this idea that you're, you're meaning representation. The story you tell about the world regulates your death anxiety. It's something like that, but that's not right. I mean it's close to right and it's a smart idea. It came from Ernest Becker, by the way, who wrote a book called the denial of death, which is actually quite a good book even though it's wrong, you know, sometimes a book can be very useful.

Speaker 1:          07:08          It can be usefully wrong in that, and Becker's book is usefully wrong because he thought that it's the internal representation of your belief system that regulates your anxiety and that anxiety is fundamentally in the final analysis anxiety about death. It's like, well, okay, fine. It's a reasonable proposition, but that isn't how it works. You see, it isn't my beliefs right now that are regulating my emotions. It's the fact that I'm acting out those beliefs which include implicit perceptions. I'm acting them out and so are you, and so what you're doing and what I expect more, more accurately, what you're doing and what I want you to do and the way I want you to react to me that's working, so it's the match between my belief system and the way everyone else is acting that's regulating my emotions. It's not the belief system. It's mediated by the social culture and you see if you understand this, then you understand more particularly white people are willing to fight to the bitter end to protect their culture.

Speaker 1:          08:15          It's not a psychological structure that they're protecting. It's a psychological structure and a sociological structures simultaneously, so the social contract is you have a set of expectations and I have a set of expectations. There actually desires. They're not merely expectations because as living creatures, we're desirous, we don't just expect and so you desire and outcome and I desire outcome and we agree to act in accordance with that. That's the social contract, and so people don't like to having that disrupted. Well, it isn't because it's psychologically destabilizes them. Although it does. It's because it actually destabilizes stuff, right? If all of a sudden we can't occupy the same specified domain of territory, it isn't only that we're thrown into psychological disarray, although we will be. It's that will start fighting with each other like, and that can kill you. It's no joke. It kills people a lot.

Speaker 1:          09:14          Like it happens. It can happen very easily, that are cohesive. Social Group can fragment along some fracture line of identity, let's say, and all hell breaks loose. You know, that's what happened with the Tutsis and the Hutu and in, uh, in Rwanda, you know, and those things can get out of control just so fast. It's just unbelievable. And so, and that wasn't death anxiety, that was death. That's a whole different thing. And that's the other thing that terror management people don't exactly get. It's like it isn't just that your culture and your cultural beliefs protect you from anxiety and say anxiety about death. Even it's that they actually protect you from death as well as protecting you from death, anxiety. I mean, look, it's warm in here. It's cold outside. The fact that the culture is intact means that you're not outside freezing. That's a hell of a lot more fundamental in some sense than mere anxiety. Although I'm not trying to underplay the role of anxiety, that's a major issue, but there's something that's a lot more fundamental at stake than mere psychology, so it's the match between your map of the world and other people's actions that regulates your emotion and it regulates it completely.
