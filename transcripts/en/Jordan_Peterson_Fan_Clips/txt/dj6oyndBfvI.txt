Speaker 1:          00:00          And you know, because of that you all think, well, you're in control of yourself, but don't be thinking that that's just not right. I mean if you look at how the brain is structured, for example, the Hypothalamus, which is a really important part of the brain, it basically, it basically establishes the framework of reference and the actions, the framework of reference within which, and the actions you take in order to fulfill basic biological needs. So the hypothalamus makes you thirsty and the hypothalamus makes you hungry and it makes you sexually aroused. If it puts you into a state of defensive aggression and it, it actually also makes you explore and be curious. All of that, hypothalamic. It's an amazing structure. And then, and, and it's really small and it's right at the base of the brain. Um, and you could imagine it as something that has tremendously powerful projections upward throughout the rest of the brain into the emotional systems and the cortical systems and all of that, like tree trunk size connections, you know, metaphorically speaking.

Speaker 1:          01:00          And then the cortex has these little like vine, like tendrils going down to regulate the hypothalamus, you know, and if it's, when push comes to shove, man, the hypothalamus that thing wins. And so, you know, you get people now and then who have a hypothalamic dysfunction and one of them produces a condition called, I can't remember it. It's not dip. So mania, although it's, it's like that doesn't matter. It produces an uncontrollable thirst. And so what will happen is that people who have this hypothalamic problem will drown themselves by drinking water, which, which you can do by the way. Uh, and so they just cannot get enough water and there's no stopping them, right? No, no more than there would be stopping you if you were suffering from raging thirst. It's like it's a happy day when the hypothalamus is not telling you what to do.

Speaker 1:          01:52          And you know, you live in such a civilized state that most of the time, roughly speaking, you're tranquil and satisfied and more or less you can imagine yourself as a peaceful, you know, productive well meaning entity. But don't be thinking that that's what you'd be if you were putting the right situation because that's just not right at all. So, you know, lots of times soldiers developed post traumatic stress disorder because they go out of the battlefield, they're kind of naive. They're young guys, you know, and, and, and, uh, it actually is worse if they're not that bright. It turns out because having a lower Iq is one of the things that predisposes you to post traumatic stress disorder. But anyways, they go out in the battlefield and they see what they're capable of under battlefield conditions. And like, you know, we, we had been fighting wars for a very long time, millions of years.

Speaker 1:          02:45          You know, chimps basically have wars with other chimps, the troops, right? Because the juveniles will patrol the perimeter perimeter of their territory and if they find other chimps from other troops that they outnumber, they will tear them to pieces like in chimps are really, really strong. And so when I say they'll tear them to pieces, I mean that literally, you know, they, they tear them to pieces. And Jane Goodall discovered that originally in 19 seventies and she didn't even report it for awhile because she was so shocked, you know, she kind of assumed like most followers of Ruth's soul, that the human proclivity for warfare was part. That part. That was something that was a uniquely human, you know, it had something to do with our, our unique self consciousness or intelligence or something like that. She had no idea that it was rooted that deeply, you know, we, we split from chimps about six, 7 million years ago, something like that.

Speaker 1:          03:39          And so we were patrolling and territory. We were gang members 7 million years ago. And you know, at that that's, that's minimum estimation because of course that ancestor shaded back maybe $20 million years into entities that were roughly primate like and so territoriality and the. And the proclivity to defend territory is so deeply embedded in us. It's, it's, it's like, it's, it's like it's the, the control center for our whole brain. And so there isn't anything more important to us, I would say. Then maintaining the match between what we want to have happen and what other people are doing in response to our actions. Like that's that that's what we want and as long as that matches maintained, then our emotional systems and I would say anxiety is probably primary in that regard. Our emotional systems remain inhibited. They're on, they're ready like, like a nuclear reactor.

Speaker 1:          04:49          Rods are on and the rest of the brain dampens them down. But it's like if you don't want them to take time to start up, man, you want them to be on at a, at a 10th of a second's notice when it's necessary. And so you know, that's kind of why. Well, if you look at a wild animal, it's like it's alert, you know, it's ready to dark this way or that way, especially a prey animal instantaneously and it has reflex is built into it as you do that will respond way before your conscious. So for example, if you happen to be walking down a trail and you detect something snake like in the periphery, you'll leap away before you even know that you lapped. And that's because it takes a fair bit of time to actually see a snake, by which I mean form a conscious representation of the snake, you know, maybe it takes a quarter of a second or something like that, or even longer, but doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Maybe it takes 10. No 20th of a set a 10th of a second. But the thing about the damn snake is it's way faster than that. It's really fast. That thing, and it coevolved with primates by the way. And so it can nail you like way faster than you can look at it. So you have your eyes map, snake like objects, right onto your reflexes so that the eyes go, the eyes make you jump, and then they see after that's like, yeah, well now you can see that's no problem, you know, so. All right, all. Alright now what I would say that what we do is we live in a shared story and the story is a way of looking at the world and its way of acting in the world at the same time. And that story has to operate within narrow parameters. And this is something that's extraordinarily important to understand because this is something I think that piaget figured out, John Piaget figured out better than anyone else.

Speaker 1:          06:40          I think he really got this right. And by the way, one of the things that piaget was trying to do, you never hear about how strange these great thinkers are. But Piaget was a very strange guy and he was a. He was a hyper genius. He was offered the curatorship of a bloody museum when he was 10 years old, you know, because he wrote this little paper on mollusks, which parent was very good. And so they offered him the curatorship of a museum and his parents wrote back and said, well, you know, no, probably not because he said he's actually tad. And so that was piaget man, the guy who was a genius and you know, he, he was actually motivated by the desire to reconcile science and religion. That was, that was actually his entire motivation for what he did. You'd never hear that.

Speaker 1:          07:22          But that's, that's the case. And so piaget was very interested in how you produce structures that enable you to regulate yourself. Because you're like a kind of a, a colony of strange sub animals that have to figure out how to get along so that you can sort of be one thing. You kind of learned that I would say between the ages of two and four as you're being socialized, you know, how erratic two year olds are. I mean, they're a blast and it's partly because they were erratic. It's like they're unbelievably happy and then they're unbelievably hungry and then they're really hot and then they're really upset and crying, you know? And then they're really scared. It's like an, all of that is just untrammeled and so it's really fun to be around them, especially when they're happy because they're so happy that it's just, you know, you don't ever get to be that happy and so it's nice to be around the two year old because you can kinda feel that again, you know, and a lot of what the.

Speaker 1:          08:15          One of the horrible things about being a parent is that you spend a tremendous amount of your time making your child less happy. And the reason for that is that positive emotion is a very impulsive, you know, and you know because everybody says, well, you should be happy. It's like, well no, when you're happy you're actually quite stupid. And so because happiness makes you impulsive, happiness makes happiness, says hey, things are really good right now. Get what you can while the getting's good. And so as a like, if you're hyper optimistic, manic will say it's like every stock investment looks like a really good stock investment. It's like you won't spend all your money because look at, there's those wonderful things everywhere and you could do such great things with them. And then you know, you spend all your money and then you crash and you think, Oh God, my life's over, you know, because I just, I just spent all my money on all this useless stuff.

Speaker 1:          09:08          And it's all under the grip of impulsive, positive emotion, you know? And so when, when you're telling your kids to be quiet and settled down, it isn't because they're making a lot of noise. Being in pain is because they're running around like wild baboons having a blast and disrupting things like mad, you know, you got kids, you got to settle down, you know, like quit having so much fun and it's, it's kind of awful that you do that, but, but you do. And that's because the emotions and the motivations have to be brought into like a relationship with one another within the person. So that, you know, one thing I remember with my son who is quite, he's quite disagreeable by temperament, which is actually a good thing as far as I'm concerned, although it brings its own challenges. And so with my daughter when she was misbehaving, she was pretty agreeable and uh, you know, if she was misbehaving I can basically just look at her and then she'd quit, you know, but my son, it was like, that was just nothing. You're looking at me. It's like, no, that's just not going to go anywhere, man.
