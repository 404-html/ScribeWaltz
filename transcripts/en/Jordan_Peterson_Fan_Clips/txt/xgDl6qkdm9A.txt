Speaker 1:          00:00          Chimps are brutal creatures, man, like they go to war a and so if you have a chimp territory out in the jungle, then the the juveniles will, the males in particular, the band together in groups of four or five. There's often but not always a female or two with them, and if they come across chimps from another troupe that aren't within their hierarchy, let's say they will, if they're, if they outnumber them because they can't really count, but they can estimate magnitude visually. It's not the same as counting, but if they outnumber them, they will tear them to pieces and chimps or at least twice as strong as a really well developed human male. And so they can tear you up pretty good. And chimps are perfectly capable. They hunt, they're carnivorous like human beings and they hunt, they hunt, call a monkeys often they weigh about 40 pounds and they'll basically eat them alive.

Speaker 1:          00:51          A monkey screaming away like mad because you know, it's in pain because it's being eaten. And um, that doesn't slow the chimps down a bit. There's no cross species empathy stopping them from having their snack. And so, chimps are very brutal creatures and uh, it isn't obvious they have a lot of internal inhibition of their aggression at all. Most of the inhibition is sociological, it's out in the hierarchy. And so the reason chimps aren't always aggressive with one another is because they know who can pound them and, and who will gang up on them and who won't be established their hierarchy anyways. You know, you think about a champ hierarchy and you're talking about a fairly strong and aggressive creature. You might think it's biggest, ugliest, meanest, most vicious, irritable, unpleasant chimp that rises to the top. We're all, that's kind of the postmodernist view of human society.

Speaker 1:          01:43          But that's not the case. It happens sometimes. But what happens in dwell has documented this quite nicely, is that tyron chimps lead unstable regimes. Now, you know, that might sound familiar because the same thing of course is true human beings. And why is that? Well, it's because you know, people don't like tyrants and chimps don't like them that much either. And chimps are actually quite reciprocal in their social interactions. So they don't just dominate each other, they groom each other, they have friendships, they can track social relationships over very long periods of time now and they do that and so they engage in reciprocal interactions, let's say prosocial reciprocal interactions and you might think, well what's the, what's the weak point of the biggest, ugliest, toughest chimp in the troop? And that is he doesn't have any friends. And so, you know, maybe as a bad day is a little hung over or whatever for eating fermented bananas or whatever he is partying with and to have the slightly less ugly, less slightly less mean. Chimps decide, well this is a good time to take them out and they tear him to pieces. And so one of the things to Wallace pointed out quite nicely is that if you want to have a stable chimp dominance hierarchy, let's call it a regime, the stable ones aren't ruled by the tyrants because tyrants get taken out by, by paired up friendship dyads, something like that. So that's really worth thinking about too, you know, because

Speaker 1:          03:16          because it indicates that even in creatures that have less complex sociological orders and they do because one of the things that predicts how complex your social order is, how big your brain is compared to your body, it's encephalization essentially, and the more encephalitis to creature, the larger the social groups that contract. And of course human beings are very highly encephalitis. So we have quite complicated group, um, we have quite complicated group organizations, but even in simpler group organizations like the chimps, it isn't the tyrant who rule stable and that turns out to be also incredibly important. Okay. So, so, so much for the idea that power is the only game in town. Then you got to ask. The question is, well, this is actually a postmodern question. So you know, one of the things Dennis said that the main postmodern joker is that by categorizing you, you, you privilege one concept and you pray, you force other concepts out to the margins.

Speaker 1:          04:17          And so he believed that when you construct it a hierarchy of power, that the hierarchy of power, privilege certain people and marginalized others, and you know that's really not that brilliant and observation as far as I'm concerned, it's rather commonplace. All it means is that when you categorize something that there are things that are in the category and a bunch of things that aren't and so you actually can't categorize anything, which meant means you can't perceive anything, which means you can't think or live without making some things in the middle and everything else on the outside, it's. It's part of categorization itself. And so maybe the postmodernist would go far enough to question the utility of categorization itself. And I think to some degree they do do that. But I'm the point here is that if you.

Speaker 1:          05:12          You have to ask why it is that you would, if you were a postmodernist yourself, why it is that you would privilege the idea of power above all else. So exactly what is it that you're pushing to the margin. And so that's something that we're going to talk about. Now, here's one thing you might push to the margin. Let's say that you believe that hierarchies are a consequence of power. Well then you push competence to the margin and then applying the postmodern modernist logic. You might say, well, the reason you're privileging power is so that you can produce so that you could push competence to the margin, and so you want to keep that in mind too, because that's going to become important as we discussed the relationship between postmodernism and Marxism. Maybe you're after the destruction of the idea competence itself.

Speaker 2:          06:00          All right, so

Speaker 1:          06:02          froggy postmoderns and we talked about it a little bit. We'll return to it. Now we're going to talk a little bit about Marxism. I've got a quote here from mark's. The proletarians have nothing to lose, but our chains. Well, I was pretty good for like 1880 or 1890 or whenever it was he wrote at somewhere around that period of time it turned out the proletarians had a lot more to lose than their chains. They had their lives and their families to lose. That was demonstrated and play as a consequence of the. What would you call it, the sociological movements that were put into place when the Marxist presuppositions began to govern societies like the Soviet Union. So, all right, so let's take the same postmodernist approach. So here's some basic tenants of Marxism. It's Berge Lousy against proletariat. The bridge was the year, the capitalists, the property owners, those sorts of people, the proletariat, the working class, for all intents and purposes. The basic idea is that history itself is nothing but the, what would you call it, the documentation of the struggle of one class against the other.

Speaker 2:          07:11          Um,

Speaker 1:          07:12          okay. Um, no, like, that's wrong, but it's okay because it's too simple. Obviously. It's obviously too simple. There's all sorts of motivations that people have. Some of them are economic, some of them are associated with power.

Speaker 2:          07:27          Um,

Speaker 1:          07:28          but that's okay. We will leave that. Let's, let's give the devil his due and say, well, yeah, fair enough. There's still a fair bit of tension between the haves and the haves and have nots. And maybe that was even more intense in previous societies than it is now. And it's no, there's no doubt that economics plays a role in, in virtually everything that human beings do in a fairly significant role. So let, let's, let's accept that as a

Speaker 2:          07:49          potential theory. It's, it's simple, but maybe it's

Speaker 1:          07:52          practically useful. And then there's kind of an offshoot of that theory, which is that, well, if you're a Marxist, that means you have sympathy for the working class, right? Because that's what you're saying all the time. It's like, well, the poor working class, they're all oppressed. The poor, poor proletariat, you know? And, and then you're also saying, well we're the good guys because we're standing on the side of the oppressed. And so then you might also ask what you're marginalizing when you claim that you're the good guys because one of the things that you would be marginalizing is all of the ways in which you're not the good guys, but we can leave that aside for a moment too. So, but there's the claims is that, you know, there's the working class against the ruling class. Another claim is the ruling class is the ruined class because they exploited the working class, basically stealing their excess labor from them.

Speaker 1:          08:38          Um, another very, very, you're a what, a surfacely attractive claim that lacks any reasonable justification because it's predicated on the idea of the world as a zero sum game. And clearly the world is not a zero sum game. So when someone creates wealth, when someone is wealthy, it can be at least at times because they created it, not because they swiped it from someone else. I think, you know, you can think of someone like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs is a good example of that. Um, you know, they're, they're what they produced had a value that far exceeded what they garnered as a consequence of their production even though what they garnered was fairly substantial. So anyways, but we'll get, like you said, we're going to give the devil his due. Okay. It's the bourgeoisie against the proletariat will accept that. It's class warfare is the primary historical mover.

Speaker 1:          09:33          No problem. Now, but here's what I'm not willing to give away so easily. Uh, we have sympathy for the working class primarily and we're good because of that. No, I'm not gonna like, give that away. So simply. So let's investigate that a little bit. Let's see if we can actually figure it out. If that's true, we'll say a use a pragmatic approach because I'm a pragmatist in that William James, Sansa, uh, or maybe you can think about it even more deeply in anciently. Uh, there's a statement in the New Testament, I think it's by their fruits, you shall know the fine. So we're going to walk down that road, um, before we do that. So now that's another thing you have to keep in mind. Before we do that, I want to make one more detour. Okay. So I like making detours and then tangling all back together.
