Speaker 1:          00:00          One idea that's very common in our culture is that poverty is caused by lack of money and that's a really stupid idea because money is very difficult to handle. I had clients who were drug addicts and the worst possible thing that could happen to them was that they got some money. They're just done. First of all, you know, they were hanging around with people who were little on the sociopathic side and so especially if they weren't that bright and couldn't defend themselves very well, as soon as they got money while it was off to the bar with all the friends and you know, one guy I remember in particular, you know, every time he got as his disability check, he was gone for five days, usually fundament a ditch, you know, because you just go to the bar, spent every Saturday had on alcohol and cocaine and wake up in a ditch.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Three quarters dead, uh, eventually completely dead. And No. Then he was ashamed and horrified and repentant and he'd straightened himself out again. And then that was all well and good until, as long as he was broke until the next check showed up and then bang the same thing. So you know, it's not like money is necessarily a good for everyone. It's hard manage money. It's really easy for it to disappear. I mean elderly people have a hell of a time now because you know, crooks are contacting them on the Internet nonstop. And so just giving people money, money's like, it's like pouring water in their hands. It's not that helpful. Not necessarily that helpful. And then of course contributors to poverty are well, it's not so good to have a low Iq. You know, people don't like the idea of Iq because it seems so arbitrary, you know, have a high Iq.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Well it's not like you deserved it. Exactly. It's your setup that way pretty much right from the beginning. It's a very, very, very, very stable. You can make a high Iq person stupider by not educating them up to the level of their possibility, but taking someone who has a low Iq and trying to raise that. It's like if you can figure out how to do that, well you know it's Nobel prize time for you because people have tried that a lot and most recently with those, you know, Luminol lumosity games and that sort of thing and the evidence that those produce anything other than brilliant performances on the lumosity game itself is basically zero. We haven't been able to figure out how to see cause I intelligence is a cross domain phenomena and you can get really good in a single domain by practicing like Matt and what you'd want is to practice like matt in a single domain and hope that it generalizes to other domains. That's the holy grail of intelligence and creeks. It's like, no, no one's done it. People claim it, but the claims never hold up and people have been trying for a long time to do it and they haven't been able to do it. And

Speaker 1:          03:07          differences in Iq really make a difference. You know, I mean you guys, average Iq is probably one slash 25 slash 30 ad at 1:15. You're at the 85th percentile and 1:15 would barely get you going for you. For Harvard University, 1:30, you're probably graduate school material 1:45. You're up there at the range where you can probably do pretty much whatever you want. Although as you get smarter, the scatter between your abilities increase. So you might have a very high verbal Iq but not be so good at mathematics or the other way around. But it's a massive contributor to lifetime success and I don't know what to do about that. I mean why do smart people make more money? Well, they get to where the edge of production is faster. So if you have a thousand people and you rank order them by ICU, the smart people are going to come up with new ideas first and they're going to have more ideas and they're going to strategize better. And you know, with an Iq of 90, which is 15 percent of the population, you think about that 15 percent of the population. That's pretty much the threshold for reading instructions and being able to follow them.

Speaker 1:          04:35          So you know, and our society is increasingly sophisticated, so it's by no means obvious, you know, the Liberals think well society is unfair because there's unemployment and the Conservatives think while there's a job for everyone and, but none of them think, well, there are massive, massive, massive differences in people's ability far greater than anyone realizes. And that poses a structural problem. I had a client and I got him a volunteer job, which is way harder than you think. You need a police check, for example, like it's harder to get a volunteer job than a real job. But I regard them in a volunteer job and he had to fold pieces of paper letters was he worked at a charity. He had to follow up pieces of paper in three so that he could put them inside envelopes and,

Speaker 1:          05:28          and then the letters which were in a pile had to be matched with the proper envelopes, which we're also in a pile, but some of them were French and some of the wrangling. So the French ones had to be matched carefully to the French envelopes. And then if, you know, if there was one envelope out of, out of order, well then he had to figure out whether it was the papers that were out of order or the letters that were out of order. And then some of the letters had photographs attached them and you weren't supposed to bend the photographs and, but they weren't always in the same place. So that meant you had to figure out how to fold the paper in three a bunch of different ways without creasing the photograph. And then the other thing is, and I never realized how difficult it is to put a piece of paper in an envelope until I watched someone who couldn't do it and he probably had an Iq of about 80, you know, if you met him on the street, you wouldn't think anything different of him.

Speaker 1:          06:26          He was normal looking guy had some other problems. Um, I trained him to fold those damn papers for like 30 hours and he got reasonably good at it. But you know, if you're good at it and you probably all are, you fold it and the edges line up exactly like really, exactly. The tolerance is probably half a millimeter or something like that. Then you do the second fold and the tolerance is the same. But let's imagine that the first full you, you're out by an eighth of an inch in the second full year out by an eighth of an inch. So it's a little crooked. Not means in totally route by a quarter of an inch. Then it won't fit in the damn envelope. So then you kind of crumpled envelope when you put it in there and then it gets stuck in the sorting machine. And so he sweated blood trying to do that job and eventually big eventually plan to fire him.

Speaker 1:          07:23          So imagine what that's like, hey, you know you can't get a job. And then so you get a job at a charity as a volunteer and a charity decides to fire you. You know? I mean really that's just. So I talked to the woman who was running it and suggested that that might be a little on the devastating side. I mean, she had her reasons, you know, he, he, he was always asking people questions about how to do his job and you know, so that meant he was interfering with the productivity of other people and it was genuine interference. I mean, she wasn't being mean and it was her job to make sure the place did what it was supposed to. So, you know, she was between a rock and a hard place. Um, he eventually decided that the job wasn't for him and relatively soon after that I think it was too stressful and uh, he quit.

Speaker 1:          08:25          So that solved that problem except then you didn't have job, which of course is a problem. Um, it has a happy ending. This story, as far as I know, he, he got a dog because he was very lonesome. And that dog man, having that guy trained, that dog, that was something else, that dog just think he lost 30 pounds while he was training that dog because dogs, they're, you know, dominant. And he had to have a tussle with the dog to figure out who was in charge and it's a lot of responsibility to have a dog, but he was pretty damn committed to that dog. And he managed it. The things he went through to keep that dog. You just cannot possibly imagine. It's like a, it's like a, it's like a surreal. It was surreal. Just like the nuclear missile silo. I mean, he had people following him around informing on him because they thought he was abusing the dog when in fact, because I watched the dog was clearly abusive.

Speaker 1:          09:20          Um, so he got a job helping a woman who trained dogs and, and then he had a job. So Hooray, you know, but it was like a miracle fundamentally. So anyways, the reason I'm telling you all this is because there was a reason for the Cold War and the reason was that there is inequality and there's different theories about how to address that inequality and different theories about why it exists. And there was a Marxist theory about why it exists, which was roughly something like property equals theft. And those who have more have taken it from those who have less, which seems to me to eliminate any conceptual lization that there isn't a fixed pot of money, you know, money expands actually as we become more technologically proficient. And lots of people who have money have it because they've generated a lot of wealth. I mean, Bill Gates is a great example of that, right? He popularized computing, he made it possible for everybody to have access to computing. It's like, seems like a good good for him. You know. And you could say the same thing about Steve jobs and maybe you'll be able to say the same thing about Elon Musk and you know, these guys have tremendous resources at their disposal, but you know, they're not like, they're not bathing in bank notes. You know, they're, you're trying to continue to do things and they use their money to do things. And.
