Speaker 1:          00:00          People ask what the meaning of life is and it seems to me that meaning is proportionate to the adoption of responsibility. You know, like let's say you have a little sister who's like three,

Speaker 1:          00:19          you're going to take care of her. Like questioning whether that's a good idea just seemed stupid. You know what I mean? It just doesn't seem like the right kind of question. It's like, well obviously self evidently let's say that's what you do and you find it meaningful. It's like probably, you know, interacting with a little kid when we had, when I had little kids, you know, when they were like two or under, we took them out to see their relatives and they were older people and you know, they watched that two year old like, like it was a fire, you know, every second that that little kid was in the room, every single adult was focused on, focused on, on him or her.

Speaker 2:          01:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08          That's something that people attended to and that's a source of meaning. And what else is a meaningful? Well, your family relationships are meaningful to you and maybe the responsibility that you adopt as, as a friend that, that seems meaningful. Maybe your decision to pursue a particular career and be of some utility in society, you know, part of that's governed by your desire to establish some security and get ahead. It's fine, but you're also playing an integral role in the maintenance of the structure that supports you. And my observation has been that in my clinical practice is that people just have a hell of a time if they don't have, if they don't slot in somewhere, you know, you know, you think I got to go to work at nine in the morning and you know, I've got this rigid schedule. It's like

Speaker 1:          02:00          it's probably a good idea to be grateful for that because of. What I have noticed is that if people pull out from those externally scaffolded systems, they drift, they get depressed, they get anxious, they don't know what to do with themselves. You know, they're kinda like sled dogs with no slab and we're kinda like sled dogs as far as I can tell. Beasts of burden. Like we need a load, man, we need a load, and the question is what, what sort of low do you need? And here's why I think we need, we need that. You know, there's, I've been thinking about how to figure out what's real for a long time and because I'm an existentialist, I'm operating under the presupposition that you can tell what people believe by watching what they, how they act. I don't care what they say, I don't care what their statements are about their view of reality because the correlation, the relationship between that and their actual actions is not certainly not perfect and sometimes it doesn't even exist. One thing I've noticed is that people, no one argues with their own pain. Everyone who hurts acts as if they believe that pain is real.

Speaker 1:          03:25          So we could say the ultimate reality is pain. That's how people act. It's in keeping with the claims of many religious traditions. You know, the Jews are always recollecting past pain. I mean the Christian God is crucified person. I mean there's a fair bit of pain there for the Buddhists. The fundamental maximum is that life is suffering. And I'm, it seems to me that there's a metaphysical claim there no metaphysical claim is that pain is real. Now, of course it depends on what you mean by real, but people act as if their pain is real. So that's a good place to start. Now that poses a problem.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Life is a pain, life is suffering, let's say. And why is that? Well, it's because you can be broken, hurt and destroyed. And so that seems pretty self evident and worse, you know it. And that makes people unique. Like that's our selfconsciousness, right? That's really what separates us in some sense from other creatures. I mean other creatures have some self consciousness like a chimp can learn to recognize itself and a mirror and soaking a dolphin. But you know, that's pretty, that's pretty bare bones, selfconsciousness, you know, real self consciousness is the knowledge of your borders and not only in space but in time. And as far as I can tell, human beings are the only creatures that have discovered the future. And that's really good because we can plan for the future, but it's really bad because you know the future is finite and that's like that's a big shock to the old system and it's the existential burden that everyone bears and its associated integrity with suffering. And so then you think, well, life is suffering and it's finite and that's part of the suffering. That's part of what you makes you question the value of existing and maybe the value of existence itself.

Speaker 1:          05:46          So then what do you have to, were used as a weapon against that? Well, you know, we talked a little bit about responsibility. Now it seems to work, you know, the, the amount of responsibility that you adopt

Speaker 1:          06:03          with really in relationship to things seems to increase your meaningful engagement. And you might say, well what's the most meaningfully engaged activity? And you might say, well how about little reduction in the old suffering? No. So you live your life so that you're not causing undue pain, especially pointless pain. That would be good. And maybe you could even be more useful than that. And you could figure out some ways that some suffering years, other people's both, if you're really hitting a home run, maybe you can figure out some way that some of that can be rectified and that seems to be meaningful in and of itself. I mean, if it's pain that makes you doubt the meaning of life, which is perfectly reasonable, then the cessation of pain, the cessation of suffering, the minimization of suffering as a logical corollary should be the proper medication. And so I would say that means that there's some mode that you can conduct yourself in that makes you a good person

Speaker 2:          07:19          and

Speaker 1:          07:20          part of being a good person is to alleviate suffering.

Speaker 2:          07:26          And

Speaker 1:          07:29          I don't think you get to question that actually. If, if the suffering itself is what's making you question the validity of your life, then you can't also say that the cessation of that is not useful. I mean you can, but it's completely incoherent. You can. You can claim incoherent things if you want. So then I would say these distilled stories that I'm talking about, the stories that are written by great authors, I'm particularly fond of Dostoevsky whose, whose works are he's head and shoulders above anyone I've ever read in terms of

Speaker 1:          08:17          writers of fiction. He deals with the hardest questions that human beings face and he, he has characters on both sides of the argument and there they really lay out the arguments. It's not like Dostoevsky and all. He has got a belief and so he has a character and that character has his beliefs. And that character always wins the arguments. It's that doesn't happen. And the Dostoyevsky novel at all, he sets up a character and then he sets up like three or four antagonists and those antagonists, they're not straw men, they're like iron giants. They just stomp his, his protagonist, you know. And the whole thing is a war between these different conceptions of being. It's amazing to see. It's amazing to read.

Speaker 2:          09:01          Um,

Speaker 1:          09:07          so you distill these stories, great authors distill stories, great storytellers distill stories, and we have stories that are very, very, very, very old. Those are usually religious stories. Of one form or another particular be fairy tales because fairy tales, some people have traced fairytales back, you know, more than 10,000 years and so they're part of an oral tradition and oral traditions can last for tens of thousands of years and you know, it's a story that's been told for 10,000 years is a funny kind of story. It's like people have remembered it and, and obviously modified it. It's like the game of telephone, you know, where I tell you something and you whispered to the person next to you and so on. It's like a game of telephone that's gone on for you know, thousand generations and all that's left is what people remember and maybe they remember what's important because you tend to remember what's important and didn't necessarily the case that you know, what the hell it means. You don't know what music means, but you know that's a stop you from listening to it. You don't know. Generally speaking, what a movie that you see or a book that you read means not. If it's profound, it means more than you can understand because otherwise why read it.
