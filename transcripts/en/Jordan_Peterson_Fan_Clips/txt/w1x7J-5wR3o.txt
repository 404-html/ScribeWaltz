Speaker 1:          00:00          I was having a discussion with Sam Harris the other day, which was very, um, what would you say? He said we got wrapped around an axle, which is pretty much hate. Sam Harris is one of the four famous atheists along with Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennett. Yeah. And so we were having a discussion and um, he's a determinist just right down to the bottom. It's like you're determined, you're determined. There's no freewill. You're a deterministic machine. And you know, if you're a coherent scientist and you're a Newtonian, roughly speaking, you don't really have much choice other than to think that way, but that isn't how it seems to people and we don't treat each other that way. And our entire legal system is predicated on the idea that you do in fact have freewill. So. Well, can we account for it? Well, no. And do we have a scientific model for it?

Speaker 1:          00:53          No, but then I would also say we do not have a scientific model for consciousness. We don't know a damn thing about consciousness, which is why Dan Dennett book, which was called consciousness explained, was referred to. It's by it's critics as consciousness explained a way, which is exactly right as far as I'm concerned because he took a mechanistic approach and I just don't think you get to do that because there's something really weird about consciousness. I mean, th, the phenomenologists Heidegger, who tried to radically transform western philosophy right from the bottom up, he basically said, well, you know, you can treat the world as if consciousness is primary and that human experience is reality. That's reality and that he doesn't exist independently of consciousness in any explicable way. It's like, well, what's out there? If there's nothing to to experience it? Well, everything at once. It's something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:47          It's, it's not really comprehensible as without a subject that subject defines it. It makes it real. Now you don't have to believe that, but, but at least I'm telling you that there are thoroughly coherent philosophical positions that make that case very strongly and that that allow consciousness to exist as a phenomena and to take it seriously and you certainly act like you take it seriously. You Act like there's a you and that you make choices and you certainly treat other people that way. Deterministic or not, you're still going to get angry when they're being rude to you and you're going to act as if they had some choice in the matter. Now maybe that's an illusion possibly, but maybe it's not. And I would say the oldest stories that we have always include that as not only as a fundamental element, but even as the fundamental element so.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Well, so you can think about that however you want. But anyways, so Japan comes along and he's going to finish off the puppet. And so what does he do to finish off the puppet? He gives it a. it's, it gives it a voice. It gives it a mouth. Well, that's really, really interesting. So in Genesis, in Genesis, this is a, this is a very, very complex idea and it took people thousands of years to figure this idea out and it's something like this is so at the beginning of everything, there was chaos and that was like potential. It was something like potential, the potential for being and God who is God? The father in the genesis account uses a faculty that he has, which is the word to call being from chaos knots, the creation of Ba, right? It's the. It's the manifestation of order from chaos and it's the word, the logos that it's.

Speaker 1:          03:36          It's the logos. That's the tool that God uses to do that and that logos in Christianity is associated with Christ, which is a very weird thing, but the reason for that is that there's an idea that the divine element of the individual is the thing that uses language, communicative language to call the world into being, and that is what we do as far as we can tell. It's like you make a decision. You think it through, you talk it over with your friends, you plot a course and the world manifests itself in relationship to your choice and it's for that reason and it is for that reason that in genesis and in many other accounts that that logo's capacity is identified with human beings. It's like you have a small bit of that in you. Whatever that means, and you participate in the process of continually generating order out of chaos and and sometimes the reverse, you mediate between them and so and that is that in our, in, in, in, in Western culture and certainly the case at other cultures as well, that that's why you have rights.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Fundamentally. That's why the law has to respect you is because you've got this spark of divinity in you that's transcendent that nobody gets to transgress against and you say, well, do you believe that? It's like, well, you act like you believe it. You treat other people like you believe it or they're not very happy with you. So it depends on what you mean by believe you acted out well. Do you accept it as a proposition? Oh, I don't care if you accept that as a proposition, frankly, because I think the best indicator of what you believe is how you act. Not what you say because what do you know about what you know? Hardly anything and so actions speak louder than words and if you want to be treated properly by someone, what that means is that you want to treat them, you want them to treat you as a valuable autonomous entity.

Speaker 1:          05:31          That's what you want. And so maybe you're not that. Maybe you're a deterministic puppet and what this strange movie suggests is that you are kind of a deterministic puppet, but that you don't have to be all right, well you, the mouth goes on and then Japan was happy about that and then they have a little dance, you know, they, they turn the music on and all these little music boxes and they all play together and it's like harmony of some sort has been established because that's what the music represents and the, there's layers of reality that are communicating with one another because that's what the music represents. And then they have a little dance and the idea is that, well, it's a good thing to let this puppet habits own voice. Well, that's an interesting idea because what the hell does it? No, it's a wooden headed marionette.

Speaker 1:          06:19          Why the hell would you want something like that to talk? Well, it's the same question you have in relationship to your children. It's like what do they know? They're two or three, you know, they don't know anything. Well, so should you just like tyrannized them and make them do everything you want? Are you going to let them have a bit of a voice? And the question is, it depends on whether do we want them to be a puppet or not. And if you don't want them to be a puppet, if you want them to grow up autonomous, then you let them have a voice and you facilitate the development of that voice and so and, and, and that's. And that's what you do if you don't want a marionette. So, and Japan who doesn't want a marionette. So he gives the puppet of voice even though he knows it's just a puppet and that it's, it doesn't know anything.

Speaker 1:          07:04          And then this is fantastic. So the cricket sitting up there watching that, he's pretty happy with it. That's the first little seed and you see there and he's sitting by this other thing that is just not happy at all and if that's the terrible father and you see it's a character that repeats throughout the entire movie. You see manifestations of the tyrannical father continually through the movie in different characters. Like he's played out by different roles. And so first of all, the cricket is so thrilled about this. And then he looks at the frowning king there who's, who is not happy that the puppet has been given a voice. He's a tyrant, right? He's the representation of a tyrant and a tyrant does not want you to have a voice. And so the cricket looks at him and says, well, you can't please everybody all the time.

Speaker 1:          07:47          And it's just this tiny little fragment of a joke, you know. But it's, there's this old idea. I think it comes from Chekhov and, and the idea is that if you set a playoff and there's a gun, a rifle or a pistol on a table in the first act, it better have been used by the third act. Or it shouldn't have been there at all and the idea is you don't put anything in your play that it's random. You never do that. It's like, because this isn't life, that, that this isn't life. This is a work of art and everything is connected and it's caught know it's there by intent. And so this isn't accidental that this little king character doesn't like what's going on or that he shows up. So anyways, all, all the clocks go off and the music boxes go and they have a little dance and everybody's happy about it.

Speaker 1:          08:37          And, and then Japan notices what time it is. And so there's a tremendous emphasis on time in this part of the movie because there are all these clocks are going off and they're all telling him what time it is. Like 30 clocks go off and then he takes his watch out and notices what time it is. It's like the idea that there's something about going on is like whack that you, you know, dozens of times so that you get it. And it's a little joke that he pulls out his watch and he figures out it's time for bed. Well, so now we're making a transition between the conscious world and the unconscious world. Okay. So, so there's an intimation in the movie that everything that happens now is in the unconscious world. And the way you know that is that it's, it's strange because the movie moves in and out of this underworld.

Speaker 1:          09:25          But at the very end, when Pinocchio's transformed into a real boy, the last thing Japan does is I think it's Japan always hit one of the pendulums and start all the clocks again. So it says, if what happens from here onwards is part of a dream, now it's, it's murky because Pinocchio goes to school and you know, there's the next day and all of that. But. And so those are sort of realistic elements. But then there's also the whole going down into the ocean to find the whale thing, which seems completely dreamlike and, but there's an intimation that we're in a different kind of world. And, and so we go to, they all go to sleep, including the cricket. And so then Japan, oh, notices the star and because he's a good guy, he makes a wish on the start and we've already explained why you might wish on a star and what that might mean.

Speaker 1:          10:14          And He makes it very interesting wish. Um, it's, it's not a self serving wish. In fact, it's quite the contrary. He doesn't wish that Pinocchio is an obedient son. He doesn't wish that he's produced someone who will work for him. He doesn't wish any of that. He wishes what a good father would wish, which is that the creation that he's brought forth would develop its capacity for autonomy. He wants them to become real. He wants him to become an actual living creature and not a wooden headed marionette. And so you'd say, well, that is what your father should wish for you. You know, and I have clients frequently whose fathers weren't like that at all. They were to radical or they were neglectful or, or they punish this person every time they did something good. That's a real fun game. They competed with them and undermining them at every opportunity. They didn't want to produce someone strong. And autonomous, they wanted to give birth to a slave and then diminish it as much as possible. And so that's bad. It's not good and not so Japan was not like that. So he says, well, I'm going to wish for something completely unreasonable, which is that part of that ideal idea, right? And they're unreasonable thing is that this puppet could become

Speaker 1:          11:35          real, could actually take on its autonomy and, and move forward. And so that's what he wishes. And then they go to sleep

Speaker 1:          11:47          and then the cricket starts to become driven mad by the noises of the clock. And so it's like he's going into the sort of, of hyper alertness and the clocks are clanging. Adam and Jupiter was snoring and, and that he can even hear the little grains of sand falling out of the, out of the our glass. He's becoming hyper alert, hyper alert, and then he yelled, stop. And all the clock stop. Which is pretty good trick for cricket, you know, it's like he's the master of time. But also we're in a place now where time has come to a stop or outside of time. And one of the things that Freud pointed about, dreams is that dreams are kind of outside of time. Now, here's what that means is first of all, they draw and eternal themes. That's part of it. But you know, he must have had this experience.

Speaker 1:          12:32          And Freud noted this carefully in the interpretation of dreams where you know you're sleeping and the alarm goes off and the alarm noise is incorporated into your dream. And it's like the dream has been going on for an hour in subjective time. And you wake up and you realize that it's the alarm clock. It's like. And there's no reason why your dream time should be the same as real time because it's all going on in your imagination. But it's amazing in some sense how much can happen in such a short period of time in your imagination. And so it's outside of time. The world of fantasy is in some sense out of outside of time. And so the cricket tells time to stop and it does. And then the star enlarges and it turns into this blue fairy who's got a celestial gown covered with stars.

Speaker 1:          13:25          And who's got wings, so she's kind of some ethereal being and like you don't have a problem with that in the movie. It's like, yeah, sure. I mean, you know, it's a ferry. It came from a star. That makes perfect sense, which of course it does. It makes no sense whatsoever. Right? It makes no sense, but you're willing to go along with it because on the one hand it makes sense. No sense. And on the other hand it makes perfect sense. It's like the fairy godmother idea. It's like, yeah, yeah, fairy God, mother, no problem. We, we got that. And it's in the idea there is that while nature comes to your aid, it's something like that. It's, it's, it's the benevolent force of nature is on your side now, not obviously only on your side because it opposes you as well, but then there's your own mother as well who's also nature, who's on your site.

Speaker 1:          14:12          And so, but there's an idea here and the idea is that if the father gets the wish right, the aim right for the child, then nature will cooperate. Right? And that's true. I believe that's true. Is that if you set up your relationship, your cultural relationship with your child properly, then they're far more likely to flourish and so you get the magic of nature on your side by establishing the proper aim. And so that's what happens. Japan. Oh says, well, this is what I'm. This is what I'm aiming at and because he's aiming at at it and because it's within the realm of possibility, nature comes to his service and that is how it works. That's exactly how it works because when you aim at something, then you muster your biological forces towards that goal and if the goal is feasible and attainable, then you will cooperate with yourself.

Speaker 1:          15:10          And so that's quite cool. Carl Rogers would call that. What's the word for that? I think he called a genuineness, which is kind of weak, but. But I think. I think that's still what he called it. He sort of meant that. Well, that's sort of what happens when your, when your goals and your physiological and biological being are aligned well and you're and you can communicate both. You're not full of internal contradictions and so your conscious aims and your biological possibilities are manifesting themselves in the same direction. And so while that would be good, so anyways, the fairy shows up and she's quite sexually attractive. She's quite provocative and she, she charms the cricket and who gets all blushes and like is all, you know, embarrassed and overwhelmed by this like figure of celestial beauty and decides to cooperate. That conscience decides to cooperate and get some responsibility.

Speaker 1:          16:06          And so the ferry allows the puppet to move without strings. So that's kind of interesting. So it's the intervention of nature. Culture focuses the aim and then it's the intervention of nature that produces the autonomy and that seems to be right. I mean, even though it's not that understandable, it seems to be right. And then so she takes the strings off Pinocchio and you might say, well, that's partly because your child is not certainly not just a creature of culture. By no means your child has a temperament. You'll see that right away and that temperament will unfold and hopefully it'll unfold in a cultural context that's amenable to it. And that the combination of those two things will produce something new, he can talk, he can walk, and so the good fairy basically tells him that he's got a bit of autonomy and now it's up to him to like clue in Tibet and act properly and learn the difference between good and evil and to speak truthfully and all that.

Speaker 1:          17:08          It's a bit a propagandistic that part of the movie I would say, but it doesn't really matter. It's kind of inculcation of conventional morality and there's a fair bit to it, especially that he's supposed to tell the truth. And uh, you know, he says he will. And the crickets listening. And then the puppet asks, well, what does conscience mean? Because the ferry says, always let your conscience be your guide. And he says, well, what does consciousness mean? And then the bug who's like all puffed up because he wants to impress the ferry, plops down and gets on his little matchbox and gives this like horrible little lecture about how to behave properly. That's just like ideological chatter. You could hardly even stand listening to it. And it's supposed to be like that. It's generic moral advice that anyone could give that's kind of dull and, and also puffed up and grandiose and he's just not very good at it.

Speaker 1:          18:00          So, and that's why he's on his little matchbox there with his chest puffed out. And so he says that's just the travel with the world today. And uh, and I think that's his opening line, you know, he's diagnosing the whole world and you know, the fairy, she thinks he's kind of funny because he is and you know, it's sort of, there's a real interesting thing here going on because he's male and he's, he's all puffed up with his knowledge, which is completely shallow. And then he's put in contact with this celestial feminine ideal and he just turns into a complete moron. And that's exactly what happens to man. It happens to them all the time. So anyways, she decides to give them a chance and turns them into this conscience and all of a sudden he's this like 19 twenties millionaires. So He's been, he's been ennobled, but then she tells him that, you know, he has to journey along with Pinocchio in order for things to go properly and he promises that he'll be a good conscience and do it and he already thinks that he can do it and that's why he's on the matchbox podium, you know, espousing his morality.

Speaker 1:          19:02          But the reality turns out to be much more complex. So the bug has a little talk with the cricket or the bug has a little talk with the puppet and the Bug tries to tell Pinocchio explicitly what it means to be good and he gets completely tangled up in the explanation because what the hell does he know? And the, the Papa doesn't understand anything that he says anyways. And so there's a message there and the message is the kind of knowledge that the conscience is that the conscience and the puppet are supposed to cocreate is not something that you can articulate easily as a table of rules. It's not like that because life is too complicated to just have fought five rules that you live by and that will solve every problem. Partly because the rules will conflict. That's a huge part of the problem, right?

Speaker 1:          19:52          One moral guideline contradicts another ines situations like you don't know what to do. So anyways, they decided that there they decided that they're just going to. He says, Pinocchio says, well I'll be a good boy, and the cricket says, well that's the spirit, and then, well then Japan, oh, gets wind of it and they have a little like horror episode and then he finds out that the public can is autonomous and they have a little party which tells you exactly what your pedals up to is. The autonomy emerges and he's happy about it. So it's stamping home the notion that Japan is in fact a good guy and that that is in fact what he wants. So it's like the encouragement of your father is a precondition for the emergence of your individuality and, and it also allows the feminine to play a role both as nature and perhaps as mother and so and the combination of those two produces the autonomous individual.

Speaker 1:          20:49          It's like, well, that seems perfectly reasonable. So off they go to sleep, next day they wake up and it's a new day and, and Pinocchio is off to school and that's a good thing too because Japan isn't and he's really excited about it. And so what that means is that he's been parented properly and he's going to go out into the world of his peers, which is where he belongs. And Japan isn't too worried about it. In fact, he is pushing them out the door, you know, it's like go, you can do it, this is the next thing. The kid isn't cowering in the corner and overcome by terror with the parents freaking out about all the things that are going to go wrong. It's, there's some faith in his, his ability. So he sees all the kids wandering by and, and Japan, no dresses them up and sends them off to school and so and so.

Speaker 1:          21:38          That's good. So that's a happy family story. It's like mom and dad got together. They decided that there, the kid was gonna, you know, be competent and autonomous and ready to face the world. And so Audi goals and so he's like five years old at this point or something like that and that's where we get, that's where we're at in the story and I think that's a good place to stop because the next thing that happens is normally essentially it's like Pinocchio goes off to be a good boy, but it turns out that that's a hell of a lot more complicated than he might think because there are actually complications in the world, but also malevolence right? The desire for things not to go right. There are people who are not oriented towards the ideal in any way. Adult and Pinocchio's young and naive and so he has no defense whatsoever against this malevolence and that's, you know, that's not an expect, not unexpected.

Speaker 1:          22:40          And it also turns out that the conscience, the cricket, who is still not very clued in over sleeps. And so he's just not there at a critical moment. But I think we'll pick that up. We'll pick that up next week because this is a good point in the plot to stop the child has entered the broader world and has to cope with it. And so he's prepared because he had a wonderful father and he had a magical mother and so he's as prepared as you can be. He's not even completely a marionette anymore, but, but, but now it's up to him. That's the thing. Now it's up to him and his parents have done basically what they could. And that's really about right. You know, um, it's, it's wise. I would say psychologically. So. Alright, that's, that.
