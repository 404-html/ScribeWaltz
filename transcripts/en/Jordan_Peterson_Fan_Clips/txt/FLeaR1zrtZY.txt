Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the things that the Auschwitz guards used to do to the prisoners, and this is very telling, so at Auschwitz there was a sign that said work will make you free. It was a little joke. Not really a very funny joke, you know, it's the kind of joke that you have to be, say tannic is the appropriate term to conceptualize and to dare to

Speaker 1:          00:29          due to state. So when now our sweats prisoners came to Auschwitz, you know, they're already pretty, pretty rough shape. They were in cattle cars. They'd been separated from their families. Everything had been taken from them. They were transported for a long time. They were standing up, the kids were suffocating because there was no room in that, you know, it was so packed in there. They didn't have anything to eat. There weren't any toilet facilities of any sort. It was like you got rid of 20 percent of the people just transporting them, you know the ones on the outside of the cars, they froze to death because of course it was cold and pretty nasty. And then when they got to Auschwitz, the guards used to have this game that they would play. This is part of the work will set you free thing. They would get a prisoner, they take a prisoner who's already in pretty pretty rough shape and then have them carry a sack of wet, sold 100 pounds from one side of the camp to the other. And you know, when you think of a camp, you think of something like a football field, you know, maybe something that big fences around. It's like, no way man, these were cities. These were, there were tens of thousands of people in these places. So from one side of the camp compound to the other, that was a good hike and that wasn't bad enough. They had to get them to carry it back and put it in the same place.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Now that's poetic and it's malevolence. You know, what you're doing is you're harnessing the human compulsion to engage in useful activity and demonstrating how absolutely futile that is despite its difficulty, seems like a bad thing to do. People need. It's a parody of meaninglessness. That's what that is. And you know, people need meaning in their lives because their lives are difficult. And so the question is to what end should you devote your life? And another question might be, well, does it matter? Matter is an interesting word, a because matter is matter, but matter is also what matters. And I would say that what matters is more real than matter. At least that's how you act. And then the question is, well, is there something you should be aiming at? That's a good question. That's the question of the meaning of life. And you know, one of the things that supposed to happen when you come to university is that that's the sort of question that should be addressed. And as far as I can tell, and this might just be my more cynical side, what I see happening to university students generally speaking, is that they come in clinging to the wreckage of their culture and floating with the pieces. And those pieces are taken away by

Speaker 1:          03:36          professors who tell them that everything can be deconstructed and no, nothing has any real meaning. And it's like when you're finally educated, it's when you're floating out on the ocean and you've got nothing to stay afloat with. It's like, well then you're, you're done. And you congratulate. And it's like, I don't see that as useful. Quite the contrary. So let me tell you a story.

Speaker 1:          04:19          The first thing I'm going to propose to you, and we'll talk about this a lot, is that you inhabit a story that the framework through which you look at the world is actually a story. And here's the story. The story is you're somewhere and you're going somewhere and even that can be conceptual or whatever. It's the, but there's a gradient between where you are and what were you aiming at, which means no more really than you're doing something. Well, you're sitting there and hypothetically you're aiming for something better and so you're in a state of insufficiency. Oh, is the DNS insufficiencies change? And then you're trying to rectify the insufficiency and you presume that your current state is less preferable to the state that you're aiming at. And then the way that you bring those two together is sometimes you can do it through thinking, but fundamentally you do it through action.

Speaker 1:          05:11          You do it through acting in the world. And so that's sort of, that's sort of the answer in some sense to the mind body problem. You have a conceptual structure, but when you implement it, you're, you're implementing it, not abstract, but you're implementing it through action. And so that's, that's the basic story. It's not a very interesting story, but it's the framework through which you view the world. So it's a value laden framework, otherwise you wouldn't be able to act and you wouldn't know what to look at. So it's a value laden framework. You look at the world through a value laden framework. So then we might say, well, what is the optimal Value Laden framework? That's what we're going to try to figure out. Now I told you about the war that went on between the communists in the West and how that obsessed me. And so one of the things that I really wondered about was what was this just an arbitrary thing? You know, like did the Communists, they had some axioms and we had some axioms and if you're a moral relativist, you might say, well, who's to say which set of axioms are better? Or even who's to claim that? You could say that a set of actions one set is better than another. That's a moral relative, this claim and Puno Fair enough.

Speaker 1:          06:30          So I thought, well maybe this is just an arbitrary thing and it's going to be settled by force because that's how you settle an arbitrary claim between two competing systems where there's no room for negotiation. So I thought about that for a long time. I wanted to know what the roots were of the Marxist system and what the roots were of the Western system. And what I surmised was that the western system was actually something that evolved. Whereas the communist system was a rationalist construction that was imposed and they weren't the same thing. And so then I wondered, well, what's western culture grounded in and is there any reason to assume that that's real in any sense? And so that's what took me into this study of the underlying stories. The fundamental stories upon which our culture, I believe is based in some of those are very old.

Speaker 1:          07:23          I'm going to tell you a Mesopotamian story. It's one of the oldest stories we know I'm going to tell you an Egyptian story. Those are sources of our culture and I think those stories are grounded in much older traditions and I think they refer to something real actually real. Now, I already told you that there are different ways of conceptualizing real and that my initial hypothesis, presumption, axiom you might say, is that pain is the most real, and the reason I believe that is because that's how people act. Now you can criticize that. You can certainly come up with an alternative conceptual framework which the scientists have because they believe that the most real thing is mattered. Maybe we need more than one set of tools to operate in the world. It's possible.

Speaker 1:          08:24          So now I want to tell you what I think the fundamental constituent elements are of stories, and one of the things that I hope is that this knowing this will make you immunize, immunize you against ideology. And the reason, because I believe that ideology is our fragmentary metanarratives narratives, and they have their power because they're grounded in the Meta narrative, but they only tell of the story, but they have power because they're grounded in the fundamental narrative. And so here's the fundamental narrative as far as the characters, let's say we're going to say that people are prone to characterize the world or social primates. We're social cognitive primates, so we tend to see the world through the lens of a social creature and so and partly because we're concerned with acting in the world and the world is mostly other people. Then we conceptualize the ground of that structure for action in characterological terms.

Speaker 1:          09:33          So the most fundamental reality is chaos and chaos is what you don't understand it all. You can't even conceptualize it. You, you come into contact with it in bits and pieces. When the twin towers fell, when the twin towers fell, chaos reigned for a few days. Everyone was shellshocked and that was chaos. And Chaos is what you experience. When your story falls apart, and that's a descent to the underworld. That's chaos. And basically you live in order, in chaos and order is where when you do what you think you should do, what you want to have happen happens, that's ordered, that's explored territory and chaos is when you do what you're supposed to do to get what you want and it doesn't happen. And then that place that you're magically in. When that happens, that's chaos and it has different depths you could say it reaches all the way to hell, and that usually happens when your life falls apart very badly, and you're down in that chaos and you realized that it was your fault and that you did something wrong and that you knew it and you ignored it. That's the worst form of chaos.
