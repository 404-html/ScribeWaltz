Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, in, in the Hobbit, for example, when, what's his name, Frodo, right, isn't, it's not Bilbo, Bilbo in Harvard, you know, he's kind of this little underdeveloped

Speaker 1:          00:13          overprotected shire dweller and he's called on a great adventure to go and find the dragon, and he asked to become a thief in order to manage it. Well, that's pretty weird, you know, it's like, well, it's because as a good citizen, he's just not enough to conquer a dragon. He asked to also become a bad citizen in some sense. He has to incorporate the part of themselves that's monstrous, let's say, and develop that and hone it. And, and that's to say that, well, if you're harmless, you're not virtuous, you're just harmless. You're like a rabbit. Rabbit isn't virtuous. It's just, just can't do anything except get eaten. It's not virtuous. If you're a monster and you don't act monstrously, then you're virtuous, but you also have to be a monster while you see this all the time. Harry Potter's like that too. It's like he's, he's flawed, he's hurt. He's got evil in him. He can talk to snakes, man, he breaks rules all the time, all the time. He's not an obedient at all, but you know, he has a good reason for breaking the rules and if he couldn't break the rules, him and his little clique of rule breaking troublemakers. If they didn't break the rules, they wouldn't attain the highest goal. So it's very peculiar, but it's very, very. It's a very, very, very, very common mythological notion. The hero has to be,

Speaker 1:          01:43          the hero has to be a monster, but a controlled monster. Batman is like that, you know, I mean it's, it's everywhere. It's the story you always hear meaning we have to be more precise.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Well, that's a good, that's a good question because one question is, you know, you're kind of implicitly moral insofar as you're socialized, but that's sort of procedural. It's just built into you. This is different. This is also becoming conscious of it and expanding out your personality into dimensions that it wouldn't normally occupy. So this happens to people all the time. So for example, lots of my clients, my clinical clients are too agreeable and I'm, they're generally women because women are more agreeable than men, but not always because I've had agreeable man, his clients as well. And what happens is they, they're resentful and they don't know how to stand up for themselves and it's because they're very compassionate by nature. And so if you're entering into a negotiation with them, they'll let you win. Well, that's not so good because you know you need to win too.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Especially if you're in an organization of adults where there's, there's a struggle, right? When you have kids can let them win. Especially infants. Like you have to let them win. And that's partly why compassion is so necessary. But as a, as a basis for negotiation between adults, it's like, sorry, it's insufficient. You have to. You have to be a bit of a monster so that you can say no. And so a lot of what you do in psychotherapy is treat people's anxiety and depression. That's a huge chunk of it. Help them straighten out the way they think. That's a huge chunk of it, but another chunk of it is, well, let's toughen you up. You know, let's put you in a position where you can bargain, let's teach you how to assert yourself and stand up for yourself and that's assertiveness training and it's a huge chunk of psychotherapy and you need to.

Speaker 1:          03:40          You need to learn it. It's like because part of how you regulate your interactions with other people is to negotiate and you cannot negotiate unless you can say no, you can't do it. And its causes conflict to say no, and if you don't like conflict, which is basically the definition of being agreeable, then you can't tolerate the conflict and so then you can't negotiate on your own behalf and so then you keep losing and you're bullied and you know it's, it's not good. Then you get resentful and, and it's really not good. So you have to develop your inner monster a little bit and, and then that makes you a better person, not a worse person. It's weird, it's weird, but, but that's just how it is. Outside of that diagram is chaos itself, and that's the chaos from which things emerge. Now, I can't tell you much about that yet because it's too damn complicated, but I think the best way to think about chaos is as potential. That's one way of thinking about it. It's also that place you end up when you don't know what to do.

Speaker 1:          04:52          It's the source of all things, but it's also the terrible Predator, the terrible eternal Predator that lurks beyond the explored domain. It's a winged dragon and it's winged. Who knows why matter and spirit. That's partly what it is, and I'll explain that later. It's also potentially the predatory beast that's been after us for for forever and the winged Predator that picked us up from the sky. So primates, for example, monkeys have some monkeys have three specialized alarm cries, one is for snakes, and that usually means hit the trees and then one's for leopards and that means hit the trees and go out on a skinny branch because the leopard can't get to you. And then there's one for like birds of prey, which means hide somewhere on the ground so that you don't get picked off. And it's like, well, that's what that is. That's what that is.

Speaker 1:          05:45          And that's chaos and, and it's expanded into much more than that. And then I showed you, I don't remember if I showed you this, but this is, this is a symbolic representation of mother, father culture and the suffering individual, but it's all that's all positive. There's no negative elements there, but that's okay. That's a partial representation. And those things are sacred in some sense because they are representative of an ultimate reality of an ultimate reality. This sacrificial individual hear the suffering individual. Well, that's pretty straightforward. It's like that's what, that's life, that's suffering, that's life, that's what happens to the individual. And so everyone is looking at that. There's a, it has power, that idea. Well, it's because you know, culture supports the suffering individual and cultures nested inside benevolent nature and that's part of the story of the world. And it's this part of the story we're trying to figure out and make articulate.

Speaker 1:          06:48          We've been doing that for thousands of years trying to make this story articulate and it's not yet articulate it. It's only we're only getting it. We're only getting it and we. We basically do that now mostly with movies and stories and fiction and that sort of thing. We still don't have it articulated. I think young went close, came closer than anyone else, young and an Eric Norman who was one of his students, came closer than anyone else ever has to actually articulate that and that's what you was trying to do is to take all these images, archetypal images, instinctual images and say, well, what do they mean? What do they mean? What do they mean? And he got a long ways on that. Although his writing is quite obscure and it's obscured because how the hell are you going to explain an image like that without being obscure?

Speaker 1:          07:33          It's like it's insanely complicated and it's not linear. It's not a linear thing that that's why it's in a picture because a picture presents everything at once and you want to take that apart linearly. Jesus, it's just, it's just impossible, but we've been struggling to do that. Really. We've been struggling to do that from the time we became self conscious, you know, what is the world about? How should we live in it? While that's a partial answer, and it's a culture bound answer obviously, but you see archetipal representations like this and many cultures, so for example, the image of the Virgin and child that way predates Christianity. Like the Egyptians, that was isis and horace that goes back. We have no idea how far thousands and thousands of years before the emergence of Judaism and Christianity way back before that and no doubt back into prehistory itself because a culture that doesn't hold the mother and child as sacred dies obviously because obviously so it has to be held as a.

Speaker 1:          08:44          It has to be held as something that you revere, which at least means you don't kill mothers and children and at least means that. And that's an instinct. You know, it's an instinct. It violates you to do that. And thank God. All right, let's take 15 minutes. So I told you about this a little bit last week, but you know, one of the motivations I had for thinking the things that I've thought through the motivation I had for thinking them through was because, well I like it, it, it, it seemed self evident to me, let's say. And I think that was partly from reading young but not. But that just helped me clarify it was that it was sort of young's contention that we had an organic development of a metaphysical ethic that was embedded in, in religious tradition and that basically unfolded, let's say in the West until about 1600, 1500, something like that.

Speaker 1:          09:52          And then science emerged and we got unbelievably technologically powerful on and using a certain view of the world. You know, we're so technologically powerful but we're still not very wise and that just seems to me to be a bad combination. And I thought about that a lot. It's like, okay, well how do you handle the combination of exceptional technological power and and an impaired ethic, let's say something like that underdeveloped ethic or one even in which you have no faith because you know, it seems that the foundational elements of it are irrational. They're there in mythology, there in religion, they don't fit well with the scientific worldview. How do you rectify that problem? And while that's a tough problem, you know, it's a crazy problem and certainly it was the problem that young was trying to address. There's no doubt about it. And along with that went an associated problem which, which was, you know, what happened in the 20th century, which was so awful and in so many places, it was just so unbelievably brutal and terrible and it was perpetrated by millions of people and they were individual people and they weren't that much different from normal people.

Speaker 1:          11:02          In fact, they were normal people. And so the other thing that struck me was that it would be better if that sort of thing didn't happen anymore. And so I was trying to figure out what the hell could possibly be done about that. And you know, part of young's contention was while you had to understand yourself as a monster, if you were ever going to maintain some control over the fact that you are in fact the monster and that that could come forth if the situation is correct. It's like, okay, that seems reasonable and so, well it seemed to me that, you know, people had to become wiser and of course that's a very difficult thing to figure out because you could even question whether there is such a thing as wisdom, you know? And, and then I thought, well that's what the universities are supposed to do.

Speaker 1:          11:46          Especially the humanities mostly in particular, it's supposed to make you wise. That's what it's for. And it's doing a terrible job of that. In my estimation. It's, it's more decimating people as far as I can tell and undermining whatever ethic they have rather than making people wise. And. But I think that we have to become wise. I don't think there's a choice. I think it's a matter of survival and it's more than that because if you're wise in your own life, you're going to have a way better life like incomparably better because you're. You're gonna sleep soundly with a good conscience at night and you know people say that's worth more than money and that's worth more than money. I know lots of people who have lots of money and let me tell you, money protects you. Your as well protected from the world by money right now as you ever will be for the rest of your life.
