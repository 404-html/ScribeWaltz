Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello Dr Peterson, thank you very much. And my question is regarding Adhd, which is something I haven't heard you speak a whole lot about, maybe a little bit. Um, now it seems to me that we are at least maybe just me do not quite understand adhd to what could be its full capacity maybe and because there's many, many voices saying that it's an overdiagnosed overblown small mental variants that's prevalent in boys or it's just young boys being young boys and then there are some that would fight and advocate for a very different treatment in the academic world. And I was wondering what you, what your thoughts are on Adhd itself. Um, and on the, whether you think it's overdiagnosed and maybe advice for me as someone who has been diagnosed with adhd on how to overcome it without maybe becoming completely reliant on prescribed medication.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:01          Okay. So first of all, it's definitely overdiagnosed. Second, it's very unreliable. Psychiatric diagnosis. Many psychiatric diagnosis are unreliable and that's because psychiatric diagnosis aren't precisely scientific categories. They're weird hybrids, right? First of all, psychiatrists aren't scientists. They're engineers. Engineers are trying to do something rather than to describe the objective world and psychiatrists are trying to make people healthy. Whatever that means. It's actually partly ethical. It's very complicated. We don't know how to distinguish it from temperamental variation, so for example, if you're high in openness and high in extroversion and low in conscientiousness, low in agreeableness, conscientiousness and and high in neuroticism, you're likely to manifest symptoms of Adhd. It's because your exploratory, you don't like to sit down, you're full of ideas. Your attention scatters across a wide variety of topics and you're not very stable. Temperamental variation is also much more common among boys.

Speaker 3:          02:14          Panksepp showed same guy with rats that if you deprive young routes of rough and tumble play, which is what the young boys are deprived of in school, let's say that they get hyperactive and then their prefrontal cortex is don't develop very well because they're not having the right kind of experiences and that you can treat that quite effectively with psychomotor stimulants like Ritalin. So that's kind of an interesting bit of scientific information that no one pays any attention to. There is also absolutely no evidence whatsoever that longterm use of psychomotor stimulants produces increases in cognitive gain, zero, and there's plenty of evidence that it's harmful. So then the second part of that was what about,

Speaker 2:          03:04          yeah,

Speaker 3:          03:06          adjustments for in the academic world, say disability adjustments. It's like, that's such a rat's nest that I don't want to even discuss it. I mean it, it, I'll discuss it for like 15 seconds. There is a never ending multiplication of disability. That's what's happening right now. The disability offices in the universities are swamp. Like I know some people have it rough, like believe me, I know that I, I, I seriously know that I've dealt with extraordinarily damaged people in my life.

Speaker 3:          03:42          You, you're, you're bloody hard pressed to find someone who doesn't have a serious problem or who doesn't have a serious problem in a close family member. It's like, where do you draw the line with regards to disability where you can't, you can't. They multiply just like lgbt identities. Multiply. Just knows. She really technically just like that. Just like intersectionality categories of oppression multiply. It's, it's, it's inevitable the way that you deal with it. As you have objective standards, you apply them to everyone. Not because that's fair. It's not fair. If you. If your criteria for fairness is that everyone has the same outcome. It's not fair at all. It's not even close to fair. It's just less piratical than the alternatives. Now we don't know that yet because we haven't seen the full range of the tyranny of the alternatives manifests itself, not in our culture, but it certainly did in other cultures. I think it's a bad idea now. I don't want to be absolute about that. Like it's tricky, you know, because if you have a disability

Speaker 2:          04:56          that

Speaker 3:          04:57          would allow you to do the work in the university and in the workplace with a modification, then perhaps the modification could be made, but I think that was done a lot better when I was in the hands of the professors and not in the hands of these crazy bureaucratic structures that have risen up around the disability issue. Like they're one of the 10 things that are going to kill the universities or maybe have already killed them possibly because they made their walking corpses as far as I can tell zombies, so and that might be wrong, but that's what it looks like to me versus I want to say thank you so much is an amazing talk and I was wondering if you could elaborate. What I noticed a lot, I go here to UBC is that a lot of students and young people, they're often desensitized to, for example, the atrocities that communism or ideologies that forced terrorism and maybe it's some sort of Stockholm syndrome that I'm seeing where it's like people are just there, they're like trapped and they can't. They feel in way they can do anything

Speaker 4:          05:58          about it and then they start to like, like, like communism or they start to see more social or adopt socialist policy that in the end we'll get them killed. We'll get them hurt. As long as you kind of elaborate on what you think can be done about that or even if something can be done in that respect.

Speaker 3:          06:16          Well, I think something can be done. I mean, I've been trying to educate people about the horrors of the Nazi regime in the Soviet regime in particular. I've concentrated mostly on those two cars, but that's good enough and trying to let people know that it was through the fault of people, much like them, that those systems are rows and, and that there are steps you can take to limit the probability that you would participate in such a thing and that those steps are associated with trying to be truthful in your speech and actions because the stability of those systems depends on the willingness of individuals to lie and, and also on your willingness to take responsibility for the malevolence in your own heart. That manifests itself in those social movements. And so that when I've done, when I do my lectures, when I do talks like this, when I put them on Youtube, what I'm trying to do is exactly that because that was the best pathway forward through such things that I could think up over 20 years of thinking about it.

Speaker 3:          07:31          Um, you know, one is so habituated to suffering that they can read the Gulag archipelago, which is actually quite hard to read without having an effect them like your psychopathic. If that book doesn't affect you, you know, it should, if you read it properly, it affects you deeply. And it's not the only example of that kind of literature. So the people who are habituated aren't, they've just been shown low resolution representations of things they don't understand that looked vaguely bad. They don't know a damn thing about them. And our education system has done a tremendously appalling job of educating young people about the absolute catastrophe of radical leftism. Now it's not much better with regards to say the actions of the Nazis, although I would say on average people are more aware of that, but they don't. But it's shallow, shallow knowledge. So you make the knowledge deep and deep knowledge changes people and wakes them up.

Speaker 3:          08:37          You know? I mean, the only reason that I ever got convinced that they're that good and evil, we're real more, more real than anything else wasn't because I learned that good was real. That's hard. That's hard. It's hard to learn that you have to find examples of transcendent good, you know, they're rare, evil. All you have to do is look, read history a bit and read it like it's about you and there's no way that you can do that without a transformation, but people won't do it. It's like you want to imagine yourself as an Auschwitz guard. That's a rough thing you see because you have to figure out, see young set, if you confronted the shadow, which was the dark side of people, the aggressive side, the malevolent side, that it, it really reaches all the way down to hell and Dante sort of was trying to put forward the same thing when he wrote the inferno, right?

Speaker 3:          09:32          With the levels of evil, right? Because it was a voyage through the levels of evil, right to the bottom. He thought the bottom was betrayal. It's pretty good. The, the most, the center of malevolence as betrayal. I liked that because to be trained someone, you have to get them to trust you, and trust is a moral virtue, right? Especially if it's courageous trust, because it it, it puts you in alignment with other people and allows you to move forward into life and if you'd be trained that you really, it's like a knife in the. It's like knife in the heart, through the back, especially if it's someone who loves, loves you, betrays you, and especially if they be trey you for your virtues. That's a really nice twist. So I believe because I think that people are capable of good, that if they know enough about evil that that will straighten them out.

Speaker 3:          10:20          So, but who wants that? You know, this is one of the things I really like about young. He's often regarded as a new age thinker. That's wrong. He's no new age thinker. He knew that the, the pathway to enlightenment was barred by the necessity of a passage through hell and that no one was going to do that. That's why there isn't a world full of enlightened people. You might say like it was just a matter of doing nice things following your bliss. Let's say however you might put it. Then why wouldn't everyone walk up the stairway to heaven? That isn't how it works. That's not how it works at all. I don't think you can be convinced of the necessity for moral action until you understand exactly how dark and terrible things can get and that it's your fault that they're getting that way. Who wants to think that? So you can think it though, but not. Not Without it burning you. So thanks.
