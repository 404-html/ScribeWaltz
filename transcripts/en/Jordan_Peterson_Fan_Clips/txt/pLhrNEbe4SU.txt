Speaker 1:          00:00          Dr Peterson thank you for coming. We appreciate it a lot. Uh, I wanted to get your opinion on censorship that we're seeing on the web. Uh, it's accelerating. You were a very notable example. You were locked out of your g mail in the interim account. Pardon me? Oh yeah. Trump just got a deleted by an errand person, you know, now they're saying that perhaps this was just a contractor and, you know, maybe, uh, someone from twitter who's gone into very far left direction a youtube has gone very far left direction. Uh, I'm just wondering, I've started an alternative to youtube called Pew Tube. What kind of, um, what, what do you see for possible solutions and just your thoughts in general.

Speaker 2:          00:47          Here's a crazy thought, but I'm going to tell it to you anyways. So I was just reading one of Ray Kurzweil's books, I think it was called how to make a mind. I really liked it actually. It helped me understand how the brain compresses information because the world is really complicated, so you have to make a low resolution representations of it to live in it. And he actually explained to me in a way that I hadn't really understood how the brain might do that neurologically. So that was cool. But you know, Kurtzweil is this guy who thinks that he's a smart guy, very smart guy, and he's invented a fair bit of high end technical technological software and hardware and he's the guy that thinks that we're heading towards the singularity. And so the singularity is, you know, how processing speed doubles every 18 months and like hard disk capacity every year and there's a bunch of doublings going on, a huge number of them and they accelerate exponentially.

Speaker 2:          01:44          And so it's probably, we're probably three years away, maybe even less than from building a computer that has the capacity to make as many calculations as reasonable estimates of the calculating capacity of the human brain are currently set out. Eighteen months away, two years away, something like that. And then we're 18 months away from having one that's twice that fast. And then 18 months away from having one that's twice as fast as that. So that's like say six years and we've got something that's eight times as smart as a human being, but there's a twist on that and this is Kurt swells twist, which is as soon as you make a machine smart enough to make the next machine that's smarter than it, which is sort of what we're doing because computers are so fast that that will scale up to near infinite computing power computing power almost instantaneously now me think no, probably not.

Speaker 2:          02:42          And Alan Gates partner has written critiques of Kurtzweil and you know, you might think if something's impossible then it won't happen even if you don't know why. And there's reasons to, to not think that that will happen. But Kurzweil's traced to back the of computing power way before the existence of the transistor and it's been ridiculously stable, crazily stable. So God only knows what we're coming up with here. You know, and you don't know what something have infinite computing power. It might be like, like you seriously don't know. And there are serious people who are very, very, very worried about that. They're very worried, for example, that companies like facebook and Google will manage that first and you know, those companies are already making censorship, ai bots and that's what that smart. It's sorta like making really fast robots that can shoot people. It's not that smart and we're doing that to very rapidly and you know, I know some guys who work in advanced Ai, you know how you look, you watch the term terminator movies and you see the robots that miss when they shoot at you, like they're not very bright because the bright ones not only shoot at where you are, but they estimate where you're going to be when you make your escape moves and they shoot their simultaneously and their death rate is 100 percent.

Speaker 2:          03:58          And so there's no war against the robots. I mean, when those things get going, they're going to be so much faster than us that will look like we're moving through molasses to them.

Speaker 3:          04:08          So

Speaker 2:          04:13          you know, so maybe what we're deciding now with all of our individual decisions about censorship and the way that we're going to construct the world and all that is exactly what kind of super intelligence we're going to bring into being. And I would suggest that we try to bring one in that's good and moral rather than one that's evil and demonic. Right? So what can we do about that?

Speaker 3:          04:39          The.

Speaker 2:          04:40          There's only one answer to that. As far as I know that that works is gay rock together. You're going to be the person who's working in Ai, right? I know some of these people, they better be good people because they're going to build whatever they're like into their machines. They better have their head screwed on straight because they're going to get amplified like mad. And I don't like what's happening with Google and facebook and youtube. They're building censorship bots predicated on a certain kind of ideology. The ideology that we outlined today. It's a very bad idea.

Speaker 2:          05:19          Hopefully good people will stop that. So then that. What that means is that your moral obligation is to be good and the way you do that is first by stopping being bad and everyone can do that a little bit. So I hope that's what everyone does because the consequences of not doing it are not going to be pleasant. They never are. Thank you. Hi, this question is about your biblical lecture series. Um, I like that one because it's about genesis, which is usually ignored as being where this post enlightenment society. We need these ancient creation myths. And also I thought revelations kind of gets the same treatment as being dismissed because it's the crazy hallucinogenic trip trip, some isolated madman in the middle of the Mediterranean. So I was wondering if after you're done with genesis, if you were thinking about doing revelation's, not without traversing the Geo geography in between. Okay. Yeah. I want to walk through the whole thing if I can do that before they expire.

Speaker 2:          06:27          So I mean I've read it and thought about it and it like, it's such a strange book, a because it's really big among the evangelical Republican types. And you'd think really, really, that's the book that's. But you're relying. Have you read it? It's, it's, it's, it's a crazy hallucinogenic trip. That's what revelation is. Now. That's not to play it down because God only knows about crazy hallucinogenic trips, that's for sure. I mean there's, there's accruing evidence. I would say that a tremendous amount of the religious orientation of human beings, deep mythological, symbolic orientation is in no small part a consequence of humanities experimentation with psychedelics substances. I think that's, that the evidence for that I think has become virtually an overwhelming. So anyways, I will get there. Maybe. Probably not because at the rate I'm going through the first stories, it'll take me forever to get there, but that's okay. So. All right, thank you. Yep.
