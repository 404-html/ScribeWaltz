Speaker 1:          00:00          So during that period of time I was obsessed is a good word

Speaker 2:          00:09          with

Speaker 1:          00:11          a question in the question was why would human beings produced two camps

Speaker 2:          00:24          and then

Speaker 1:          00:26          produce a massive arsenal of hydrogen bombs and I don't know what you know about hydrogen bombs, but they have atom bombs for triggers and you know, that's where thinking about, because an atom bomb, you know, hey, that's, that's something but a hydrogen bomb, that's the son that's really something. So, and you know, there's 20 there at, at, at the peak of the Cold War and there's, this is still true to some degree. There were literally tens of thousands of these weapons aimed at the Soviet Union then at the West. And that was enough to pretty much put an end to everything. And that's a dangerous game man, you know, and not only because of intent but also because of the possibility of accidental. Just an accident, you know, just, just a mistake or just someone who's a little crazier than you might want them to be, you know? And you might think, well no one would want to bring about the destruction of the world. But that just means you don't know very much about stellan because of all the people who lived in the 20th century who had power, Stalin was the most motivated to bring everything to an end. There's some evidence that he was murdered by Khrushchev and his crew and Khrushchev was the next leader. And if he wasn't murdered, he was at least not provided with medical attention when he was dying.

Speaker 1:          01:55          And, uh, there is reasonable evidence that he was gearing up to invade western Europe and he didn't really care how much destruction would go along with that. I mean, he'd already killed tens of millions of people. He had a lot of practice. He was good at it. It didn't really bother him. Maybe even enjoyed it. So what the hell? That's what I thought. How can it be that we're doing this? It's so insane. So then I started to think about belief systems, you know, because you could say that each camp had its own belief system. The one in the West was derived. You'd had a very lengthy history derived from the Greeks and the Romans and Jews and the Christians. And, and from various schools of philosophy and from the enlightenment and all of that, and then the Soviet Union was basically predicated on irrational philosophy that, that opposed the axioms that the West had evolved and each group organized their societies around that. And No, I took political science for quite a long time

Speaker 1:          03:10          and the political scientists and the economists, they basically thought that people competed over resources. Um, but that wasn't a very good answer as far as I was concerned because it wasn't obvious to me why people valued the resources they valued. There was the economist just assume that there's resources that you value, but you know, people can value a lot of different things. It's, it's not exactly fixed. I mean you tend to value food very highly if you're hungry obviously, but you know, there's lots of things that we value and that we want that seem somewhat arbitrary, somewhat like a decision. So I got more interested in why people valued things and what it meant to value something and then what it meant to believe something. And then how it could be that someone could believe something so deeply that they would risk their own death to protect it or at least risk the death of other people and maybe on a massive scale like, man, people are committed to their, to their system. Now you know, a system of belief is not just a system of belief. That's one of the things that I came to understand is that it's not appropriate to make this to psychological people, defend their belief systems, but that's not exactly right. You know, we have a shared belief system. Well, it's sufficiently shared so that here we are, we don't know each other. We're a bunch of primates.

Speaker 1:          04:38          We're in this room and it's peaceful and no one's scared. And, and that's pretty amazing. And that means that we're all acting out our roles. So we're acting out of roles and we have an expectation with regards to those roles. And those two things match. And that's the important thing. And we'll talk about that a lot. It isn't the belief system or the integrity of the belief system even. It's the match between the belief system. And the actions of the other people within the belief system, what you want to maintain is that match. You want to act out your beliefs in the world and you want what you want to happen. That's a good thing. You get what you want and you validate your belief system. Great, perfect security, but a lot of that is if we're interacting even right now, there's a whole set of expectations that are governing what we're doing. Like you don't want me to take your your little tablet there and smash it. That would be shocking, right? You would know what the hell to do, right? You'd be somewhere different if I did that and you wouldn't know where you were. And that's another thing to know because that's a fundamental difference. There's a fundamental difference between knowing where you are and not knowing where you are. I think it's in some sense the fundamental. You can think about it as the distinction between explored an unexplored territory, but you have to.

Speaker 1:          06:09          I don't know if you've ever taken a cat to a new house. Cats hate that and because in our old house and maybe in their old neighborhood, they slunk around, you know, at the edges, checking everything out. They start out freight, afraid it, check everything out. They know where to hide, they know where to, they knew, they knew, they know what's safe and they know that because they go somewhere and nothing happens and so then the assuming that it's safe and they slowly build up a neighborhood that they're comfortable with. My Dad used to take the dog for a walk and then the cat got lonesome and so it started to follow him and first of all it would just go along the buildings, the houses on their route, no hiding really from predators. And after a while it got kind of comfortable with that and then it would follow right behind the dog, but it had a border.

Speaker 1:          06:59          And if my dad took the dog over one street too many for the cat, the cat would just sit on the corner and, and you know, cry like a cap. Cries was like, that's it for me, man. I'm not going any farther out into the unknown. And so the distinction between the territory that you have mastered and the territory that you haven't mastered is a fundamental distinction. It's the distinction between home and the strange land. And the thing about familiar territory for people is that most of the familiar territory that we inhabit is other people because we're so social. So you can't really think it's a weird way of thinking about territory. It's not exactly geographical objective territory. It's territory with a dominance hierarchy in it and the dominance hierarchy has a predictable structure and you know where you fit in it most of the time. And so that when you act out in that territory surrounded by your people, then often you get what you want and you're so thrilled about that because you just don't want someone acting radically around you. Like and you know that. So he walked down bloor and there's people there that should really be institutionalized, but we institutionalize them all so they could be free and free to be, you know,

Speaker 1:          08:23          suffering and malfunctioning out on the street. That's what the freedom ended up being. But you know, you'll walk by someone like that who's monitoring away to the voices in his head, didn't you know, maybe

Speaker 1:          08:37          striking out against whatever it is that's plaguing him and you will make eye contact. You might even go across the street. You're certainly going to give him a wide berth. You're going to keep a distance between him and you and you're going to hope that you don't attract his attention because he's not in the dominance hierarchy and you don't know what the hell he might do. And that's unexplored territory too. That's another way of thinking about it, like we inhabit time and space, not just space and not just time. We inhabit time and space and our territories are spacial. Temporal. We're here now and this is safe now and it saved partly because of the physical structure and it's working, but it's also safe because none of you are manifesting peculiar behavior. But if you started to manifest peculiar behavior, if you stood up and started muttering or yelling or maybe attacking someone next to you, all the rest of you would freeze first because then all of a sudden this would be unexplored territory, the match between what you want, which is a peaceful lecture that you hope has some content, the match between what you want and what's happening has vanished and so then you're not. You don't know where you are. And so then what do you do when you don't know where you are? What do you do when you don't know what to do? Well, if you're a computer, you just crash,

Speaker 2:          10:10          but

Speaker 1:          10:11          you know what good is that to you? You're just going to die. That isn't helpful. You freeze first and then maybe you cautiously cautiously attend, or maybe you don't. Maybe you just keep your damn eyes averted and you sit there and you hope that no one notices you. That's a Predator prey response, right? That's like a rabbit frozen when it thinks a fox is looking at it. And we were prey animals for a long time.
