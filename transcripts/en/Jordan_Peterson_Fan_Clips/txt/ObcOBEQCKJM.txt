Speaker 1:          00:04          Very heavily muscled Oliver Mccoll 29 years old, as indeed is the reigning champion Lennox Lewis from Great Britain. It's been said that Lennox Lewis really hasn't achieved the sort of popularity in this country that he would have wished for, but certainly there's no lack of support here for him tonight. Here in the Wembley arena. Lennox Lewis, Lennox, courteous, Louis, born and West Ham on the second of September 19, 65. Comes in for the fourth defense of his WBC heavyweight title, the defending champion as home advantage. He's got a height and reach advantage and is unbeaten, whereas the challenger has got five to feats on his record. The referee officially appointed by the WBC is from Mexico, Jose Guadalupe Garcia, first of what's shed for 12 rounds of world heavyweight championship boxing, the WBC title, the man told her that to Lennox Lewis champion making us both defense of the title one and perhaps some controversial circumstances, but he's defended successfully three times and Oliver, the atomic boma, it was in the black trunks with the gold trimmed on the side as expected to be a very worthy challenger. Lewis coming in at exactly 17 stones and the goal 16 and a half stones, and just about a quarter of upon Lewis. I'm three inches taller, has that considerable range advantage, but Macole has been in with a lot of very good opponents, including Tony Tucker, the man against whom Lewis made his very first offense in Las Vegas in May of 1995.

Speaker 2:          01:53          Great

Speaker 1:          01:55          last time. Lewis was in this ring most of the feet and Gary Mason for the, uh, British and European heavyweight titles. Now Mason summit, ringside making us come back and wondering will he ever get to fight at this level again, are willing dad ever get the fight? Lennox Lewis champion Lewis, and he really needs a big one. He's not still terribly highly rated by pundits across the pond in the United States of America, whereas all of them are called, certainly is rated as number one challenge by the three major governing bodies of world boxing, WBC, the WBA on the IVF. The man who was the former spawning partner for Mike Tyson, all of them are caught in this country, is expected to give limits. There's a very hard fight and if he rips in anymore, right hands like that to the body of Louis, then those predictions will be completely correct. Louis tends to start a very tentative. They did just that in is that last title defense against Phil Jackson and Atlantic City and May of this year before getting to grips with the challenge than on winning the fight in the eighth round. It does throw a very good right hand, Oliver mcfall and Louis will have to watch that. It tends to drop was left occasionally.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Let's try to work behind the Jab. Let's rather wild by mccall perhaps wishes to pressurize the champion to get the fight over with us already as possible. I've called very heavily muscled, very strong, and reckons he's in the best condition of his life. Good right. Have a good slicing right by the champion and that's the first time we've seen about a strong punch by Louis,

Speaker 2:          03:59          but while opening first run the old arena is by no means packed to capacity.

Speaker 1:          04:08          There's a tremendous amount. What makes this a little bit of work being done just underneath his left eye. Final instruction. Then to Lennox Lewis, an interesting first one with both men letting a little bit go from the armory, but this pending

Speaker 2:          04:41          one suspects and Louis looking again behind that has got very fast hands for a big man

Speaker 1:          04:47          ethic Louis unbeaten. Remember, after

Speaker 2:          04:50          25 fights, always got him walk into her right hand. I'm not. Where's the sucker punch that they worried about? A little staggers on the referee has decided it's all over. My goodness brought an upset on Lennox Lewis. His career must be in tatters. Oliver, the atomic bomb, mccall, the 29 year old from Chicago, has stopped. Lennox Lewis, the WBC and heavyweight champion of the world, and the second rod mccall says, I told you so. I told you so reminiscent of Mohammed Ali three decades ago. Oliver them a call and his own terrorize can not simply believe it themselves. It was a right hand delivered with startling porosity and startling speed and Lennox. Drop the lamp almost imperceptibly unwoke straight onto the classic sucker punched and look at the difference in the two corners. Willis cannot believe it. His hope perhaps of a unification title with Michael, a rematch with Riddick Bowe who knows Mike Tyson and expected to come out of on a fight in the offing, simply cannot believe it because at the moment that would all seem to be completely gone.

Speaker 2:          06:04          Pandemonium, hair and the Wembley arena. A Lennox Lewis content arts with only less than a minute of the second ron gone the fraud can believe it. It was a tremendous punch. They hug and lists is smiling well as lip as very badly cut. The Not really was that bears testimony to what was correcting shop on the father of six children. The 29 year old from Chicago has done what nobody has ever done before on a stump Lennox Lewis and what time did this most of career is defined by his two losses. Then by his 34 winds, only 17. Chad's corralled by Louis Bipap, Po box numbers.

Speaker 2:          07:31          That's fewer than Lennox would want to grow to be at his optimum, frankly, isn't drawn that many punches. He's been under 40 punches. Heavyweight averages around 40 in most of his best efforts. Lennox is much busier than that. Sometimes 60 bunches around once or twice and he comes up with that right hand better. Be careful. While Lewis hasn't been busy, he has been accurate, more accurate than rock mine, but that presents the classic quandary for the better. Or is the one who lands on a higher rate, better come on blinked that way. He's having trouble and Louis goes to the body with the left top trying to get rock to bring his hands to give them another shot. At that swelling left up fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world. If you've got the so far, yeah, you to go. That's right. Don't make any looks.

Speaker 2:          08:35          Don't touch your face. Keep fighting. So far, Rachman has done a pretty good job of staying off the ropes and toward the center of the ring is disastrous moments for against Moscow and to have occurred when he had his back to the real that momentarily Louis Louis smiling at him as a result, that's what you gotta do. You fighting for the title titles. Don't take it. Excellent. Jumping right hand, Louis stopped jabbing. He can walk into some right hand does what's happening now. You're gonna walk into them to walk to the man, use your left Joe Louis with the jab right to the left up upstairs combination. Now he just buyers the right hand like a big kit man, Jack Cases Louis across the United States and the way he fought the fight you can see as taking him seriously because he's fighting and thinking was shades of Tokyo, Tokyo 10, nine slash 1992. This bike Lewis clearly preoccupied with other things in his life focusing on the national anthem. Again, one of the biggest upsets in history.
