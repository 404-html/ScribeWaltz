Speaker 1:          00:00          So imagine this, you know, you get up in the morning, you do a bunch of things and someone asks you what you're doing, what you did and you,

Speaker 1:          00:10          you know, you tell them, well the first thing I did this morning was open my eyes and the second thing was thinking about whether I wanted to go back to sleep and then, you know, I took off my blankets and then I put my feet on the floor and then I stood up and I was blinking while I was doing all this and I was also breathing. And then, you know, I looked for my claw and you really want to listen to that guy. You don't want to listen to that guy. It's like, why do you, why are you telling me that? I want you to tell me something interesting. Well, what is it that's interesting and why isn't that interesting? It's not obvious. So, so then imagine the guy actually tells you a pretty good story and a little adventure. Probably he was doing something normal.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Something unexpected happened. He had to conjure up some new responses and he either settled the problem or didn't settle the problem. Yeah, you're interested in that. Especially if he settled the problem because if he can tell you how when he encountered some unexplored territory, he was able to sew it back together, then maybe you can do that when that thing happens and how it's pretty cheap wisdom for you. It's. He had to go through all the aggravation of figuring it out. No, you have to do is listen. You know, and that's kind of a classic story. Classic Story. Roughly speaking is there's a guy or woman, doesn't matter, go into both their life relatively normally, something blindsides them and they're in a state of chaos. Chaos is the place. Chaos is the place that you end up when what you're doing and the world stopped matching and the chaos can be of different degrees.

Speaker 1:          01:51          You know, you could wake up and find that your house was burgled and you could wake up and find that a parent has your parent has Alzheimer's or some fatal disease or that you do, or that your whole family was murdered or that there's a war starting or you know there's different degrees of chaos and I think you can quantify the chaos by calculating how much of what you do and expect is likely to be disrupted by the event now because that the more disruption, the more destabilized you're going to be, which is why if, if someone tells you that you're going to perish painfully in three months, it's like that's a bad one. You're really in an unexpected territory there. Nothing that you assumed that was real. Roughly speaking in the world is real anymore. We like to watch people in their normal life blindsided by something, experiencing this inter regnum of where they explore and gather new information and retooled their character or retool the world because you could either of those would work as a solution and then come out the other side and things are better than they were to begin with, or at least as good, but better is better. That's a happy ending, right? That's a happy ending. That's a comedy, technically speaking, and so

Speaker 1:          03:23          what you want. You want your life to be a comedy. Not that it's supposed to be funny because comedy doesn't have to be funny technically speaking. It's just the opposite of tragedy. Tragedy is when you're going along pretty well and you get blindsided and that's that and you know that can certainly happen. It happens to people all the time, but it's a comedy you want. Now what I hope to provide you with, is there a magic code? You know, there was a book published a while back.

Speaker 1:          04:04          Tom Hanks was in the movie who was a harvard professor who went around solving symbolic mysteries. Do you remember what? What was it called, the Davinci Code. Everyone liked that. It sold a lot and you know, it was a little mysteries and it's full of hints that there was more to the world than you think and which is definitely true and that, you know, there was a way of getting access to that knowledge and then it would really be worthwhile and people liked that. They liked that idea. And the reason for that is because it's actually, it's true, it's true. It's true. Like, like fiction is true. So okay, let's go back to the guy who's telling you about his morning. Well, he tells you something exciting. Well then imagine that 10 people tell you something exciting and then you extract out the pattern of them dealing with this problem from that.

Speaker 1:          05:01          And so then you have a. that's what you do if you're an author, right? Because in a, in a book, you don't want the book exactly to be about what ordinary people do in ordinary times in their life. It's like you already know how to be ordinary during ordinary times of your life. What? That's not useful. You know, you wouldn't watch a video tape of yourself. Imagine you videotaped yourself during a day and then the next day you watched that. It's like God, who would want to do that? So what seems to happen in stories is that they distill, they distill, so they watch people, people watch people and then they tell stories about what they see, but they leave a lot out of those stories. Everything that's boring hopefully, and then more and more stories about exciting things get sort of aggregated and then maybe a great writer comes along and write something really, really interesting, profound character transformations, and then you say, well, that's fiction. And then you say, well, that's not true because it's fiction, but then then maybe that's not right.

Speaker 1:          06:08          Maybe it's more than true because who wants the truth? The truth is mundane reality and you've already got that mastered. What you want is the distillation of interesting experience and you might think, well, why is it interesting? Well, that's a really good question because you don't actually know and believe me, you really don't know because you'll be interested in things that just don't make any sense at all. I'm going to walk you a bit today through Pinocchio and we'll do that more the next time to, you know, but I want to tell you a little bit about that movie to begin with, just so you know, how crazy you are. So you know the plot. How many people have seen the Disney movie? Pinocchio? Okay. So lots of people. So that's strange enough in itself that so many people have seen it and it's worth thinking about. You know, you tend to show your kids that moody and. But do you think about the movie? It's, you're doing some pretty weird things when you're sitting there watching that movie, man, first of all, it's drawings, right? And they're low resolution drawings. You don't care. And you watch the simpsons or maybe fit or a. what's that called?

Speaker 1:          07:15          The the one that's been concentrating on political correctness so much south park. God, that animation man, it's just awful, right? It's just horrible. It couldn't be worse. You don't care like round heads smile, a little bit of shuffling. That's a person as far as your concern is just irrelevant. And if it was higher resolution it wouldn't help. You just need the bare bones, right? Dang your perceptions on. So. So you watch this drawing that's been oakeel beautiful drawings, animated in a sequence. You don't watching something real, you're watching a pure construction and then you think about the plot. It's like it's completely absurd. Everything about it is observed. It's like, well one of the characters is a bug and he turns out to be like the conscience and so what the hell is up with that? And then another character is this puppet Marionette and you know, somehow he gets free of his strings and then goes on this adventure and then which is.

Speaker 1:          08:21          And then he gets enticed into various nefarious places by a Fox and a cat. And then he rescues his father from a whale and you don't even know I was father God in the way. Oh, it's like the last time you see his father, he was in a rainstorm and the next thing that happens is he's in a whale and you're sitting there thinking, Hey, no problem. This all makes sense. It's like, what? Really? Why? How does that make sense? Well, the answer is you don't know. That's the thing that's so cool. You don't know. You don't even know what you're, but it doesn't matter. You Watch it and you're interested in it. You want to see what the hell happens to this puppet. You want to see if he ends up becoming a real boy because there's. It's seems important. Well, I to say, well, let's Pinocchio. True. Oh, that's a stupid question. It's partly a stupid question because the answer is it depends what you mean by true

Speaker 2:          09:27          and

Speaker 1:          09:30          it isn't obvious to me what you should mean

Speaker 2:          09:35          when you

Speaker 1:          09:37          say that something's true and I. The reason it's not obvious is because we have this idea in our society and it's. It's a very profound idea and that idea is that the ultimate truth is scientific truth that that tells us that about the nature of the world and it does that in a final way. In some sense there is no brooking any arguments about it and the physicists have got it right and that's why they can make hydrogen bombs and that's a pretty good demonstration of their being right, but you don't act as if that's true

Speaker 2:          10:17          and you don't,

Speaker 1:          10:20          and you watch things and pay attention to things in are captivated by things that aren't predicated on those assumptions and it seems to me that

Speaker 1:          10:35          there is a problem of what the world is made out of, but there's a bigger problem and that's the problem of how you should conduct yourself in the world. And that's really what you want to know. People want to know that more than anything because you need to know. It's like here you guys are in university. It's like you don't know what you're doing. I mean, some of you know more than others, but you're at the beginning of your life and life is very complex and chaotic and it isn't exactly obvious. You know, how, what kind of relationship you should form or what sort of character you should develop or what you're going to do for a job or how. What's the meaning of life? That's a good one. What's the meaning of life? Well, and you know, people come to university, at least many of them and that's kind of what they want to find out.
