1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,750
There's the People's Republic of China 
that's a different country,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,340
like seriously,
a different country,

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:06,750
right?
Different tradition,

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,950
different language.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,310
How many people died in China under Mao?
No one knows.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,660
Same issue with the Soviet Union.
Although Myra was a bigger monster than 

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,010
Stalin and that's,
that's impressive.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,310
You know,
because there's Hitler,

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,820
there's Stalin and Mao and of the three 
mile was probably the worst.

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,070
He's still revered in China.
Maybe that accounts for their affinity 

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,030
for North Korea,
which could still destroy us.

12
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:43,031
All the remnants of that horrible state.
Maybe 100 million people died in China 

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,140
during the great leap forward.
That's a hell of a leap forward.

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,760
Well,
maybe it wasn't 100 million,

15
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:51,470
you know,
maybe it was only $40 million,

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,710
but as I said before,
when you're counting in the tens of 

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,470
millions,
your points already made.

18
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:02,471
And then there was Cambodia and the 
killing fields and Bulgaria in east 

19
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:04,850
Germany and Romania and the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea.

20
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:08,000
That's North Korea and Vietnam and 
Ethiopia,

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,770
Hungary,
et Cetera,

22
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,390
et Cetera,
et cetera.

23
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,630
There was never a successful communist 
state cube I suppose came closest,

24
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,620
but it was radically,

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,400
um,

26
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,350
the Soviets poured money into Cuba.
So that doesn't really count.

27
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,020
So then the first question was,
well,

28
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:35,170
are these Marxists motivated by love or 
hatred?

29
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,330
Well,

30
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,470
is it love or hatred that produces 100 
million dead people?

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,610
Is that enough evidence or not?
And if it's not enough evidence,

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,750
if you think to yourself,
well,

33
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:54,560
that's not enough evidence,
it was never really given its proper,

34
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,600
a proper try.
It's like,

35
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:01,790
well,
why would it been a proper try?

36
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,670
See,
I always think when I hear someone say 

37
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,260
that I know what you think,
you think in your delusional arrogance,

38
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,550
that you understand the Marxist 
doctrines better than anyone else ever 

39
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,581
has,
and that if you were the one 

40
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:20,150
implementing those doctrines,
you would have ushered in the utopia.

41
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,780
That's what you mean when you say that 
and no,

42
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,770
they're there.
They saying there's an idea in the new 

43
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,060
testament that there's a sin.
It's a sin against the holy ghost.

44
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,140
If you commit that sand,
no one really knows what it is that you 

45
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,440
can't be forgiven,
and I would say,

46
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:45,441
well,
if you want a candidate for the sin 

47
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:45,960
against the Holy Ghost and the 21st 
century,

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,220
uh,
the statement communism,

49
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,370
real communism was never tried with the 
underlying idea that if you had been the

50
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:58,510
person implementing it,
it would have worked.

51
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,780
I think that's pretty good contender for
something for which you should never be 

52
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:08,851
forgiven.
All right,

53
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,670
so that's Marxism.
So let's go onto postmodernism.

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,050
We talked a little bit about it.

55
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,580
Now,
hypothetically,

56
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,510
it's an attitude of skepticism,
irony towards rejection of grand 

57
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,240
narratives,
ideologies and universalism.

58
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,080
Crit criticizes objective notions of 
reason,

59
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,910
human nature,
social progress,

60
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:40,911
absolute truth in objective reality.
It's predicated on the idea that the 

61
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:45,801
reason that you categorize especially 
that the reason that you categorize is 

62
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:48,750
to marginalize you,
categorize,

63
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:51,350
to marginalize,
to obtain power powers.

64
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,390
Pretty much all there is.
There's other elements of postmodernism.

65
00:03:57,511 --> 00:04:01,320
One of them is that human nature is 
merely a social construct.

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,370
See the reason for that,
as far as I'm concerned,

67
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,110
and this is a postmodern critique as 
well,

68
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:10,590
I'm going to move the center to the 
margin and the margin to the centers.

69
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,190
Why would you think that human nature is
only a social construct?

70
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,480
Well,
here's why.

71
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:19,560
It's because that means you could 
construct it any way you want to thought

72
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,470
it was a very common idea among this,
among the communists.

73
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:22,790
You know,
they.

74
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,160
That's why Michael wanted to wipe out 
Chinese history.

75
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:30,180
That's why the red guard wind around in 
China and trying to destroy everything,

76
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,660
every element of China's history prior 
to approximately 1960 at that great 

77
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:41,781
culture.
Thousands and thousands of years old as 

78
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:41,781
well.
So you could bring in the new man.

79
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,860
But what does the new man.
Well it was whatever slave now happened 

80
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,200
to fantasize about or it was the utopian
person.

81
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,750
You take your pick,
but like I said,

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,840
if you take a look at the corpses,
you can pretty much figure out which of 

83
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,370
those two it was.
So what's up with these people?

84
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,690
These deconstructionists sees 
postmodernists.

85
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,060
What are they up to?
Exactly,

86
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,890
but here's the first thing

87
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,080
they came about pretty much when Marxism
was no longer credible,

88
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,640
no longer tenable as an intellectual set
of intellectual propositions.

89
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:22,920
Now,
if you were a French intellectual,

90
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,820
you had to have a lot of corpses piled 
at your feet before you were willing to 

91
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,350
think that you were wrong.
So here's an example.

92
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,770
I don't remember his name.
He was the architect of the killing 

93
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,980
fields in Cambodia.
It wasn't Pol Pot,

94
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:40,530
it was one of his advisors.
Unfortunately,

95
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:45,531
I can't remember his name.
He took his phd at the Sorbonne and he 

96
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:51,111
developed the thesis in the Sorbonne 
What Marxists thesis that the cities 

97
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,960
were parasites on,
on the land.

98
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,580
You know,
it's an extension of the whole 

99
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:00,680
bourgeoisie proletarian thing.
The cities were full of bourgeois types,

100
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:05,681
educated and educated parasites 
essentially who were doing nothing but 

101
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:10,181
stealing what was rightly the farmers.
So when he came back to Cambodia,

102
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,400
he put that into action and emptied out 
the cities and put all the intellectuals

103
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,770
and the city dwellers either to death or
to work,

104
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,800
which generally resulted in death and 
killed about one six to one quarter of 

105
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:28,970
the population,
but he got his phd from the Sorbonne.

106
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,600
That's a good story because that's 
exactly how complicit the western 

107
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,401
leftist intellectuals were in 
facilitating the horrors of the 20th 

108
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,120
century and it's not like we've learned 
anything since then.

109
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Quite the contrary,
but just gone underground and that's 

110
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,520
what I see.
That's what I see when I see 

111
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,490
postmodernism.
So what happened was,

112
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,170
okay,

113
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,810
despite the affinity of Western 
intellectuals for Marxism,

114
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,430
maybe because they weren't paid as much 
as bankers,

115
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,830
let's say if we're being cynical about 
it,

116
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,080
because the thought that if you paid 
sociologists as much as investment 

117
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,740
bankers,
they'd be capitalist very rapidly was.

118
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:23,360
Which is also to say that you may 
underpay intellectuals at your peril and

119
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:28,361
you know that's actually dangerous 
because one of the things that's 

120
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:31,061
happening is that as the universities 
have become corporatized and corrupted 

121
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:35,051
in a variety of ways,
more and more of the professors or 

122
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:35,051
adjuncts,
right?

123
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:35,420
I think it's up to 30,
40,

124
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,950
50 percent,
something like that.

125
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:41,951
Now they've got no tenure,
they've got no job security and their 

126
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:41,951
paid like $24,000
a year.

127
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,710
It's not a good idea to radicalize the 
people that are teaching your children,

128
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,950
but anyways,
by the end of the sixties,

129
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,750
so much data on the catastrophic 
failures of communism had accrued that 

130
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:06,961
even the most intransigent a French 
intellectuals had to admit that the Jig 

131
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:08,020
was up.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But that's a problem because that's the 
whole ideology,

133
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,290
right?
That's the whole raise on debt.

134
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,830
You,
he says in this terrible Alberta French,

135
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,950
you're going to just give that up.
What are you going to do after that?

136
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Well,
what happened was postmodernism was 

137
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,320
invented and so it's a slight of hand as
far as I can tell.

138
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:40,321
So and,
and with postmodernism identity 

139
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:43,420
politics.
And so the postmodern transformation is,

140
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,260
well,
we were a little wrong with the working 

141
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,391
class thing.
Turns out that Communists killed them 

142
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:54,880
all and capitalists make them all rich 
and that's actually exactly the opposite

143
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:59,130
of we predicted.
But maybe there's still a way this could

144
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,710
be salvaged.
How about if we,

145
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:07,350
we don't say working class capitalists,
we say oppressor or oppressed,

146
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,340
we'll just.
Well just trends transformed the 

147
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:19,141
terminology a bit and we'll start 
thinking about all the other ways that 

148
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,621
people are oppressed and then and all 
the other ways that people are 

149
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:25,951
oppressors.
And then we can play the same damn game 

150
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:25,951
under a new guys.

151
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,870
And now look,
the postmodernists were Marxists.

152
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,900
So let's make no mistake about that.
Derrida himself said that postmodernism 

153
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,500
was a transformation of Marxism.
I'm not making this up.

154
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,650
The question is why?
Well,

155
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,840
because you could say what?
Postmodernism is a valid philosophical 

156
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,080
school and we'll get into that for a 
minute and they make some valid claims.

157
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:45,070
One of them,
for example,

158
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:50,071
this is a central postmodernist claim,
is that there's an infinite number of 

159
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:53,371
ways of interpreting the world and that 
actually turns out to be technically 

160
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,670
correct.
Part of the reason that we've had a very

161
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:59,671
difficult time building robots,
ai robots that can operate in the real 

162
00:09:59,671 --> 00:10:04,081
world,
is because perceiving the real world 

163
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,110
turns out to be so difficult that we 
really can't figure out how human beings

164
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:10,111
do it because it is susceptible to an 
infinite number of interpretations.

165
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,420
So that's actually correct.
Now I'm not going to give the 

166
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,410
postmodernists a tremendous amount of 
credit for discovering that because it 

167
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,900
was discovered simultaneously in about 
five disciplines at pretty much the same

168
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:22,630
time,
but you give the devil his due.
