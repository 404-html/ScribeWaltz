1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,360
One idea that's very common in our 
culture is that poverty is caused by 

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,811
lack of money and that's a really stupid
idea because money is very difficult to 

3
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:14,121
handle.
I had clients who were drug addicts and 

4
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:18,170
the worst possible thing that could 
happen to them was that they got some 

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,750
money.
They're just done.

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,530
First of all,
you know,

7
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:24,531
they were hanging around with people who
were little on the sociopathic side and 

8
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:29,571
so especially if they weren't that 
bright and couldn't defend themselves 

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,981
very well,
as soon as they got money while it was 

10
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:34,560
off to the bar with all the friends and 
you know,

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,580
one guy I remember in particular,
you know,

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,400
every time he got as his disability 
check,

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,210
he was gone for five days,
usually fundament a ditch,

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,460
you know,
because you just go to the bar,

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,390
spent every Saturday had on alcohol and 
cocaine and wake up in a ditch.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Three quarters dead,
uh,

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,390
eventually completely dead.
And No.

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,680
Then he was ashamed and horrified and 
repentant and he'd straightened himself 

19
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:11,841
out again.
And then that was all well and good 

20
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:13,971
until,
as long as he was broke until the next 

21
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:14,400
check showed up and then bang the same 
thing.

22
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:19,401
So you know,
it's not like money is necessarily a 

23
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:21,270
good for everyone.
It's hard manage money.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,600
It's really easy for it to disappear.
I mean elderly people have a hell of a 

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,751
time now because you know,
crooks are contacting them on the 

26
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:32,670
Internet nonstop.
And so just giving people money,

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,180
money's like,
it's like pouring water in their hands.

28
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,030
It's not that helpful.
Not necessarily that helpful.

29
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:42,600
And then of course contributors to 
poverty are well,

30
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:45,090
it's not so good to have a low Iq.
You know,

31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,420
people don't like the idea of Iq because
it seems so arbitrary,

32
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,470
you know,
have a high Iq.

33
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,930
Well it's not like you deserved it.
Exactly.

34
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:58,590
It's your setup that way pretty much 
right from the beginning.

35
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,030
It's a very,
very,

36
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,620
very,
very stable.

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,890
You can make a high Iq person stupider 
by not educating them up to the level of

38
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:12,081
their possibility,
but taking someone who has a low Iq and 

39
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:15,291
trying to raise that.
It's like if you can figure out how to 

40
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,601
do that,
well you know it's Nobel prize time for 

41
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:20,490
you because people have tried that a lot
and most recently with those,

42
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:25,491
you know,
Luminol lumosity games and that sort of 

43
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:27,771
thing and the evidence that those 
produce anything other than brilliant 

44
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:33,240
performances on the lumosity game itself
is basically zero.

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,360
We haven't been able to figure out how 
to see cause I intelligence is a cross 

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,281
domain phenomena and you can get really 
good in a single domain by practicing 

47
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:47,991
like Matt and what you'd want is to 
practice like matt in a single domain 

48
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:49,740
and hope that it generalizes to other 
domains.

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,650
That's the holy grail of intelligence 
and creeks.

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,700
It's like,
no,

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,550
no one's done it.
People claim it,

52
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,790
but the claims never hold up and people 
have been trying for a long time to do 

53
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,500
it and they haven't been able to do it.
And

54
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,720
differences in Iq really make a 
difference.

55
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,330
You know,
I mean you guys,

56
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,420
average Iq is probably one slash 25 
slash 30 ad at 1:15.

57
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:24,451
You're at the 85th percentile and 1:15
would barely get you going for you.

58
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,900
For Harvard University,
1:30,

59
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,340
you're probably graduate school material
1:45.

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,190
You're up there at the range where you 
can probably do pretty much whatever you

61
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:41,110
want.
Although as you get smarter,

62
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,570
the scatter between your abilities 
increase.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,320
So you might have a very high verbal Iq 
but not be so good at mathematics or the

64
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,470
other way around.
But it's a massive contributor to 

65
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,471
lifetime success and I don't know what 
to do about that.

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,900
I mean why do smart people make more 
money?

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,150
Well,
they get to where the edge of production

68
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:07,840
is faster.
So if you have a thousand people and you

69
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:12,841
rank order them by ICU,
the smart people are going to come up 

70
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:15,241
with new ideas first and they're going 
to have more ideas and they're going to 

71
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:17,840
strategize better.
And you know,

72
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,950
with an Iq of 90,
which is 15 percent of the population,

73
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,870
you think about that 15 percent of the 
population.

74
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,490
That's pretty much the threshold for 
reading instructions and being able to 

75
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:34,490
follow them.

76
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,190
So you know,
and our society is increasingly 

77
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,150
sophisticated,
so it's by no means obvious,

78
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,810
you know,
the Liberals think well society is 

79
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,221
unfair because there's unemployment and 
the Conservatives think while there's a 

80
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,910
job for everyone and,
but none of them think,

81
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,110
well,
there are massive,

82
00:04:55,111 --> 00:05:00,111
massive,
massive differences in people's ability 

83
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:03,380
far greater than anyone realizes.
And that poses a structural problem.

84
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,160
I had a client and I got him a volunteer
job,

85
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:11,010
which is way harder than you think.
You need a police check,

86
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:16,011
for example,
like it's harder to get a volunteer job 

87
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,310
than a real job.
But I regard them in a volunteer job and

88
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,780
he had to fold pieces of paper letters 
was he worked at a charity.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He had to follow up pieces of paper in 
three so that he could put them inside 

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,100
envelopes and,

91
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,790
and then the letters which were in a 
pile had to be matched with the proper 

92
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,790
envelopes,
which we're also in a pile,

93
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,920
but some of them were French and some of
the wrangling.

94
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:41,000
So the French ones had to be matched 
carefully to the French envelopes.

95
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,890
And then if,
you know,

96
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,460
if there was one envelope out of,
out of order,

97
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,240
well then he had to figure out whether 
it was the papers that were out of order

98
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:55,241
or the letters that were out of order.
And then some of the letters had 

99
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:59,660
photographs attached them and you 
weren't supposed to bend the photographs

100
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:04,661
and,
but they weren't always in the same 

101
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:06,041
place.
So that meant you had to figure out how 

102
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,231
to fold the paper in three a bunch of 
different ways without creasing the 

103
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,420
photograph.
And then the other thing is,

104
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,930
and I never realized how difficult it is
to put a piece of paper in an envelope 

105
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,630
until I watched someone who couldn't do 
it and he probably had an Iq of about 

106
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,000
80,
you know,

107
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:26,180
if you met him on the street,
you wouldn't think anything different of

108
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:26,300
him.

109
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,020
He was normal looking guy had some other
problems.

110
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Um,
I trained him to fold those damn papers 

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,390
for like 30 hours and he got reasonably 
good at it.

112
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,420
But you know,
if you're good at it and you probably 

113
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,621
all are,
you fold it and the edges line up 

114
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:48,740
exactly like really,
exactly.

115
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,350
The tolerance is probably half a 
millimeter or something like that.

116
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,340
Then you do the second fold and the 
tolerance is the same.

117
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,460
But let's imagine that the first full 
you,

118
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,490
you're out by an eighth of an inch in 
the second full year out by an eighth of

119
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,380
an inch.
So it's a little crooked.

120
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,140
Not means in totally route by a quarter 
of an inch.

121
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Then it won't fit in the damn envelope.
So then you kind of crumpled envelope 

122
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,220
when you put it in there and then it 
gets stuck in the sorting machine.

123
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,240
And so he sweated blood trying to do 
that job and eventually big eventually 

124
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,700
plan to fire him.

125
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,120
So imagine what that's like,
hey,

126
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,090
you know you can't get a job.
And then so you get a job at a charity 

127
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,060
as a volunteer and a charity decides to 
fire you.

128
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,240
You know?
I mean really that's just.

129
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,990
So I talked to the woman who was running
it and suggested that that might be a 

130
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,000
little on the devastating side.
I mean,

131
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,250
she had her reasons,
you know,

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,930
he,
he,

133
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,390
he was always asking people questions 
about how to do his job and you know,

134
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,430
so that meant he was interfering with 
the productivity of other people and it 

135
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,560
was genuine interference.
I mean,

136
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:08,561
she wasn't being mean and it was her job
to make sure the place did what it was 

137
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:09,590
supposed to.
So,

138
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,520
you know,
she was between a rock and a hard place.

139
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Um,
he eventually decided that the job 

140
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,691
wasn't for him and relatively soon after
that I think it was too stressful and 

141
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:25,400
uh,
he quit.

142
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,790
So that solved that problem except then 
you didn't have job,

143
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,640
which of course is a problem.
Um,

144
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,680
it has a happy ending.
This story,

145
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,700
as far as I know,
he,

146
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,800
he got a dog because he was very 
lonesome.

147
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,260
And that dog man,
having that guy trained,

148
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:43,550
that dog,
that was something else,

149
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:48,551
that dog just think he lost 30 pounds 
while he was training that dog because 

150
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:48,551
dogs,
they're,

151
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:48,830
you know,
dominant.

152
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:53,270
And he had to have a tussle with the dog
to figure out who was in charge and it's

153
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:56,850
a lot of responsibility to have a dog,
but he was pretty damn committed to that

154
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:58,650
dog.
And he managed it.

155
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,380
The things he went through to keep that 
dog.

156
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,480
You just cannot possibly imagine.
It's like a,

157
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,530
it's like a,
it's like a surreal.

158
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,500
It was surreal.
Just like the nuclear missile silo.

159
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,620
I mean,
he had people following him around 

160
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,980
informing on him because they thought he
was abusing the dog when in fact,

161
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:19,070
because I watched the dog was clearly 
abusive.

162
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Um,
so he got a job helping a woman who 

163
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,560
trained dogs and,
and then he had a job.

164
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,630
So Hooray,
you know,

165
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:35,631
but it was like a miracle fundamentally.
So anyways,

166
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:41,181
the reason I'm telling you all this is 
because there was a reason for the Cold 

167
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:45,110
War and the reason was that there is 
inequality and there's different 

168
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:51,111
theories about how to address that 
inequality and different theories about 

169
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:54,060
why it exists.
And there was a Marxist theory about why

170
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:59,061
it exists,
which was roughly something like 

171
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:01,221
property equals theft.
And those who have more have taken it 

172
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:04,911
from those who have less,
which seems to me to eliminate any 

173
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:09,330
conceptual lization that there isn't a 
fixed pot of money,

174
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,020
you know,
money expands actually as we become more

175
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,080
technologically proficient.
And lots of people who have money have 

176
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,430
it because they've generated a lot of 
wealth.

177
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,950
I mean,
Bill Gates is a great example of that,

178
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:24,420
right?
He popularized computing,

179
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:28,470
he made it possible for everybody to 
have access to computing.

180
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:31,680
It's like,
seems like a good good for him.

181
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:36,681
You know.
And you could say the same thing about 

182
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:38,871
Steve jobs and maybe you'll be able to 
say the same thing about Elon Musk and 

183
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,700
you know,
these guys have tremendous resources at 

184
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:42,970
their disposal,
but you know,

185
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,700
they're not like,
they're not bathing in bank notes.

186
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,470
You know,
they're,

187
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,370
you're trying to continue to do things 
and they use their money to do things.

188
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:53,610
And.
