1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,860
So during that period of time I was 
obsessed is a good word

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:09,810
with

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,310
a question in the question was why would
human beings produced two camps

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,490
and then

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,390
produce a massive arsenal of hydrogen 
bombs and I don't know what you know 

6
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,081
about hydrogen bombs,
but they have atom bombs for triggers 

7
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:35,720
and you know,
that's where thinking about,

8
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:36,920
because an atom bomb,
you know,

9
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:37,760
hey,
that's,

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,080
that's something but a hydrogen bomb,
that's the son that's really something.

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,130
So,
and you know,

12
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:47,830
there's 20 there at,
at,

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,960
at the peak of the Cold War and there's,
this is still true to some degree.

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,590
There were literally tens of thousands 
of these weapons aimed at the Soviet 

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,040
Union then at the West.
And that was enough to pretty much put 

16
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:05,480
an end to everything.
And that's a dangerous game man,

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,690
you know,
and not only because of intent but also 

18
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,390
because of the possibility of 
accidental.

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,400
Just an accident,
you know,

20
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,210
just,
just a mistake or just someone who's a 

21
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:19,210
little crazier than you might want them 
to be,

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,810
you know?
And you might think,

23
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:23,390
well no one would want to bring about 
the destruction of the world.

24
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:28,391
But that just means you don't know very 
much about stellan because of all the 

25
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:32,330
people who lived in the 20th century who
had power,

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,080
Stalin was the most motivated to bring 
everything to an end.

27
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,830
There's some evidence that he was 
murdered by Khrushchev and his crew and 

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,640
Khrushchev was the next leader.
And if he wasn't murdered,

29
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,480
he was at least not provided with 
medical attention when he was dying.

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,470
And,
uh,

31
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,780
there is reasonable evidence that he was
gearing up to invade western Europe and 

32
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,520
he didn't really care how much 
destruction would go along with that.

33
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:09,521
I mean,
he'd already killed tens of millions of 

34
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:09,521
people.
He had a lot of practice.

35
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:11,900
He was good at it.
It didn't really bother him.

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,170
Maybe even enjoyed it.
So what the hell?

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,930
That's what I thought.
How can it be that we're doing this?

38
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:27,931
It's so insane.
So then I started to think about belief 

39
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,660
systems,
you know,

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,200
because you could say that each camp had
its own belief system.

41
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:38,100
The one in the West was derived.
You'd had a very lengthy history derived

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,930
from the Greeks and the Romans and Jews 
and the Christians.

43
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:46,931
And,
and from various schools of philosophy 

44
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:47,390
and from the enlightenment and all of 
that,

45
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:52,391
and then the Soviet Union was basically 
predicated on irrational philosophy 

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,950
that,
that opposed the axioms that the West 

47
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,871
had evolved and each group organized 
their societies around that.

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,440
And No,
I took political science for quite a 

49
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,440
long time

50
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,150
and the political scientists and the 
economists,

51
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,320
they basically thought that people 
competed over resources.

52
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,220
Um,
but that wasn't a very good answer as 

53
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,831
far as I was concerned because it wasn't
obvious to me why people valued the 

54
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,880
resources they valued.
There was the economist just assume that

55
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,360
there's resources that you value,
but you know,

56
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,410
people can value a lot of different 
things.

57
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,510
It's,
it's not exactly fixed.

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,810
I mean you tend to value food very 
highly if you're hungry obviously,

59
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:39,240
but you know,
there's lots of things that we value and

60
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:42,990
that we want that seem somewhat 
arbitrary,

61
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,050
somewhat like a decision.
So I got more interested in why people 

62
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,011
valued things and what it meant to value
something and then what it meant to 

63
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:56,361
believe something.
And then how it could be that someone 

64
00:03:57,031 --> 00:04:02,031
could believe something so deeply that 
they would risk their own death to 

65
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,640
protect it or at least risk the death of
other people and maybe on a massive 

66
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,270
scale like,
man,

67
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:11,970
people are committed to their,
to their system.

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Now you know,
a system of belief is not just a system 

69
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,411
of belief.
That's one of the things that I came to 

70
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,361
understand is that it's not appropriate 
to make this to psychological people,

71
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:26,310
defend their belief systems,
but that's not exactly right.

72
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:28,710
You know,
we have a shared belief system.

73
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,460
Well,
it's sufficiently shared so that here we

74
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:34,410
are,
we don't know each other.

75
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,000
We're a bunch of primates.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,900
We're in this room and it's peaceful and
no one's scared.

77
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,530
And,
and that's pretty amazing.

78
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:45,230
And that means that we're all acting out
our roles.

79
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,770
So we're acting out of roles and we have
an expectation with regards to those 

80
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,940
roles.
And those two things match.

81
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,480
And that's the important thing.
And we'll talk about that a lot.

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,920
It isn't the belief system or the 
integrity of the belief system even.

83
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,620
It's the match between the belief 
system.

84
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:06,590
And the actions of the other people 
within the belief system,

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,800
what you want to maintain is that match.
You want to act out your beliefs in the 

86
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:14,870
world and you want what you want to 
happen.

87
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,170
That's a good thing.
You get what you want and you validate 

88
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:20,170
your belief system.
Great,

89
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,760
perfect security,
but a lot of that is if we're 

90
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,680
interacting even right now,
there's a whole set of expectations that

91
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:30,830
are governing what we're doing.
Like you don't want me to take your your

92
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,890
little tablet there and smash it.
That would be shocking,

93
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,540
right?
You would know what the hell to do,

94
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,960
right?
You'd be somewhere different if I did 

95
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,600
that and you wouldn't know where you 
were.

96
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,150
And that's another thing to know because
that's a fundamental difference.

97
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,450
There's a fundamental difference between
knowing where you are and not knowing 

98
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:57,821
where you are.
I think it's in some sense the 

99
00:05:57,821 --> 00:06:01,390
fundamental.
You can think about it as the 

100
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:01,390
distinction between explored an 
unexplored territory,

101
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,540
but you have to.

102
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,860
I don't know if you've ever taken a cat 
to a new house.

103
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Cats hate that and because in our old 
house and maybe in their old 

104
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,330
neighborhood,
they slunk around,

105
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,520
you know,
at the edges,

106
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,670
checking everything out.
They start out freight,

107
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:26,590
afraid it,
check everything out.

108
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,160
They know where to hide,
they know where to,

109
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,020
they knew,
they knew,

110
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,170
they know what's safe and they know that
because they go somewhere and nothing 

111
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,801
happens and so then the assuming that 
it's safe and they slowly build up a 

112
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,370
neighborhood that they're comfortable 
with.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
My Dad used to take the dog for a walk 
and then the cat got lonesome and so it 

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,020
started to follow him and first of all 
it would just go along the buildings,

115
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:51,310
the houses on their route,
no hiding really from predators.

116
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,580
And after a while it got kind of 
comfortable with that and then it would 

117
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,080
follow right behind the dog,
but it had a border.

118
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:04,140
And if my dad took the dog over one 
street too many for the cat,

119
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,810
the cat would just sit on the corner 
and,

120
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,970
and you know,
cry like a cap.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,670
Cries was like,
that's it for me,

122
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:17,671
man.
I'm not going any farther out into the 

123
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,311
unknown.
And so the distinction between the 

124
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:25,141
territory that you have mastered and the
territory that you haven't mastered is a

125
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:31,231
fundamental distinction.
It's the distinction between home and 

126
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:35,460
the strange land.
And the thing about familiar territory 

127
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,870
for people is that most of the familiar 
territory that we inhabit is other 

128
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,951
people because we're so social.
So you can't really think it's a weird 

129
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:48,361
way of thinking about territory.
It's not exactly geographical objective 

130
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:52,531
territory.
It's territory with a dominance 

131
00:07:52,531 --> 00:07:55,921
hierarchy in it and the dominance 
hierarchy has a predictable structure 

132
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:57,070
and you know where you fit in it most of
the time.

133
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,910
And so that when you act out in that 
territory surrounded by your people,

134
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,090
then often you get what you want and 
you're so thrilled about that because 

135
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,040
you just don't want someone acting 
radically around you.

136
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,340
Like and you know that.
So he walked down bloor and there's 

137
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,580
people there that should really be 
institutionalized,

138
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:21,380
but we institutionalize them all so they
could be free and free to be,

139
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,130
you know,

140
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,170
suffering and malfunctioning out on the 
street.

141
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,300
That's what the freedom ended up being.
But you know,

142
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,310
you'll walk by someone like that who's 
monitoring away to the voices in his 

143
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:35,320
head,
didn't you know,

144
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:35,680
maybe

145
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,970
striking out against whatever it is 
that's plaguing him and you will make 

146
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:46,760
eye contact.
You might even go across the street.

147
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:48,650
You're certainly going to give him a 
wide berth.

148
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:53,651
You're going to keep a distance between 
him and you and you're going to hope 

149
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:58,661
that you don't attract his attention 
because he's not in the dominance 

150
00:08:58,661 --> 00:09:00,990
hierarchy and you don't know what the 
hell he might do.

151
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,820
And that's unexplored territory too.
That's another way of thinking about it,

152
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:10,821
like we inhabit time and space,
not just space and not just time.

153
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:15,720
We inhabit time and space and our 
territories are spacial.

154
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:20,721
Temporal.
We're here now and this is safe now and 

155
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,910
it saved partly because of the physical 
structure and it's working,

156
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,770
but it's also safe because none of you 
are manifesting peculiar behavior.

157
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,730
But if you started to manifest peculiar 
behavior,

158
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,540
if you stood up and started muttering or
yelling or maybe attacking someone next 

159
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:43,551
to you,
all the rest of you would freeze first 

160
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:45,000
because then all of a sudden this would 
be unexplored territory,

161
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,990
the match between what you want,
which is a peaceful lecture that you 

162
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,621
hope has some content,
the match between what you want and 

163
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:59,380
what's happening has vanished and so 
then you're not.

164
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,860
You don't know where you are.
And so then what do you do when you 

165
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,281
don't know where you are?
What do you do when you don't know what 

166
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:08,281
to do?
Well,

167
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:09,520
if you're a computer,
you just crash,

168
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,530
but

169
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,940
you know what good is that to you?
You're just going to die.

170
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,090
That isn't helpful.
You freeze first and then maybe you 

171
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:24,050
cautiously cautiously attend,
or maybe you don't.

172
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:29,051
Maybe you just keep your damn eyes 
averted and you sit there and you hope 

173
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:30,800
that no one notices you.
That's a Predator prey response,

174
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:35,801
right?
That's like a rabbit frozen when it 

175
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,660
thinks a fox is looking at it.
And we were prey animals for a long 

176
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:37,660
time.
