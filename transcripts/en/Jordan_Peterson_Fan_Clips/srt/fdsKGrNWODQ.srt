1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,080
And No,
you know,

2
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:03,570
the evidence that are hierarchies of 
competence.

3
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:06,540
Work is everywhere because everything 
around us works all the time.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,600
Are you on hers?
The Lee tells two interesting stories in

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:10,350
her book,
infidel,

6
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:12,470
which is a great book by the way.
Um,

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,630
she came from Africa and from a country 
that wasn't very functional and when she

8
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:23,181
came to Holland she said there were two 
things that really amazed her and this 

9
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:27,261
really struck me because you know now,
and then you get lucky and you can see 

10
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,890
the world you live in from an outsider's
perspective,

11
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:33,891
right?
You get to see through someone else's 

12
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:35,481
eyes.
She said the first thing that knocked 

13
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:36,400
her off her feet was waiting for a bus 
in,

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,820
in Amsterdam,
and on the,

15
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,150
you know,
she's standing at the bus stop and 

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,730
there's a pole there and there's digital
sign on the pole and the digital sign 

17
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:47,970
says when the next bus is going to come 
and counts down.

18
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,730
And then when it hits zero,
the bus appears.

19
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,630
And she,
she just,

20
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:56,631
she just,
she absolutely could not believe that 

21
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:57,480
that would happen.
That there could be a sign that told you

22
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:02,481
when the bus would come and that it 
would change and the bus would actually 

23
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:03,120
appear and you think,
well,

24
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:03,980
yeah,
no,

25
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,250
that's a miracle,
man.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,260
That's an absolute miracle.
It is.

27
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:09,120
It is.
You got to think that through,

28
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,330
you know,
the amount of timing and organization 

29
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:14,330
and and and,
and reliability,

30
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,950
mechanical reliability and sociological 
or social organization and dedication on

31
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:24,531
the part of the bus drivers in the 
entire company and the organization of 

32
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:27,351
the whole city and the state to make 
that possible is absolutely beyond 

33
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:28,140
belief,
especially when it's time to,

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,640
well perhaps not the second but to 10 
seconds or something like that.

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,140
That is absolutely beyond belief and her
inability to comprehend.

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,160
That was the correct response.
And then the other things she was amazed

37
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:44,700
by was that you could go talk to 
policemen and they would help you.

38
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,240
That was just,
that was just a no go for her because 

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,230
for her,
her experience was policemen were there 

40
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,300
to shake you down and,
and hurt you.

41
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,160
And so you think,
well,

42
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,870
you know,
well,

43
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,470
I won't.
I won't dwell on that point any longer.

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,600
The point is,
is that it's absolutely ridiculous,

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,200
blind to make the assumption that the 
hierarchies in functioning Western 

46
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:17,610
democracies are fundamentally predicated
on power and tyranny.

47
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,460
And then,
you know,

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I can use a biological example too,
which would place me outside of the 

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,190
postmodern realm of argument because the
postmodernists don't believe in biology,

50
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:31,191
but,
but they act like they do because they 

51
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:31,191
all die.

52
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:31,191
So,

53
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,610
so,
uh,

54
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:41,940
this primatologist named.
Well,

55
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,260
I'll tell you two stories.
Okay.

56
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:44,760
Because these are,
these are really useful.

57
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:49,761
So the ones about rats,
and I got this story from Jaak Panksepp 

58
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:53,390
who is a great neuroscientists.
He wrote a book called an effect of 

59
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,181
neuroscience,
which by the way is on my reading list 

60
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:56,181
that's on my website.
It's a really good book,

61
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:58,140
affective neuroscience.
He's a great scientist.

62
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,410
He was one of the who he learned that he
learned that rats laugh.

63
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,160
They laugh out ultrasonically like bat.
So if you're going to take a look with a

64
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:07,810
pencil eraser,
they laugh,

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,840
but you have to record it and then slow 
it down and then you can hear them and 

66
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:12,840
you might think,
well,

67
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,400
rats laugh like who was creating the 
grant for that?

68
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,840
What kind of idiocy is that?
It's like,

69
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:17,410
no,
no,

70
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:18,190
no.
Just don't,

71
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:20,170
don't,
don't get ahead of yourself here.

72
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,150
You know,
he was showing that,

73
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:25,480
that that capacity for social 
interaction,

74
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,510
for social interaction that was mediated
by physiological touch activated the 

75
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,090
same,
excuse me,

76
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,850
activated the same circuits in rats,
but it doesn't people and that those are

77
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:43,840
actual biological circuits.
And we share them even with rats.

78
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,730
Now,
rats are quite similar to human beings.

79
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:50,430
As it turns out,
I could say especially postmodernists,

80
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,010
but I won't.

81
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,060
And uh,
and,

82
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,920
and so the fact that,
that,

83
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,950
you know,
that little rats giggle when you tickle 

84
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:01,950
them is actually extraordinarily 
important.

85
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,690
He also identified surprising.
I've been talking too much lately.

86
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,810
He also identified the primary place 
circuit and mammals.

87
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,780
And that's a big deal too from a 
scientific perspective.

88
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:21,781
That's like discovering a new continent,
like discovering a whole brain system 

89
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:22,480
that people really didn't know existed.
That's a big deal.

90
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,630
So here's a little story about rats.
Young rats like to engage in rough and 

91
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,320
tumble play,
especially juvenile males.

92
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,200
It's also the case for puppies.
If you've ever had a puppy,

93
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,320
dogs are like that.
They liked to wrestle and it's one of 

94
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,531
the things that male human beings tend 
to do with their offspring and it's a 

95
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,011
really,
really good thing like rough and tumble 

96
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:46,651
play with children really helps 
socialize them because it helps them 

97
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:49,740
figure out the difference between a 
touch and even rough touch and pain,

98
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,800
you know,
because one of the things you're doing 

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:55,800
when you're rough and tumble playing 
with the little kid is,

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,221
you know,
you throw them up in the air and you're 

101
00:04:59,221 --> 00:04:59,221
wrestling around.

102
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:01,470
I built my,
I had two couches when my kids were 

103
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,961
little that were sort of face to face.
So we built this little wrestling ring 

104
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:05,410
and I used to go in there and pound them
half to death every night,

105
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,090
you know,
so they loved that.

106
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:07,570
I mean,
they,

107
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,150
they get so excited about that they love
that so much.

108
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:15,151
It's just crazy,
but the reason for that is like you're 

109
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:17,821
stretching out their bodies and you're 
showing them that they can't put their 

110
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:19,310
thumb in your eye and you're teaching 
them to be graceful and,

111
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:24,311
and,
and you're teaching them the difference 

112
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,510
between something new that's happening 
to the body and something painful.

113
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,630
You're really teaching them to dance and
it's this really complicated 

114
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,910
physiological dance that that is 
indicative of a socialized being.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's partly why women like men who can
dance by the way because it seems shows 

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,500
that you can pay attention to someone 
else first of all,

117
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:46,501
that you're coordinated,
but even more importantly that you can 

118
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:49,021
take the fact of your coordination and 
coordinate that with someone else's 

119
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:49,030
coordination.

120
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,540
So,
and that's very primal and 

121
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,191
physiological.
It's built right into your body and 

122
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:56,191
rough and tumble play helps with that a 
lot.

123
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Anyways,
rats also like to rough and tumble play 

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,130
for much the same reasons and sort of 
sort of pretty much all social mammals.

125
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,840
So you can tell that rats like it 
because he,

126
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,600
uh,
how do you know if a rat like something?

127
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,630
Well,
he'll work for it and one of the ways 

128
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,200
you can figure out if rat wants to work 
for something is that no,

129
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,220
you get them in a state where maybe he's
desperate for whatever he's working for 

130
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,111
and you can put a little spring on them 
and figure out how hardy poles to go 

131
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:23,810
somewhere.
He knows where he's going to get that.

132
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,690
And then you can measure the force that 
he's willing to apply and that gives you

133
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:28,550
a rough estimate of his motivation.

134
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,520
Or maybe ask a bar,
press like a,

135
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,700
you know,
like a coke,

136
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,760
cocaine addicted rats to,
to receive the reward and you can count 

137
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,081
rate of bar pressing and you can get an 
estimate of how excited the route is to 

138
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:41,180
go do whatever it is the rats going to 
do.

139
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:46,181
And so panksepp used to put rats.
It pair them one riot against the other 

140
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,970
in kind of a play arena.
Not a very big thing.

141
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,460
And uh,
and the,

142
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,430
these were juvenile males and they would
work to do that.

143
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Okay.
So they liked it and then maybe one rat 

144
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,820
was 10 percent bigger than the other.
And then when you paired them,

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
the big rat would beat the little rat 
because 10 percent weight advantage was 

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,550
enough to make the bigger dominant.
Okay.

147
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,250
So then they established basically 
dominance and submission.

148
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,620
You might think about that as a power 
relationship.

149
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,590
And to some degree it is,
but it's more complicated than that.

150
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:16,940
And this is very important.
So.

151
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,510
So the rats play together once and the,
a big rat pins the little rat really 

152
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:30,221
very much like wrestling,
like rats wrestle just like people 

153
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:30,221
wrestle.

154
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,970
And if you pair them together then the 
big rat can pin the little rat.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay.
So now you've got dominant subordinate 

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
rat roughly speaking.
And,

157
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,940
but then you see if you stop the 
experiment there,

158
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:48,941
you'd think,
well the rats play to establish 

159
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:49,400
dominance and submission.
But the thing is is that rats don't just

160
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,540
play once,
they play many,

161
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,650
many,
many times.

162
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,880
And that's also the case with human 
beings is that you don't just play once,

163
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,240
you play many,
many times and there's a difference 

164
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,750
between the rules of a game and the 
rules of a set of games.

165
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,290
And that's so unbelievably important.
So you keep that in mind because we'll 

166
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:08,290
return to that.
So anyways,

167
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,260
the next time the two rats get together,
the little rat has to ask the big rat to

168
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:17,261
play it because the rule basically is 
subordinate entity asks dominant entity 

169
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:17,261
to play.

170
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,280
And so the little rat does what mammals 
do to play,

171
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:24,260
you know,
they kind of put their paws down and put

172
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,390
the rear end up,
bit up in the air.

173
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,090
You see dogs do that.
And unless you're completely clueless,

174
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:34,091
you know that,
that doesn't mean he's going for your 

175
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:36,191
throat,
means he wants you to whack them on the 

176
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:36,191
side of the head so he can sort of 
pretend to bite you.

177
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:36,970
You know,
it's,

178
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,160
it's pretty obvious if you've played 
with dogs and children.

179
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,820
So,
um,

180
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,270
yeah,
and I make that comparison because dogs 

181
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:47,270
and children understand each other,
right?

182
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,590
They're pack animals.
They followed the same basic rules.

183
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:50,480
They know how to play.
They can become friends,

184
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,160
otherwise you wouldn't have them as 
pets.

185
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,780
I mean the dogs,
not the children.

186
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,140
So anyways,
the little rat ass,

187
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,390
the big Rut to play big wrap things.
So yeah.

188
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:00,950
Yeah.
Okay.

189
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:01,620
Yeah.
We'll will play.

190
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:04,260
They wrestle and you pair them multiple 
times.

191
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:09,261
Well if you pair the multiple times,
what you find is that less the big rat 

192
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:12,411
lets the little rat win 30 percent of 
the time the little rat won't ask the 

193
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:13,200
big rat to play anymore and that you 
think,

194
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,260
well who cares?
What?

195
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,190
Like why is that important?
It's like it's really important.

196
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:21,780
That's a really important discovery 
because it shows you that that even rats

197
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:25,320
have a set set,
a sense of fair play that emerges across

198
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:27,460
iterated games.
It sits,

199
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,510
it's an.
It's evidence for the biological 

200
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,000
instantiation of a social morality.
It's a big deal,

201
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,470
man.
That's a big discovery and,

202
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,130
and it shows you that even at the level 
of rats,

203
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:43,131
they're very social animals by the way.
The interactions between rats,

204
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:47,640
her are mediated by something like a 
sense of fairness or justice,

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,970
and so that's extremely cool because you
know,

206
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:55,971
we tend to think of animals as having 
dominance hierarchies and that's 

207
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,941
predicated on power and that idea,
even though the bloody postmodernists 

208
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:02,691
don't believe in biology,
they extend that analogy up to human 

209
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:02,691
beings.
It's just not true.
