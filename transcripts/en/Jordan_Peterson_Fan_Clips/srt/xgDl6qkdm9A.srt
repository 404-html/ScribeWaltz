1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,860
Chimps are brutal creatures,
man,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,340
like they go to war a and so if you have
a chimp territory out in the jungle,

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:11,100
then the the juveniles will,
the males in particular,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,050
the band together in groups of four or 
five.

5
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:15,720
There's often but not always a female or
two with them,

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,110
and if they come across chimps from 
another troupe that aren't within their 

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,040
hierarchy,
let's say they will,

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,070
if they're,
if they outnumber them because they 

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,960
can't really count,
but they can estimate magnitude 

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:29,960
visually.
It's not the same as counting,

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,410
but if they outnumber them,
they will tear them to pieces and chimps

12
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:37,890
or at least twice as strong as a really 
well developed human male.

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,880
And so they can tear you up pretty good.
And chimps are perfectly capable.

14
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,881
They hunt,
they're carnivorous like human beings 

15
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:46,881
and they hunt,
they hunt,

16
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:51,651
call a monkeys often they weigh about 40
pounds and they'll basically eat them 

17
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:51,651
alive.

18
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,030
A monkey screaming away like mad because
you know,

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,300
it's in pain because it's being eaten.
And um,

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,690
that doesn't slow the chimps down a bit.
There's no cross species empathy 

21
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,080
stopping them from having their snack.
And so,

22
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:09,081
chimps are very brutal creatures and uh,
it isn't obvious they have a lot of 

23
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:11,700
internal inhibition of their aggression 
at all.

24
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:15,810
Most of the inhibition is sociological,
it's out in the hierarchy.

25
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:20,811
And so the reason chimps aren't always 
aggressive with one another is because 

26
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:24,440
they know who can pound them and,
and who will gang up on them and who 

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,140
won't be established their hierarchy 
anyways.

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,460
You know,
you think about a champ hierarchy and 

29
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:31,830
you're talking about a fairly strong and
aggressive creature.

30
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:33,600
You might think it's biggest,
ugliest,

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,630
meanest,
most vicious,

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,200
irritable,
unpleasant chimp that rises to the top.

33
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,450
We're all,
that's kind of the postmodernist view of

34
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,410
human society.

35
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,960
But that's not the case.
It happens sometimes.

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,260
But what happens in dwell has documented
this quite nicely,

37
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:53,760
is that tyron chimps lead unstable 
regimes.

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,790
Now,
you know,

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,800
that might sound familiar because the 
same thing of course is true human 

40
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:00,800
beings.
And why is that?

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,530
Well,
it's because you know,

42
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:04,740
people don't like tyrants and chimps 
don't like them that much either.

43
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:08,040
And chimps are actually quite reciprocal
in their social interactions.

44
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,740
So they don't just dominate each other,
they groom each other,

45
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:13,740
they have friendships,
they can track social relationships over

46
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:18,741
very long periods of time now and they 
do that and so they engage in reciprocal

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,280
interactions,
let's say prosocial reciprocal 

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,820
interactions and you might think,
well what's the,

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,550
what's the weak point of the biggest,
ugliest,

50
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:33,300
toughest chimp in the troop?
And that is he doesn't have any friends.

51
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,650
And so,
you know,

52
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:39,651
maybe as a bad day is a little hung over
or whatever for eating fermented bananas

53
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:44,200
or whatever he is partying with and to 
have the slightly less ugly,

54
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,710
less slightly less mean.
Chimps decide,

55
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:49,860
well this is a good time to take them 
out and they tear him to pieces.

56
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,390
And so one of the things to Wallace 
pointed out quite nicely is that if you 

57
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,660
want to have a stable chimp dominance 
hierarchy,

58
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:02,661
let's call it a regime,
the stable ones aren't ruled by the 

59
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:04,330
tyrants because tyrants get taken out 
by,

60
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,220
by paired up friendship dyads,
something like that.

61
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,200
So that's really worth thinking about 
too,

62
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,850
you know,
because

63
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,890
because it indicates that even in 
creatures that have less complex 

64
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,060
sociological orders and they do because 
one of the things that predicts how 

65
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:31,131
complex your social order is,
how big your brain is compared to your 

66
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:31,570
body,
it's encephalization essentially,

67
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:36,571
and the more encephalitis to creature,
the larger the social groups that 

68
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:40,161
contract.
And of course human beings are very 

69
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:40,161
highly encephalitis.
So we have quite complicated group,

70
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:44,810
um,
we have quite complicated group 

71
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,211
organizations,
but even in simpler group organizations 

72
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:50,571
like the chimps,
it isn't the tyrant who rule stable and 

73
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:53,160
that turns out to be also incredibly 
important.

74
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,500
Okay.
So,

75
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,390
so,
so much for the idea that power is the 

76
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,390
only game in town.
Then you got to ask.

77
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,500
The question is,
well,

78
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,040
this is actually a postmodern question.
So you know,

79
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,250
one of the things Dennis said that the 
main postmodern joker is that by 

80
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,310
categorizing you,
you,

81
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,340
you privilege one concept and you pray,
you force other concepts out to the 

82
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,340
margins.

83
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,420
And so he believed that when you 
construct it a hierarchy of power,

84
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,020
that the hierarchy of power,
privilege certain people and 

85
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,501
marginalized others,
and you know that's really not that 

86
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:31,320
brilliant and observation as far as I'm 
concerned,

87
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:34,560
it's rather commonplace.
All it means is that when you categorize

88
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:39,561
something that there are things that are
in the category and a bunch of things 

89
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:40,740
that aren't and so you actually can't 
categorize anything,

90
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:42,510
which meant means you can't perceive 
anything,

91
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:47,160
which means you can't think or live 
without making some things in the middle

92
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,390
and everything else on the outside,
it's.

93
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,570
It's part of categorization itself.
And so maybe the postmodernist would go 

94
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,180
far enough to question the utility of 
categorization itself.

95
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:59,340
And I think to some degree they do do 
that.

96
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,580
But I'm the point here is that if you.

97
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,390
You have to ask why it is that you 
would,

98
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,450
if you were a postmodernist yourself,
why it is that you would privilege the 

99
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,621
idea of power above all else.
So exactly what is it that you're 

100
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:25,460
pushing to the margin.
And so that's something that we're going

101
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:26,480
to talk about.
Now,

102
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,490
here's one thing you might push to the 
margin.

103
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:33,491
Let's say that you believe that 
hierarchies are a consequence of power.

104
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Well then you push competence to the 
margin and then applying the postmodern 

105
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,610
modernist logic.
You might say,

106
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,790
well,
the reason you're privileging power is 

107
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,490
so that you can produce so that you 
could push competence to the margin,

108
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,760
and so you want to keep that in mind 
too,

109
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:53,030
because that's going to become important
as we discussed the relationship between

110
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:58,031
postmodernism and Marxism.
Maybe you're after the destruction of 

111
00:05:58,031 --> 00:05:58,370
the idea competence itself.

112
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,440
All right,
so

113
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,060
froggy postmoderns and we talked about 
it a little bit.

114
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,090
We'll return to it.
Now we're going to talk a little bit 

115
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,450
about Marxism.
I've got a quote here from mark's.

116
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:15,420
The proletarians have nothing to lose,
but our chains.

117
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Well,
I was pretty good for like 1880 or 1890 

118
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,430
or whenever it was he wrote at somewhere
around that period of time it turned out

119
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:25,160
the proletarians had a lot more to lose 
than their chains.

120
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,160
They had their lives and their families 
to lose.

121
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,330
That was demonstrated and play as a 
consequence of the.

122
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,290
What would you call it,
the sociological movements that were put

123
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:41,291
into place when the Marxist 
presuppositions began to govern 

124
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,800
societies like the Soviet Union.
So,

125
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,950
all right,
so let's take the same postmodernist 

126
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,030
approach.
So here's some basic tenants of Marxism.

127
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,840
It's Berge Lousy against proletariat.
The bridge was the year,

128
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:56,000
the capitalists,
the property owners,

129
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,830
those sorts of people,
the proletariat,

130
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:00,800
the working class,
for all intents and purposes.

131
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,510
The basic idea is that history itself is
nothing but the,

132
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,260
what would you call it,
the documentation of the struggle of one

133
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,520
class against the other.

134
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:11,890
Um,

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,160
okay.
Um,

136
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,800
no,
like,

137
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,080
that's wrong,
but it's okay because it's too simple.

138
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,110
Obviously.
It's obviously too simple.

139
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:23,630
There's all sorts of motivations that 
people have.

140
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:26,540
Some of them are economic,
some of them are associated with power.

141
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,580
Um,

142
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,160
but that's okay.
We will leave that.

143
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,820
Let's,
let's give the devil his due and say,

144
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:32,330
well,
yeah,

145
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:37,331
fair enough.
There's still a fair bit of tension 

146
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:37,331
between the haves and the haves and have
nots.

147
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,920
And maybe that was even more intense in 
previous societies than it is now.

148
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:44,921
And it's no,
there's no doubt that economics plays a 

149
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:47,381
role in,
in virtually everything that human 

150
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:47,381
beings do in a fairly significant role.
So let,

151
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:49,180
let's,
let's accept that as a

152
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,660
potential theory.
It's,

153
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:51,890
it's simple,
but maybe it's

154
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,040
practically useful.
And then there's kind of an offshoot of 

155
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,040
that theory,
which is that,

156
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,350
well,
if you're a Marxist,

157
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,450
that means you have sympathy for the 
working class,

158
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:04,451
right?
Because that's what you're saying all 

159
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:04,451
the time.
It's like,

160
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:04,451
well,
the poor working class,

161
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:04,490
they're all oppressed.
The poor,

162
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,650
poor proletariat,
you know?

163
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,180
And,
and then you're also saying,

164
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:11,780
well we're the good guys because we're 
standing on the side of the oppressed.

165
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,680
And so then you might also ask what 
you're marginalizing when you claim that

166
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:20,681
you're the good guys because one of the 
things that you would be marginalizing 

167
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:21,350
is all of the ways in which you're not 
the good guys,

168
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:23,960
but we can leave that aside for a moment
too.

169
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,240
So,
but there's the claims is that,

170
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,050
you know,
there's the working class against the 

171
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,640
ruling class.
Another claim is the ruling class is the

172
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:35,550
ruined class because they exploited the 
working class,

173
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,460
basically stealing their excess labor 
from them.

174
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,080
Um,
another very,

175
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,170
very,
you're a what,

176
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,510
a surfacely attractive claim that lacks 
any reasonable justification because 

177
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,860
it's predicated on the idea of the world
as a zero sum game.

178
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,230
And clearly the world is not a zero sum 
game.

179
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,560
So when someone creates wealth,
when someone is wealthy,

180
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:04,290
it can be at least at times because they
created it,

181
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,420
not because they swiped it from someone 
else.

182
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,160
I think,
you know,

183
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,460
you can think of someone like Bill Gates
or Steve Jobs is a good example of that.

184
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,620
Um,
you know,

185
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:18,621
they're,
they're what they produced had a value 

186
00:09:18,621 --> 00:09:22,011
that far exceeded what they garnered as 
a consequence of their production even 

187
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:22,950
though what they garnered was fairly 
substantial.

188
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,810
So anyways,
but we'll get,

189
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:26,640
like you said,
we're going to give the devil his due.

190
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:31,641
Okay.
It's the bourgeoisie against the 

191
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:33,321
proletariat will accept that.
It's class warfare is the primary 

192
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:33,540
historical mover.

193
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,550
No problem.
Now,

194
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,280
but here's what I'm not willing to give 
away so easily.

195
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,590
Uh,
we have sympathy for the working class 

196
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,790
primarily and we're good because of 
that.

197
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,390
No,
I'm not gonna like,

198
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,510
give that away.
So simply.

199
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,660
So let's investigate that a little bit.
Let's see if we can actually figure it 

200
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:53,660
out.
If that's true,

201
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,910
we'll say a use a pragmatic approach 
because I'm a pragmatist in that William

202
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,970
James,
Sansa,

203
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,910
uh,
or maybe you can think about it even 

204
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:06,910
more deeply in anciently.
Uh,

205
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,040
there's a statement in the New 
Testament,

206
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,280
I think it's by their fruits,
you shall know the fine.

207
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,490
So we're going to walk down that road,
um,

208
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,940
before we do that.
So now that's another thing you have to 

209
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:19,940
keep in mind.
Before we do that,

210
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,180
I want to make one more detour.
Okay.

211
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,300
So I like making detours and then 
tangling all back together.
