1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,000
Very heavily muscled Oliver Mccoll 29 
years old,

2
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:11,720
as indeed is the reigning champion 
Lennox Lewis from Great Britain.

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:19,450
It's been said that Lennox Lewis really 
hasn't achieved the sort of popularity 

4
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,390
in this country that he would have 
wished for,

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,210
but certainly there's no lack of support
here for him tonight.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,610
Here in the Wembley arena.
Lennox Lewis,

7
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:26,500
Lennox,
courteous,

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,540
Louis,
born and West Ham on the second of 

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:31,540
September 19,
65.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,920
Comes in for the fourth defense of his 
WBC heavyweight title,

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,320
the defending champion as home 
advantage.

12
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:41,750
He's got a height and reach advantage 
and is unbeaten,

13
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,900
whereas the challenger has got five to 
feats on his record.

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,240
The referee officially appointed by the 
WBC is from Mexico,

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Jose Guadalupe Garcia,
first of what's shed for 12 rounds of 

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,160
world heavyweight championship boxing,
the WBC title,

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,280
the man told her that to Lennox Lewis 
champion making us both defense of the 

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,930
title one and perhaps some controversial
circumstances,

19
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:17,430
but he's defended successfully three 
times and Oliver,

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,440
the atomic boma,
it was in the black trunks with the gold

21
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:25,880
trimmed on the side as expected to be a 
very worthy challenger.

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,250
Lewis coming in at exactly 17 stones and
the goal 16 and a half stones,

23
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,900
and just about a quarter of upon Lewis.
I'm three inches taller,

24
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,910
has that considerable range advantage,
but Macole has been in with a lot of 

25
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,670
very good opponents,
including Tony Tucker,

26
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,010
the man against whom Lewis made his very
first offense in Las Vegas in May of 

27
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,110
1995.

28
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,440
Great

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:00,550
last time.
Lewis was in this ring most of the feet 

30
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,231
and Gary Mason for the,
uh,

31
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,320
British and European heavyweight titles.
Now Mason summit,

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,340
ringside making us come back and 
wondering will he ever get to fight at 

33
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,140
this level again,
are willing dad ever get the fight?

34
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:20,141
Lennox Lewis champion Lewis,
and he really needs a big one.

35
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:27,841
He's not still terribly highly rated by 
pundits across the pond in the United 

36
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,710
States of America,
whereas all of them are called,

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,720
certainly is rated as number one 
challenge by the three major governing 

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,060
bodies of world boxing,
WBC,

39
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:43,061
the WBA on the IVF.
The man who was the former spawning 

40
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:53,270
partner for Mike Tyson,
all of them are caught in this country,

41
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,660
is expected to give limits.
There's a very hard fight and if he rips

42
00:02:56,661 --> 00:03:01,661
in anymore,
right hands like that to the body of 

43
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,411
Louis,
then those predictions will be 

44
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:06,571
completely correct.
Louis tends to start a very tentative.

45
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,530
They did just that in is that last title
defense against Phil Jackson and 

46
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,271
Atlantic City and May of this year 
before getting to grips with the 

47
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:17,080
challenge than on winning the fight in 
the eighth round.

48
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,050
It does throw a very good right hand,
Oliver mcfall and Louis will have to 

49
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,720
watch that.
It tends to drop was left occasionally.

50
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,810
Let's try to work behind the Jab.
Let's rather wild by mccall perhaps 

51
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,060
wishes to pressurize the champion to get
the fight over with us already as 

52
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,991
possible.
I've called very heavily muscled,

53
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:49,071
very strong,
and reckons he's in the best condition 

54
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:49,071
of his life.
Good right.

55
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:51,270
Have a good slicing right by the 
champion and that's the first time we've

56
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:53,520
seen about a strong punch by Louis,

57
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,880
but while opening first run the old 
arena is by no means packed to capacity.

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,840
There's a tremendous amount.
What makes this a little bit of work 

59
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:23,821
being done just underneath his left eye.
Final instruction.

60
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:36,221
Then to Lennox Lewis,
an interesting first one with both men 

61
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,060
letting a little bit go from the armory,
but this pending

62
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,660
one suspects and Louis looking again 
behind that has got very fast hands for 

63
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,770
a big man

64
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,700
ethic Louis unbeaten.
Remember,

65
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,050
after

66
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,900
25 fights,
always got him walk into her right hand.

67
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,230
I'm not.
Where's the sucker punch that they 

68
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,490
worried about?
A little staggers on the referee has 

69
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,300
decided it's all over.
My goodness brought an upset on Lennox 

70
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,020
Lewis.
His career must be in tatters.

71
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,070
Oliver,
the atomic bomb,

72
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,610
mccall,
the 29 year old from Chicago,

73
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,530
has stopped.
Lennox Lewis,

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,770
the WBC and heavyweight champion of the 
world,

75
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:21,680
and the second rod mccall says,
I told you so.

76
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:26,681
I told you so reminiscent of Mohammed 
Ali three decades ago.

77
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,170
Oliver them a call and his own terrorize
can not simply believe it themselves.

78
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,630
It was a right hand delivered with 
startling porosity and startling speed 

79
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,430
and Lennox.
Drop the lamp almost imperceptibly 

80
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,540
unwoke straight onto the classic sucker 
punched and look at the difference in 

81
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,020
the two corners.
Willis cannot believe it.

82
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,920
His hope perhaps of a unification title 
with Michael,

83
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,610
a rematch with Riddick Bowe who knows 
Mike Tyson and expected to come out of 

84
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,580
on a fight in the offing,
simply cannot believe it because at the 

85
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,830
moment that would all seem to be 
completely gone.

86
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,520
Pandemonium,
hair and the Wembley arena.

87
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,730
A Lennox Lewis content arts with only 
less than a minute of the second ron 

88
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,860
gone the fraud can believe it.
It was a tremendous punch.

89
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,760
They hug and lists is smiling well as 
lip as very badly cut.

90
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:24,761
The Not really was that bears testimony 
to what was correcting shop on the 

91
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,160
father of six children.
The 29 year old from Chicago has done 

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,331
what nobody has ever done before on a 
stump Lennox Lewis and what time did 

93
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,600
this most of career is defined by his 
two losses.

94
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,280
Then by his 34 winds,
only 17.

95
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:27,940
Chad's corralled by Louis Bipap,
Po box numbers.

96
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,220
That's fewer than Lennox would want to 
grow to be at his optimum,

97
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,420
frankly,
isn't drawn that many punches.

98
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,950
He's been under 40 punches.
Heavyweight averages around 40 in most 

99
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:45,950
of his best efforts.
Lennox is much busier than that.

100
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:50,951
Sometimes 60 bunches around once or 
twice and he comes up with that right 

101
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:53,280
hand better.
Be careful.

102
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,760
While Lewis hasn't been busy,
he has been accurate,

103
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,940
more accurate than rock mine,
but that presents the classic quandary 

104
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,511
for the better.
Or is the one who lands on a higher 

105
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:11,581
rate,
better come on blinked that way.

106
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,580
He's having trouble and Louis goes to 
the body with the left top trying to get

107
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:22,730
rock to bring his hands to give them 
another shot.

108
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:27,731
At that swelling left up fighting for 
the heavyweight championship of the 

109
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:31,230
world.
If you've got the so far,

110
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,410
yeah,
you to go.

111
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,140
That's right.
Don't make any looks.

112
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,740
Don't touch your face.
Keep fighting.

113
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,610
So far,
Rachman has done a pretty good job of 

114
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,711
staying off the ropes and toward the 
center of the ring is disastrous moments

115
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,880
for against Moscow and to have occurred 
when he had his back to the real that 

116
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,140
momentarily Louis Louis smiling at him 
as a result,

117
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,830
that's what you gotta do.
You fighting for the title titles.

118
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,490
Don't take it.
Excellent.

119
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:10,491
Jumping right hand,
Louis stopped jabbing.

120
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,520
He can walk into some right hand does 
what's happening now.

121
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,420
You're gonna walk into them to walk to 
the man,

122
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,430
use your left Joe Louis with the jab 
right to the left up upstairs 

123
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:29,190
combination.
Now he just buyers the right hand like a

124
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,600
big kit man,
Jack Cases Louis across the United 

125
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,330
States and the way he fought the fight 
you can see as taking him seriously 

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
because he's fighting and thinking was 
shades of Tokyo,

127
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,060
Tokyo 10,
nine slash 1992.

128
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,080
This bike Lewis clearly preoccupied with
other things in his life focusing on the

129
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,630
national anthem.
Again,

130
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,800
one of the biggest upsets in history.
