1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,080
You can hear me ?
Here we go.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,090
Thank you,
Mr Hillier,

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,880
that's for the introduction and also for
the invitation.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,480
So not everyone will invite me places.
So it's nice when an invitation shows 

5
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:23,031
up,
yeah and when I'm actually allowed to 

6
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:23,031
speak,
that's also good.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,460
So I have a habit of not preparing my 
talks until really the last minute.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,900
And I mean that's not exactly true 
because I've been thinking about what 

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,020
I'm going to talk to you about tonight 
for a very long time,

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:42,021
but I really only got the title for this
talk firmly in place about half an hour 

11
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:45,030
ago.
And,

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,450
and one of the things I like to do when 
I'm speaking to people is to tell them 

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,660
what I'm thinking about,
not what I've already thought about,

14
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:53,370
you know,
and certainly not what I know,

15
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:55,590
but what I'm thinking about,
what I'm trying to figure out.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,120
And so one of the things that's happened
to me over the last year,

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,360
somewhat surprisingly,
is that I've been invited to speak in 

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,640
front of a lot of conservative groups 
and uh,

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,130
a lot of them were conservative groups 
that were composed of young people.

20
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,900
And that was interesting,
you know,

21
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:17,901
because conservatism isn't something 
that's necessarily all that easy to sell

22
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:23,400
to young people because they tend not to
be that conservative to begin with.

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,410
And conservatism also tends to have 
quite a lot to do with things that you 

24
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,480
shouldn't do and instead of things that 
you might be allowed to do.

25
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:35,481
And so there's a restrictive element of 
it that's also perhaps less attractive 

26
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:39,171
to young people than it might be.
People do tend to get more conservative 

27
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:39,810
as they get older,
as their personality shift.

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,260
And so,
but what I saw was very interesting 

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,541
because I saw this was particularly true
of young men and I haven't quite puzzled

30
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:49,950
that out yet,
but,

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,260
you know,
I would talk about what was going on in 

32
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,591
the universities and what I thought 
might constitute a reasonable antidote 

33
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:57,591
to that.

34
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:59,250
And that was,
uh,

35
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,080
not only in the universities but also 
politically,

36
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:06,081
but,
and that was both the adoption of 

37
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:09,681
responsibility instead of the incredible
and constant stress that's being placed 

38
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:14,331
on rights and also the responsibility of
the citizen to speak forward what he or 

39
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:20,301
she believed to be true or at least to 
not speak what they knew to be false,

40
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:26,271
which is at least a good place to start.
And one of the things I found so 

41
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,440
remarkable was that this was actually a 
salable message to young people.

42
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,830
And that surprised me because you know,
you wouldn't necessarily think that you 

43
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,151
would turn a lot of lights on in a young
audience by talking to people about 

44
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:38,820
truth and responsibility.
I think if you,

45
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,310
if you went to a marketing agency and 
told them that that was going to be your

46
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,870
political message to young people,
they would tell you to go back and,

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,600
you know,
flesh out another plan,

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,750
sketch out another plan.
But maybe young people have been talked 

49
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,100
to enough about rights for maybe about 
the next 15 decades.

50
00:02:56,101 --> 00:03:01,101
That's what I would think.
And so maybe there's a hunger a among 

51
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:04,330
young people for something that has a 
little bit more respectability,

52
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:09,331
let's say,
a little bit more depth than the 

53
00:03:09,331 --> 00:03:09,331
constant emphasis on,
on

54
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,740
doing whatever you want,
whenever you want.

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,260
Let's let's put it that way.
The thing about that,

56
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:20,261
and the thing about rights in general,
the idea of rights is that rights don't 

57
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:20,840
really give you much direction,
right?

58
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,300
They,
they,

59
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,900
they tell you what you are in principal 
allowed to do,

60
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,700
but they don't really tell you what you 
should do.

61
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:30,701
And it actually turns out that you need 
to know what you should do because you 

62
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,611
need to do something right.
People are active and our lives don't 

63
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:33,970
have any meeting without something to do
and,

64
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,950
and something that you should do.
It can't just be something that you want

65
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,650
to do that's too shallow.
There's no deep meaning.

66
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:42,110
There's no enduring,
there's no sustaining meaning in that.

67
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,280
It's just impulsiveness and,
and the.

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,010
And maybe that's okay.
In some sense,

69
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:51,011
maybe that's entertaining and maybe it's
and maybe it's impulsively exciting and 

70
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,240
fun and there's some,
there's some utility in that for life.

71
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,040
But life is a very difficult journey,
let's say it involves a lot of suffering

72
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:02,810
and it involves a lot of,
of heavy existential weight and you need

73
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:07,811
to be able to put something,
a value up against that so that you can 

74
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:11,180
withstand your life and you can stand up
with some dignity and you can contribute

75
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:13,910
to your community and you can feel that 
you're a worthwhile person,

76
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,610
you know,
in spite of all the things that are,

77
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,820
that you're doing wrong and in spite of 
all the problems that you have.

78
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:24,821
And so then people need to know what 
they should do and one of the things 

79
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:27,941
they should do is take responsibility.
And another thing they should do is try 

80
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:30,821
to tell the truth because those two 
things help them live proper lives and 

81
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,410
then help society organizes itself 
properly.

82
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,000
And that's,
that's good,

83
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,500
that's good for everyone.
So,

84
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,190
and so it turns out that when you tell 
young people that they're pretty damn 

85
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,031
happy about that.
And so one of the things I thought I 

86
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:48,611
would do tonight is talk about what 
conservatives might have to offer to 

87
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,920
young people as a saleable message.
You know,

88
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,950
because my,
the other thing I've learned over the 

89
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,950
last year,
and this was quite

90
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,830
revealing,
let's put it that way.

91
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,700
I'll start with a brief story just as a 
little intro to this.

92
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,150
In the last three weeks,
some of you may know that there was 

93
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,571
quite a political storm that emerged 
particularly among journalists over the 

94
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:17,011
issue of cultural appropriation.
A number of journalists got in real 

95
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:20,761
trouble for transgressing the 
politically correct norms in 

96
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:23,940
relationship to cultural appropriation,
a tremendously ill defined,

97
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:27,520
and let's call it pathological concept.
We could start with that,

98
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,680
but.
But the thing that was so interesting 

99
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,330
and I think I probably talked to 10 of 
Canada's top 20 journalists.

100
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,910
That would be a reasonable estimate.
Most of them in print,

101
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:41,911
but not all of them.
Every single one of them told me that 

102
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:44,020
they were censoring themselves.
Or you think about that man,

103
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:46,870
that's no joke.
In a country like this and these people,

104
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:47,380
you think,
well,

105
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,120
if anyone has power,
they have power.

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,630
It's like,
well,

107
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:54,631
they don't really have power.
They have competence and influence and 

108
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:57,391
that's not the same thing as power and 
they're bloody afraid of being hung out 

109
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:00,751
to dry if they say the wrong thing.
You think about where our damn country 

110
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:01,520
is.
When the 10 most powerful journalists in

111
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:04,550
the country are afraid to write and say 
what they think,

112
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,110
that's not a good thing,
man.

113
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:11,290
That's not a good thing.
I don't care what it is that they want 

114
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,470
to say or think the fact that they're 
not only did they tell me that they were

115
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:17,471
censoring themselves and that they felt 
that they would be hung out to dry if 

116
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:20,741
they said the wrong thing,
but they also told me that they were 

117
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:21,080
being censored by their editors and so 
you know,

118
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,470
in a country that has a great tradition 
and a tradition that's much longer than 

119
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:33,290
this country has been around of freedom 
and free speech and free press.

120
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,420
For us to be in this situation now where
our major journalists are afraid that if

121
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:43,421
they misstep inappropriately in this new
found political landmine that they're 

122
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,610
going to be done.
That is not good.

123
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,730
Right?
That's a bad diagnostic sign.

124
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,450
Okay.
Well,

125
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:55,451
I said that story was a little intro to 
the other story was going to tell you 

126
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:58,720
and then so I've been fortunate enough 
over the last several months to meet not

127
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,260
the majority of the people who ran for 
the leadership of the Federal 

128
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:05,450
Conservative Party,
but most of them,

129
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,600
including the people,
the person who Andrew,

130
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:13,190
who recently won and uh,
they all told me the same thing,

131
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,220
which was also interesting was that the 
conservatives were afraid to be 

132
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,920
conservative and if for exactly the same
reason,

133
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:23,921
they were afraid that if they put 
forward valid conservative perspectives 

134
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,290
that they would be isolated and mobbed 
and taken down and,

135
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,290
and that made them censor themselves and
not be willing to speak up.

136
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,530
And I thought,
and I told each of them when we 

137
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,571
discussed this,
the same thing was if you guys are 

138
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:40,571
afraid to talk,
you've already lost.

139
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:42,230
You might as well just pack up and go 
home.

140
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,300
It's done now,
you know,

141
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,380
as a psychologist.

142
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,060
Thank you.
Fuck,

143
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,020
I got to say,
I'm not making a case for conservatism.

144
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:56,480
I'm not here to make a political case.
Right?

145
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I'm here to make a philosophical and 
psychological case and I think that's 

146
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,570
what I've been doing all along.
It has political implications,

147
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,960
so I'm not saying that you should be 
conservative or that conservative is the

148
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:10,961
only way to be because I actually don't 
believe that for for a variety of 

149
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:14,201
reasons.
One of the reasons is that I know that 

150
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:18,310
political belief is determined in large 
part by temperament and personality and 

151
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,751
that's very strongly biologically 
influenced and so conservatives tend to 

152
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:25,811
be lower and openness,
which is a trait associated with 

153
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:28,811
creativity and hiring conscientiousness,
which is a trait associated with 

154
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:32,740
industriousness and orderliness.
They tend to make good managers and 

155
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,831
administrators and lawyers.
They tend to make good conservative 

156
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:35,831
business types.
That's,

157
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:40,270
that's their forte,
that's their niche and that's a valid 

158
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,690
place to be in a valid thing to be and 
you know,

159
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,930
conservatives aren't so good at being 
entrepreneurial and they're not so good 

160
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:46,930
at being artistic and creative.

161
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,830
That's not their niche.
That's more the niche of the liberal end

162
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:50,720
of the spectrum and as far as I'm 
concerned,

163
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:53,120
for the political system to function 
properly,

164
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,150
you need proper representation for all 
the temperamental types and they need to

165
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,130
be engaged in dialogue.
So.

166
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,830
But the thing is is that when the 
conservatives are saying,

167
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,700
well,
you know,

168
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,690
especially when they're perhaps thinking
about leading the damn party,

169
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,780
let's say that they're worried about 
speaking their mind in a conservative 

170
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,770
manner.
That's just not a good thing.

171
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:18,771
That means that something's gone wrong 
with our political system and seriously 

172
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:18,771
wrong.
You know,

173
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:18,771
when.
The other thing that.

174
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,770
Another thing that I've noticed it 
thing,

175
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,780
you know,
when,

176
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,840
when this all.
Some of you may know in some of you may 

177
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,800
not know that I made a couple of videos 
back September 27th.

178
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,190
I woke up one night because I couldn't 
sleep and I thought,

179
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,750
are you usually going right if I can't 
sleep because I've got something to 

180
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,750
figure out.

181
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,750
But I've been playing with youtube 
videos.

182
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,411
I've been putting my lectures online 
since 2013 and by last April they had 

183
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:43,500
about a million views.
And so I thought,

184
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,080
wow,
that's,

185
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,900
that's really something,
man,

186
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,130
you know,
like you write a book and you sell a 

187
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:51,130
million copies,
you're one happy character.

188
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,000
And I thought a million views is a very 
large number of views.

189
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:59,001
It really tuned me into the fact that 
youtube was something completely other 

190
00:09:59,001 --> 00:09:59,001
than what I thought it was.
But anyways,

191
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,690
that night I thought,
oh,

192
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,650
I'll get up,
I'll make a video instead of writing it 

193
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,961
down.
And this was a video about bill 

194
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:08,961
[inaudible],
which by the way,

195
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:09,540
the Senate just passed,
right?

196
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,630
Half the conservatives voted for it,
despite the fact that the justice 

197
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,501
minister was presented with an amendment
that clearly indicated that bill see 16 

198
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:22,200
would not infringe upon free speech and 
refused to consider the amendment.

199
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,130
So that's where we are.
There's compelled speech is now.

200
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:31,131
The law in Canada isn't yet,
but it's going to be very soon and half 

201
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:31,650
the conservatives voted for that damn 
bill.

202
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,060
And I can tell you to,
you know,

203
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:35,240
people have gotten after me for being,
you know,

204
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,250
anti transgender and bigoted and phobic 
and all that nonsense that the left 

205
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,120
tends to hurl at people.
It's not the case.

206
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:47,121
I read that damn legislation and I read 
the policies surrounding it and I knew 

207
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:49,530
perfectly well that the way it's 
formulated right now,

208
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,860
it will do more harm to the people that 
purports to protect then good.

209
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:58,010
That'll take about 10 years to unfold,
but it's so incoherent and the the the 

210
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,940
principles upon which that legislation 
and it's surrounding policies are based,

211
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:07,941
are so paradoxical and contradictory 
that they will act themselves out 

212
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:12,320
because that's what happens with 
paradoxical beliefs and tangled people 

213
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,591
up like the men that tight tangle people
up in them like mad and we'll see that 

214
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:21,711
happen over the next decade and it's 
partly because the people who put bill 

215
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:25,100
60 [inaudible] forward,
especially with regards to its 

216
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,100
surrounding policies.

217
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,870
The ones that are detailed out on the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission website 

218
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,540
don't give a damn about transgendered 
people.

219
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:35,541
As far as I'm concerned there.
There's another agenda at work that's 

220
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,710
driving their entire political force 
forward and the transgender types.

221
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:39,390
We're just flavor of the month,
right?

222
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:44,391
They were poster boys for moving this 
postmodern agenda forward and so the 

223
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:48,951
fact that the legislation isn't going to
do them any good during the 

224
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:52,791
transgendered people any good isn't 
going to stop the people who put the 

225
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:52,791
legislation forward.
So anyways,

226
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,530
I made these videos and I put them on a,
on youtube and well to say that they 

227
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,440
caused a storm,
which is somewhat of an understatement.

228
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:03,700
I mean it's just been.
I just,

229
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,820
I,
I don't even know what to think about.

230
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,050
It's completely and absolutely surreal 
what,

231
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:12,370
what's happened to me like as a 
consequence of that,

232
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:15,010
I mean I don't know how many people have
watched those original videos,

233
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:19,750
like $350,000.
I think now about 50 million people have

234
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:23,680
watched videos associated with this 
sequence of events that I'm describing,

235
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:28,681
which is just 350,000
people watched the testimony that I gave

236
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:33,400
before the Senate on bill [inaudible].
You bloody well know that the apocalypse

237
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:37,990
is close when 350,000
people around the world watch a Canadian

238
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,630
Senate hearing.
So I really,

239
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,910
I mean really what's going on man?

240
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,220
So anyways,
you know,

241
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:50,970
so,
you know,

242
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:55,971
I said,
well the journalists are nervous and 

243
00:12:55,971 --> 00:12:55,971
the,
and the,

244
00:12:55,971 --> 00:12:55,971
and the,
the part where they're conservatives are

245
00:12:55,971 --> 00:12:57,830
nervous and,
and uh,

246
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,860
well then,
you know,

247
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:03,861
when I,
when I put myself out and made these 

248
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:06,801
videos,
which are really didn't expect to 

249
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:08,751
attract much attention at all,
I just assumed that I was going to 

250
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:08,751
clarify what I was thinking a little bit
and you know,

251
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:13,020
to see what happened.
I kind of a curious person now that'll 

252
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,770
teach me but I'm kind of a curious 
person.

253
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:15,360
And so,
um,

254
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,200
but then,
you know,

255
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:19,170
I also experienced firsthand what 
happens when you do something like that.

256
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:23,430
Now I got nailed right.
I got especially for about three months,

257
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:28,431
things were pretty up in the air at the 
university sent me two letters telling 

258
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:30,390
me that it was so funny because I've 
made this video and I said,

259
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,400
you know,
under this new legislation,

260
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:36,090
making this video,
criticizing this legislation is probably

261
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,720
illegal.

262
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,050
And so then the unit and people of 
course reacted to me as if I was 

263
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,230
scaremongering,
which by the way was the right response.

264
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:46,230
When you hear someone in a stable 
society stand up and say,

265
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:48,050
excuse me,
there's a,

266
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,070
there's something rotten at the base 
here,

267
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,190
and it's affecting the manner in which 
the legislation that our country is 

268
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,190
producing is,
is,

269
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,480
is being rolled fourth,
when they say that you should think that

270
00:13:57,481 --> 00:14:01,110
person is probably a charlatan and has 
something wrong with them because look,

271
00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:06,111
the culture works pretty good.
The has worked really well for a long 

272
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,811
period of time,
and so the logical initial response 

273
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:08,811
should be,
yeah,

274
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:12,621
you think there's a fundamental problem,
why shouldn't we just assume that 

275
00:14:12,621 --> 00:14:15,231
there's a fundamental problem with you?
And one of the ways that you determined 

276
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:19,341
that is you throw things out the person 
metaphorically and see if any of them 

277
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:19,341
stick,
right?

278
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,010
So,
you know,

279
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:23,910
I was a big homophobic and transphobic 
and a racist.

280
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:28,911
That one,
I don't know where the hell that one 

281
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:28,911
came from.
I think it was because I,

282
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:28,911
I,
I criticize the two.

283
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,940
Uh,
what would you call reprehensible women 

284
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,830
who started black lives,
black lives matter movement,

285
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:36,300
Toronto.
It isn't because they're black.

286
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:38,520
It's because they're reprehensible,
black or white.

287
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:40,080
Man.
If you're reprehensible,

288
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:45,170
your reprehensible,
that's sort of the definition of not 

289
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:45,170
being racist.
Right.

290
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:45,170
So

291
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,900
anyways,
so,

292
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,440
so,
so there were a couple of demonstrations

293
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,750
and then the press jumped on me to some 
degree.

294
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,920
They didn't do too bad a job I didn't 
think and then the university thankfully

295
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:08,921
wrote two letters saying that what I was
doing was probably illegal and that it 

296
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:12,731
violated the,
the Ontario Human Rights Commission's 

297
00:15:12,731 --> 00:15:15,971
policies and probably the university's 
policies as well as far as they were 

298
00:15:15,971 --> 00:15:19,571
concerned,
which really wasn't the case and the 

299
00:15:19,571 --> 00:15:20,330
letters also contained a number of 
untruths which I detailed because I read

300
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:25,331
them on Youtube too,
which is actually quite helpful and 

301
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:28,391
handy that you know,
if someone writes me a letter that 

302
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:30,890
purports to lay out a set of facts,
then I can just read it.

303
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:35,891
I don't even have to comment on it.
I can read it and let people make up 

304
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:35,891
their own minds,
which they did so,

305
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,430
so well.
And so my job was in,

306
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,330
in,
in,

307
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,060
in doubt.

308
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,300
But the fact that the university went 
after me actually turned out to be 

309
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,300
extremely helpful.
Right.

310
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,051
Because I had said,
look under the provisions of this new 

311
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:51,950
legislation and legislation like this 
that's already in place in Canada,

312
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,940
what I am doing criticizing this bill is
probably illegal.

313
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,990
And everyone said,
no,

314
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:58,330
you're crazy.
You know you're,

315
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,570
there's something wrong with you.
You're a,

316
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,280
you're a,
you're a scaremonger.

317
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:06,281
And a rabble rouser and all of that.
And then the university wrote a letter 

318
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:07,640
saying what you did violated the,
you know,

319
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,820
the university policy and probably the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission's 

320
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:12,820
policies and the law.
And I thought,

321
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,810
great,
you had your lawyers take a look at it.

322
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,420
I couldn't have asked for a more 
stronger statement,

323
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:20,450
a stronger statement in support of what 
I had said,

324
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
especially because it certainly wasn't 
written in support of what I had set.

325
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,960
So,
and then the journalist started to pay 

326
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:28,960
attention to what I had actually looked 
at and they read it and they thought,

327
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,010
Oh hey,
look at that.

328
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:35,011
That don't that ordinary human rights 
commission website policy mass is 

329
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:36,260
actually quite a nest of spiders.
Just like he said.
