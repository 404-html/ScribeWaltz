1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,570
There was a cat that they recently 
discovered,

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:08,571
a prehistoric cat that had this bottom 
single tooth and they found out that if 

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,620
a human skull fit right inside its mouth
and so it could grab you here and Pierce

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,790
the back of your skull with its,
with its single tooth and that's what it

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,580
was evolved for.
So you know,

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,970
it's under such conditions we evolved 
and we're predators obviously,

7
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:31,530
but were tasty predators and so other 
things were perfectly happy to eat us.

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,740
And so when you're aware you don't know 
what to do,

9
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:41,741
you act like a prey animal and that's 
probably what you should do because 

10
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,480
maybe if you keep your head down and 
shut the hell up,

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,100
there will be any attention to attracted
to you and maybe you'll get through it.

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:54,510
You know,
you might decide unlikely to intervene 

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,740
and take the guy down,
but,

14
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,090
but you would be the exception rather 
than the norm.

15
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,370
And it's unsurprising.

16
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,510
Okay.
So what I came to understand was the 

17
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,131
belief systems regulated emotions,
but not exactly psychologically like it 

18
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,950
isn't exactly.
It isn't.

19
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:27,951
Exactly.
And this is sort of like the terror 

20
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,871
management theories.
It's not exactly like you have a theory 

21
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:30,240
in your head and the theory explains the
world and because of the theory explains

22
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,880
the world.
The theory is what's making you secure.

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,900
It's kind of like that.
It's like you have a theory in your head

24
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,260
and the theory makes you feel secure 
because it explains the world,

25
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:45,261
but the reason that explains the world 
is because other people have the same 

26
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:46,440
theory in their head and then when you 
both act out the theory,

27
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,830
you both get what you want and it's the.
It's the coming together of the theory 

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,420
and the outcome that makes you.

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,430
It's life.
Not only does it stop you from being 

30
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,720
anxious and often make you happy because
you get what you want,

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,720
but it's not just psychological.
You know,

32
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:10,650
the fact that we do this,
that we cooperate within our societies.

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,050
We match our belief systems and then act
them out.

34
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,200
That's the predicate for a productive 
society.

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,650
So it's actually,
it isn't just that it saves,

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,840
saves you from death,
anxiety,

37
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,630
like the terror management theorists 
have it.

38
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:28,110
It's,
it saves you from death and that's good.

39
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:30,060
I mean,
being protected from death,

40
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:31,560
anxiety,
oh good,

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,910
that's great too,
man,

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,150
but actually not dying.
That's sort of the fundamental thing 

43
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,211
that you're after,
and so people have reason to defend 

44
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,810
their territory.
If you think of territory that way,

45
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,820
as you think about it as a domain where 
the fundamental presuppositions of each 

46
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,200
citizen are matched by the behavior of 
their coast citizens,

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,460
they have every reason to defend that,
and if it falls apart,

48
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,940
it can have mortally serious 
consequences.

49
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:02,320
It's chaos,
you know,

50
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,320
and that chaos doesn't just destabilize 
everybody.

51
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,140
Psychologically,
it destabilizes everything.

52
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:11,020
It can destabilize.
The currency can be stabilized,

53
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,460
the industrial economy.
It can,

54
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,910
the lights can go off.
It's like it's not good,

55
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,050
so hey,
no wonder people protect it.

56
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,310
So then I started thinking about what a 
belief system was and I realized that a 

57
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,900
belief system was actually a set of 
moral guidelines

58
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,200
and moral guidelines are guidelines 
about how you should behave.

59
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,740
Also,
how you should perceive and the reason 

60
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,801
that a moral guideline is necessary for 
you to perceive is that you can't look 

61
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:55,740
at anything without a hierarchy of 
value.

62
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,430
Right?
Think about it like how many things in 

63
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,970
this room could you look out?
There's an in innumerable things in this

64
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:05,730
room to look at.
There's just all this squares,

65
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:10,731
the little tiny squares in this fabric.
You could look at those things for til 

66
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:11,370
the end of time,
one at a time,

67
00:04:11,371 --> 00:04:13,710
but you don't do that.
In fact,

68
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:18,711
if I took most of you out of this room,
there's a very low probability that 

69
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:23,001
you'll be.
You'd be able to tell me what color the 

70
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,100
walls were or even if those things were 
on the walls and the reason for that is 

71
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:30,480
that who cares?
As long as the walls don't move,

72
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,870
colors irrelevant and there's no reason 
for you to remember it.

73
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,830
It has no emotional significance.
It has no value,

74
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,070
and so what you do instead is,
well,

75
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,100
this is what you're doing,
so why are you here?

76
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,120
I don't mean in the broad metaphysical 
sense.

77
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,550
I mean specifically why are you here 
right now?

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,050
And I would say,
well,

79
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:56,640
you're a students obviously and you're 
trying to get a degree and you know,

80
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:59,430
you believe that that will have some 
functional utility.

81
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,480
Maybe you'll be a little wiser and a 
little more literate and a little and be

82
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:08,481
able to think a little better and be 
able to write a little better and so 

83
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:08,481
you'll actually be more functional in 
the world.

84
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,710
That would be good.
You know,

85
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,080
and and maybe you're interested in,
but anyways,

86
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:18,081
it's.
You're in this particular lecture so 

87
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:21,570
that you can take this particular class 
so that you can get a particular kind of

88
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:26,571
degree so that you can launch your life 
and then in your life you're probably 

89
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:30,561
going to meet someone that you have a 
longterm relationship with and you're 

90
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:33,120
going to have children and you're going 
to partake in the society and that's why

91
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:33,600
you're here.

92
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,740
All of those reasons simultaneously is 
why you're here.

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,310
And so then that helps you decide what 
to look at.

94
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,880
And so what you look at is at the moment
or listened to is me because in 

95
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:53,001
principle,
I'm the gateway to that set of 

96
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:57,741
accomplishments at this moment.
And so you focus on me and that's 

97
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:03,680
because you value that.
And so what that means is you can't even

98
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,630
look at the world without a value 
structure.

99
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,920
You know,
it's chaos if everything is equally 

100
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:11,920
unimportant or if everything is equally 
important.

101
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,530
It's chaos.
And so value system structures the very 

102
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,480
way that you perceive the world.
And I don't mean that metaphysically.

103
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:25,481
There's plenty of experiments that have 
demonstrated that the invisible gorilla 

104
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:25,481
experiment,
which,

105
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:27,800
how many of you knew about the invisible
gorilla experiment,

106
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,640
how many don't?

107
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,830
Well,

108
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:39,010
roughly speaking,
what happens is that there are two 

109
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,041
teams,
a white team dressed dressed in white 

110
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,010
and the team dressed in black and 
there's video of them and the black team

111
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:48,011
is passing the basketball back and forth
and the white team is passing the 

112
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:48,920
basketball back and forth.
And you're supposed to count the Times.

113
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:51,290
The basket ball gets passed back and 
forth.

114
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,900
There's only one basketball.
And so you know,

115
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,970
you're diligent for whatever reason you 
do what the experiment or asks you and 

116
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,780
you count the basketball tosses and you 
think,

117
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,060
well that's not so hard.
It's like 16.

118
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,620
So you tell them 16 and they say,
did you see the gorilla?

119
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,830
And half of you say,
what,

120
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,770
what are you talking about?
And the experimenter says,

121
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,730
well,
let's watch again,

122
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:20,210
but this time don't count all.
Sure enough,

123
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,670
like 30 seconds into the video.
And you know,

124
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,620
the players fill the video screen.

125
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,840
It's not like they're 300 yards in the 
distance,

126
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:31,841
you know,
like little ants playing basketball 

127
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:31,841
there,
right?

128
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:32,180
Filling the screen,
you can see their faces.

129
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,410
Sure enough a minute into the video.
This guy in a gorilla suit and he's not 

130
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,970
little and neither is the gorilla suit.
He comes out,

131
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,420
bangs his chest right in the middle of 
the screen for five seconds and then 

132
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,250
disappears and half more than half 
actually,

133
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,740
if people don't see that and it's even 
worse down.

134
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:56,090
Simon did another experiment where 
you're at a counter,

135
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,240
you know,
at a store and there's a clerk there and

136
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,990
you're talking to the clerk and the 
clerk goes down hypothetically to get 

137
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:10,331
something in.
A different clerk pops up and you'd 

138
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:10,331
think,
Hey,

139
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:11,060
I noticed that,
but you don't.

140
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,110
And you can even vary the clerk quite a 
bit and people don't notice.

141
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,200
So we focus on very particular things.
And the reason we don't notice this 

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,090
because it actually doesn't matter in 
terms of the ongoing,

143
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,720
our ongoing action at that point,
the clerk is interchangeable as long as 

144
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,930
the entity there acts like a clerk 
that's sufficient.

145
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,560
So belief system structure,
your perceptions,

146
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:55,890
value systems,
we're going to call them systems.

147
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,260
They structure your perceptions and they
also guide your actions because you act 

148
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,910
in accordance with your values,
conscious or unconscious.

149
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,240
You have values that you don't know 
about because you just don't know 

150
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,240
yourself very well.

151
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,600
The you can tell that,
that you have values that you don't know

152
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,550
very well because sometimes you get 
attracted to people that you know,

153
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,780
you know perfectly well,
that's a mistake.

154
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,380
Or you know,
you're trying to tell yourself to study 

155
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:27,380
and you don't.
And you know,

156
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,610
so there's,
you're not really in control of yourself

157
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,820
to any great degree.
Some and the more integrated you are,

158
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:34,440
the more control you have.
But you know,

159
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:39,441
you're kind of a loose collection of 
arguing subpersonalities and they're 

160
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,640
more or less directed towards a single 
goal.

161
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:43,860
But it depends on how committed you are 
to that goal.

162
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,160
How much you've thought it through,
how much you buy into it,

163
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,520
how many of the contradictions in your 
world representation you've managed to 

164
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,550
iron out and all of that.

165
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,060
So,

166
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,510
but in any case,
it's value systems that government 

167
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,170
action and perception.
