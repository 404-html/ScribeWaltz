1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,560
You know,
in,

2
00:00:00,561 --> 00:00:02,910
in the Hobbit,
for example,

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,380
when,
what's his name,

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,670
Frodo,
right,

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,760
isn't,
it's not Bilbo,

6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,120
Bilbo in Harvard,
you know,

7
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,280
he's kind of this little underdeveloped

8
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,150
overprotected shire dweller and he's 
called on a great adventure to go and 

9
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:24,841
find the dragon,
and he asked to become a thief in order 

10
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:26,650
to manage it.
Well,

11
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,000
that's pretty weird,
you know,

12
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:28,900
it's like,
well,

13
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:33,901
it's because as a good citizen,
he's just not enough to conquer a 

14
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:37,240
dragon.
He asked to also become a bad citizen in

15
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:42,241
some sense.
He has to incorporate the part of 

16
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:42,241
themselves that's monstrous,
let's say,

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,910
and develop that and hone it.
And,

18
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,280
and that's to say that,
well,

19
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,370
if you're harmless,
you're not virtuous,

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,030
you're just harmless.
You're like a rabbit.

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,470
Rabbit isn't virtuous.
It's just,

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,440
just can't do anything except get eaten.
It's not virtuous.

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,790
If you're a monster and you don't act 
monstrously,

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,360
then you're virtuous,
but you also have to be a monster while 

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,580
you see this all the time.
Harry Potter's like that too.

26
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,230
It's like he's,
he's flawed,

27
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:12,670
he's hurt.
He's got evil in him.

28
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:14,050
He can talk to snakes,
man,

29
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,380
he breaks rules all the time,
all the time.

30
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,000
He's not an obedient at all,
but you know,

31
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,020
he has a good reason for breaking the 
rules and if he couldn't break the 

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,711
rules,
him and his little clique of rule 

33
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:29,470
breaking troublemakers.
If they didn't break the rules,

34
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,940
they wouldn't attain the highest goal.
So it's very peculiar,

35
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:35,010
but it's very,
very.

36
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,980
It's a very,
very,

37
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:39,100
very,
very common mythological notion.

38
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,990
The hero has to be,

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,150
the hero has to be a monster,
but a controlled monster.

40
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:48,520
Batman is like that,
you know,

41
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,550
I mean it's,
it's everywhere.

42
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:54,551
It's the story you always hear meaning 
we have to be more precise.

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,650
Well,
that's a good,

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,380
that's a good question because one 
question is,

45
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,020
you know,
you're kind of implicitly moral insofar 

46
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,020
as you're socialized,
but that's sort of procedural.

47
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:16,060
It's just built into you.
This is different.

48
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:21,061
This is also becoming conscious of it 
and expanding out your personality into 

49
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:22,270
dimensions that it wouldn't normally 
occupy.

50
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:26,530
So this happens to people all the time.
So for example,

51
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,710
lots of my clients,
my clinical clients are too agreeable 

52
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,830
and I'm,
they're generally women because women 

53
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,531
are more agreeable than men,
but not always because I've had 

54
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:37,531
agreeable man,
his clients as well.

55
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:41,970
And what happens is they,
they're resentful and they don't know 

56
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,061
how to stand up for themselves and it's 
because they're very compassionate by 

57
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:48,451
nature.
And so if you're entering into a 

58
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:48,451
negotiation with them,
they'll let you win.

59
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,610
Well,
that's not so good because you know you 

60
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:53,610
need to win too.

61
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,450
Especially if you're in an organization 
of adults where there's,

62
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,930
there's a struggle,
right?

63
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,660
When you have kids can let them win.
Especially infants.

64
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Like you have to let them win.
And that's partly why compassion is so 

65
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,450
necessary.
But as a,

66
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,260
as a basis for negotiation between 
adults,

67
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:12,670
it's like,
sorry,

68
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,440
it's insufficient.
You have to.

69
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,830
You have to be a bit of a monster so 
that you can say no.

70
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,220
And so a lot of what you do in 
psychotherapy is treat people's anxiety 

71
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,130
and depression.
That's a huge chunk of it.

72
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,290
Help them straighten out the way they 
think.

73
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,420
That's a huge chunk of it,
but another chunk of it is,

74
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,460
well,
let's toughen you up.

75
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,610
You know,
let's put you in a position where you 

76
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,231
can bargain,
let's teach you how to assert yourself 

77
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:40,171
and stand up for yourself and that's 
assertiveness training and it's a huge 

78
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:40,630
chunk of psychotherapy and you need to.

79
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,690
You need to learn it.
It's like because part of how you 

80
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,371
regulate your interactions with other 
people is to negotiate and you cannot 

81
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:53,410
negotiate unless you can say no,
you can't do it.

82
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,980
And its causes conflict to say no,
and if you don't like conflict,

83
00:03:56,981 --> 00:03:59,320
which is basically the definition of 
being agreeable,

84
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,500
then you can't tolerate the conflict and
so then you can't negotiate on your own 

85
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,050
behalf and so then you keep losing and 
you're bullied and you know it's,

86
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,210
it's not good.
Then you get resentful and,

87
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:14,211
and it's really not good.
So you have to develop your inner 

88
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:18,310
monster a little bit and,
and then that makes you a better person,

89
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,170
not a worse person.
It's weird,

90
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,900
it's weird,
but,

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,040
but that's just how it is.
Outside of that diagram is chaos itself,

92
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:36,390
and that's the chaos from which things 
emerge.

93
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:41,391
Now,
I can't tell you much about that yet 

94
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:43,671
because it's too damn complicated,
but I think the best way to think about 

95
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:45,780
chaos is as potential.
That's one way of thinking about it.

96
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,080
It's also that place you end up when you
don't know what to do.

97
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,060
It's the source of all things,
but it's also the terrible Predator,

98
00:04:56,061 --> 00:05:00,170
the terrible eternal Predator that lurks
beyond the explored domain.

99
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,770
It's a winged dragon and it's winged.
Who knows why matter and spirit.

100
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:08,330
That's partly what it is,
and I'll explain that later.

101
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,480
It's also potentially the predatory 
beast that's been after us for for 

102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,930
forever and the winged Predator that 
picked us up from the sky.

103
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,790
So primates,
for example,

104
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:23,780
monkeys have some monkeys have three 
specialized alarm cries,

105
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:28,700
one is for snakes,
and that usually means hit the trees and

106
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:33,701
then one's for leopards and that means 
hit the trees and go out on a skinny 

107
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:33,701
branch because the leopard can't get to 
you.

108
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,930
And then there's one for like birds of 
prey,

109
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:39,410
which means hide somewhere on the ground
so that you don't get picked off.

110
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:40,850
And it's like,
well,

111
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,090
that's what that is.
That's what that is.

112
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:50,050
And that's chaos and,
and it's expanded into much more than 

113
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,870
that.
And then I showed you,

114
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,820
I don't remember if I showed you this,
but this is,

115
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,900
this is a symbolic representation of 
mother,

116
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,200
father culture and the suffering 
individual,

117
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,400
but it's all that's all positive.
There's no negative elements there,

118
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,700
but that's okay.
That's a partial representation.

119
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,690
And those things are sacred in some 
sense because they are representative of

120
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:14,690
an ultimate reality of an ultimate 
reality.

121
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,440
This sacrificial individual hear the 
suffering individual.

122
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,650
Well,
that's pretty straightforward.

123
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,450
It's like that's what,
that's life,

124
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,850
that's suffering,
that's life,

125
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,470
that's what happens to the individual.
And so everyone is looking at that.

126
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,600
There's a,
it has power,

127
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,060
that idea.
Well,

128
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:40,061
it's because you know,
culture supports the suffering 

129
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:43,631
individual and cultures nested inside 
benevolent nature and that's part of the

130
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:48,821
story of the world.
And it's this part of the story we're 

131
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:48,821
trying to figure out and make 
articulate.

132
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:53,260
We've been doing that for thousands of 
years trying to make this story 

133
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,140
articulate and it's not yet articulate 
it.

134
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,370
It's only we're only getting it.
We're only getting it and we.

135
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,400
We basically do that now mostly with 
movies and stories and fiction and that 

136
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,810
sort of thing.
We still don't have it articulated.

137
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,050
I think young went close,
came closer than anyone else,

138
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:11,390
young and an Eric Norman who was one of 
his students,

139
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,690
came closer than anyone else ever has to
actually articulate that and that's what

140
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,410
you was trying to do is to take all 
these images,

141
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:21,650
archetypal images,
instinctual images and say,

142
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:22,490
well,
what do they mean?

143
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:24,020
What do they mean?
What do they mean?

144
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,350
And he got a long ways on that.
Although his writing is quite obscure 

145
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,411
and it's obscured because how the hell 
are you going to explain an image like 

146
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,140
that without being obscure?

147
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,910
It's like it's insanely complicated and 
it's not linear.

148
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,180
It's not a linear thing that that's why 
it's in a picture because a picture 

149
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,070
presents everything at once and you want
to take that apart linearly.

150
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,060
Jesus,
it's just,

151
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,300
it's just impossible,
but we've been struggling to do that.

152
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:55,301
Really.
We've been struggling to do that from 

153
00:07:55,301 --> 00:07:55,430
the time we became self conscious,
you know,

154
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,580
what is the world about?
How should we live in it?

155
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:04,150
While that's a partial answer,
and it's a culture bound answer 

156
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,391
obviously,
but you see archetipal representations 

157
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:08,570
like this and many cultures,
so for example,

158
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:13,220
the image of the Virgin and child that 
way predates Christianity.

159
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,700
Like the Egyptians,
that was isis and horace that goes back.

160
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,270
We have no idea how far thousands and 
thousands of years before the emergence 

161
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,191
of Judaism and Christianity way back 
before that and no doubt back into 

162
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:32,711
prehistory itself because a culture that
doesn't hold the mother and child as 

163
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:39,341
sacred dies obviously because obviously 
so it has to be held as a.

164
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,140
It has to be held as something that you 
revere,

165
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,230
which at least means you don't kill 
mothers and children and at least means 

166
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,950
that.
And that's an instinct.

167
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,130
You know,
it's an instinct.

168
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:59,550
It violates you to do that.
And thank God.

169
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,080
All right,
let's take 15 minutes.

170
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,010
So I told you about this a little bit 
last week,

171
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:16,011
but you know,
one of the motivations I had for 

172
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:18,710
thinking the things that I've thought 
through the motivation I had for 

173
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,001
thinking them through was because,
well I like it,

174
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,140
it,
it,

175
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,060
it seemed self evident to me,
let's say.

176
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,390
And I think that was partly from reading
young but not.

177
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,620
But that just helped me clarify it was 
that it was sort of young's contention 

178
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:40,671
that we had an organic development of a 
metaphysical ethic that was embedded in,

179
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,300
in religious tradition and that 
basically unfolded,

180
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:51,450
let's say in the West until about 1600,
1500,

181
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,230
something like that.

182
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,230
And then science emerged and we got 
unbelievably technologically powerful on

183
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,500
and using a certain view of the world.
You know,

184
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,590
we're so technologically powerful but 
we're still not very wise and that just 

185
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:10,980
seems to me to be a bad combination.
And I thought about that a lot.

186
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,670
It's like,
okay,

187
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:16,671
well how do you handle the combination 
of exceptional technological power and 

188
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:20,910
and an impaired ethic,
let's say something like that 

189
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,021
underdeveloped ethic or one even in 
which you have no faith because you 

190
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:27,981
know,
it seems that the foundational elements 

191
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:28,890
of it are irrational.
They're there in mythology,

192
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:33,891
there in religion,
they don't fit well with the scientific 

193
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:34,680
worldview.
How do you rectify that problem?

194
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,470
And while that's a tough problem,
you know,

195
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,070
it's a crazy problem and certainly it 
was the problem that young was trying to

196
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:42,600
address.
There's no doubt about it.

197
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,680
And along with that went an associated 
problem which,

198
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:46,690
which was,
you know,

199
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,710
what happened in the 20th century,
which was so awful and in so many 

200
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:56,421
places,
it was just so unbelievably brutal and 

201
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:59,541
terrible and it was perpetrated by 
millions of people and they were 

202
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:02,910
individual people and they weren't that 
much different from normal people.

203
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,530
In fact,
they were normal people.

204
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:08,460
And so the other thing that struck me 
was that it would be better if that sort

205
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:13,461
of thing didn't happen anymore.
And so I was trying to figure out what 

206
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:13,500
the hell could possibly be done about 
that.

207
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:16,110
And you know,
part of young's contention was while you

208
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:21,111
had to understand yourself as a monster,
if you were ever going to maintain some 

209
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:25,401
control over the fact that you are in 
fact the monster and that that could 

210
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:26,310
come forth if the situation is correct.
It's like,

211
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,370
okay,
that seems reasonable and so,

212
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,260
well it seemed to me that,
you know,

213
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:39,261
people had to become wiser and of course
that's a very difficult thing to figure 

214
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:42,240
out because you could even question 
whether there is such a thing as wisdom,

215
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,310
you know?
And,

216
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,160
and then I thought,
well that's what the universities are 

217
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,160
supposed to do.

218
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,740
Especially the humanities mostly in 
particular,

219
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:52,440
it's supposed to make you wise.
That's what it's for.

220
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,990
And it's doing a terrible job of that.
In my estimation.

221
00:11:55,991 --> 00:12:00,991
It's,
it's more decimating people as far as I 

222
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:03,661
can tell and undermining whatever ethic 
they have rather than making people 

223
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:06,070
wise.
And.

224
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,210
But I think that we have to become wise.
I don't think there's a choice.

225
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:15,211
I think it's a matter of survival and 
it's more than that because if you're 

226
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:18,541
wise in your own life,
you're going to have a way better life 

227
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,560
like incomparably better because you're.
You're gonna sleep soundly with a good 

228
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:27,301
conscience at night and you know people 
say that's worth more than money and 

229
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:31,050
that's worth more than money.
I know lots of people who have lots of 

230
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,110
money and let me tell you,
money protects you.

231
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,260
Your as well protected from the world by
money right now as you ever will be for 

232
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,260
the rest of your life.
