1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You know,
people say that's worth more than money 

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,921
and that's worth more than money.
I know lots of people who have lots of 

3
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:08,580
money and let me tell you,
money protects you,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,730
your as well protected from the world by
money right now as you ever will be for 

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,571
the rest of your life because there's 
most of life's fundamental problems 

6
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:18,660
can't be solved with money.
You know,

7
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,480
like rich people get divorced,
they have affairs,

8
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:26,481
their children get sick,
that they have all the problems you 

9
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:26,481
have,
and that's partly because you're already

10
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,870
rich and so

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,580
you might think that if you had a bunch 
of more money,

12
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:34,500
things would be better,
but it's just not true.

13
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:39,501
In fact,
in some ways that they might be worse 

14
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:41,130
because money can open up,
can open up the possibility of all sorts

15
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:43,950
of temptations to you that you just 
can't afford at the moment.

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,870
So well.
So like economic economics,

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,050
we've already solved that problem 
fundamentally and we're rapidly solving 

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:54,050
it everywhere in the world,
right?

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,641
I mean,
the world economy is growing so damn 

20
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,060
fast that you can't even imagine how you
could possibly make it grow any faster.

21
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:05,061
It's crazy.
We've lifted hundreds of millions of 

22
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:05,940
people out of poverty in the last 15 
years.

23
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,760
You know,
the UN set a goal by 2015,

24
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:12,660
I think it was to cut poverty by half if
I remember correctly.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,510
And they reached two years early.
You know,

26
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:17,460
it's like,
it's unbelievable.

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,060
So.

28
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:27,210
Well.
So then I started to try to understand 

29
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,270
what it might be to,
to live and,

30
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:33,271
and really what I was looking forward to
was not so much to live a life that was 

31
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:36,631
wise,
but at least to live a life that wasn't 

32
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:39,060
pathologically unwise.
And I thought of the sorts of things 

33
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:44,341
that people were doing to one another in
the Auschwitz camps and in the Gulag 

34
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,320
archipelago and all of that horror that 
was perpetrated on,

35
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,540
on people as definitely unwise.
Whatever else you might say about it was

36
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,980
unwise.
And so then I thought,

37
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,800
well maybe there's a way to figure out 
how you could not do that.

38
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,010
And so that's.
And I think that that's my sense is that

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,330
when you come to university to learn how
to be a civilized person,

40
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,640
which is what supposed to happen at 
university,

41
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,940
otherwise it's just a trade school and 
you might as well go to trade school as 

42
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,930
far as I'm concerned.
If you want to learn something that will

43
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:21,931
get you a job,
it's like it's a lot faster and it's 

44
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,190
more certain and,
and it's useful.

45
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,490
If you're not being taught to be a 
citizen at university,

46
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:27,850
then

47
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,790
why bother with it so?
Well.

48
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,290
So that's what we're trying to figure 
out.

49
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,690
And,
and that's part of that cloud of 

50
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,310
mythological fantasy that surrounds our 
culture.

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,370
That's part of its deep history that 
we're trying to,

52
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,770
you know,
if you grapple with the humanities and 

53
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:49,770
with art and all of that,
that you're trying to,

54
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,350
you're trying to master and incorporate 
and,

55
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,670
and,
and pull into you so that you're 

56
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,810
situated properly in history and,
and you're not just floating in the void

57
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,210
of,
of,

58
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:06,211
you know,
this tiny individuality that's divorced 

59
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:08,460
from everything else.
You're weak and that circumstance.

60
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,990
Right?
So

61
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,740
that's more of an explanation of why I'm
trying to puzzle through these things 

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,110
and trying to puzzle through them with 
you.

63
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,720
So anyways,
we talked about this,

64
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,350
this,
this song last week and you know,

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,140
I,
I made a hypothesis to you.

66
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,970
We'll,
we'll go through this quickly.

67
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,720
It's Doggerel.
It's not great poetry,

68
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:39,380
but it's irrelevant.
It was a very popular song.

69
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:44,381
It's quite beautiful in the movie.
It's actually sung by like a heavenly 

70
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:44,450
choir.
That's what it sounds like.

71
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:48,350
So it's got this cathedral.
You could imagine people singing it in a

72
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:50,990
cathedral essentially.
And so that's not accidental.

73
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,860
It's purposeful,
you know,

74
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:53,180
it,
it,

75
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,230
it partakes of that,
what would you call it?

76
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,140
It,
it partakes of that aesthetic,

77
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,280
that that's,
that's it.

78
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,560
So the,
the filmmakers are,

79
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,950
are implying that what is about to be 
shown to you has this divine element 

80
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,290
essentially,
and that that's signified by the choir 

81
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:17,510
of voices that sings this song.

82
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,630
And the song says fundamentally 
something like this is that if you lift 

83
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,450
up your eyes above the temporal,
into the transcendent,

84
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:34,451
and so that's what exists in the 
heavenly world in the stars.

85
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,530
If you pick a an ultimate goal,
if you pick the right ultimate goal,

86
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,070
then and you know anyone can do this.
That's the other thing.

87
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:44,410
It's democratic.
It's,

88
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,080
it's anyone can do this,
so that's,

89
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,680
that's the second proposition.
It doesn't matter who you are,

90
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,980
you can do this,
and so I think that's a reflection of 

91
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,110
the idea of the divinity of the 
individual.

92
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:57,920
It's like there's something about each 
individual that's valuable regardless of

93
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:02,390
their idiosyncrasies and so they have 
this potential that they can manifest.

94
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:03,650
And how do you manifest it?
Well,

95
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,200
you pick the right goal and what's the 
right goal?

96
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:06,530
Well,
it's,

97
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,690
it's high,
it's elevated,

98
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:10,310
it's above the mundane.

99
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,840
Now what does that mean?
Well,

100
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:13,880
you don't really know.
You don't really know.

101
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:18,110
That's why it's signified by a star and 
a star is something that glimmers in the

102
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,470
night,
right?

103
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,600
So it's a source of light in the 
darkness.

104
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,900
And so there's a metaphor there.
Obviously there's a metaphor there and 

105
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,030
the star is the star that the star of 
Hollywood,

106
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:34,031
you know the person that you emulate.
That's part of it because it's an ideal 

107
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:37,810
is it's going to be a human ideal,
some sort that you're aiming at and so 

108
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,950
the ideal human being is,
is the star that you're aiming at?

109
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,070
Maybe it's something like that.
If that's what you're aiming at,

110
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:43,880
you might say,
well,

111
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,150
what should you aim at in life?
And wanting to answer as well,

112
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,320
why don't you aim at being whatever you 
could be.

113
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:53,400
That would be the best.
No,

114
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,020
you don't know what that is exactly 
because how do you,

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,880
you know,
but you could think,

116
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:00,860
well that would be really good if I 
could have it.

117
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,420
And then you could say,
well,

118
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,670
can I think of anything better than 
that?

119
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,000
And if the answer is no,
then well why not go for that?

120
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,980
You know?
And you might say,

121
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:12,950
well it's too ambitious.
It takes too much responsibility.

122
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:13,490
It's like,
yeah,

123
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:13,990
yeah,
that,

124
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,210
those are definitely problems.
And one of the things that I've figured 

125
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,300
out over the years is that if you 
offered the person the opportunity,

126
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,410
you know,
because people say,

127
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:26,411
well,
life doesn't really have any ultimate 

128
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:26,411
meaning.
It's like,

129
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:26,411
yeah,
okay,

130
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:26,640
fine.
So far,

131
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,870
let's say it has an ultimate meaning,
but that in order to experience that 

132
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:37,991
ultimate meaning,
you have to take on ultimate 

133
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:38,630
responsibility for what you do.
Well,

134
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,240
that's a heavy price to pay,
to have a meaningful life,

135
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,710
you know,
and you might say,

136
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,740
well,
there's no damn way I'm going to do 

137
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:47,740
that.
I'll just go for the,

138
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:47,740
you know,
pointless.

139
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,040
Ah,

140
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,680
I'll go for that.
The trivial pointless perspective,

141
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,050
which you know,
was kind of hard on me existentially,

142
00:06:56,051 --> 00:06:58,810
but it frees me up.
I can do whatever the hell I want moment

143
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:03,811
to moment.
I don't have any ultimate 

144
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:03,811
responsibility.
And so then you think,

145
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:05,050
well that's kind of a good deal.
And then then.

146
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,360
But that raises this weird specter of 
doubt,

147
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:11,110
which is why when you hear people talk 
about the ultimate futility of life,

148
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,440
is it because life is ultimately futile?
Or is it because they've decided that 

149
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,510
they would just assume not adopt the 
responsibility and they use that real 

150
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:26,521
decision,
which is to not adopt the 

151
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,111
responsibility.
They rationalize that by proposing that 

152
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:30,670
life is ultimately meaningful,
meaningless and like,

153
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,850
you know,
I kind of by that I really do think 

154
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,120
that's what's going on so,
but maybe not,

155
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,500
but it could be that if you want to have
an ultimately meaningful life that you 

156
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,150
have to adopt ultimate responsibility.
Makes Sense.

157
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,610
What might that mean?
Well,

158
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:54,230
one thing it might mean is that,
and I do think it means this is it.

159
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,600
I think it was Alexander Pope,
but I might be wrong about that.

160
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:03,370
Who said nothing human is foreign to me 
and that's a hell of a statement,

161
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:08,371
right?
Because if you think about all the 

162
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:09,280
things that human beings are capable of,
they're capable of some,

163
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,370
like if you really want to know what 
people are capable of,

164
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:14,920
you should read about read about unit 
seven slash 31,

165
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,410
but I would not recommend it because if 
you read it,

166
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:20,290
you will never forget it and you will be
sorry that you read it,

167
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,040
but you'll know anyways to say that 
nothing human is foreign to you.

168
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:32,131
That's a hell of a thing to say because 
that means that what other people have 

169
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:36,181
done you could do,
and that also means you need to take 

170
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,350
responsibility for that.
That's no joke.

171
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,440
You know,
it's a big deal to do that and even 

172
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,790
trivial manner anyway,
so the idea is that you can elevate.

173
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,050
If you elevate your viewpoint to some 
transcendent ethic,

174
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,140
you want what's ultimately good.
You really want that.

175
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,170
Whatever that is you don't know,
but that's what you're even out says 

176
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:03,261
that,
well then it says this strange thing 

177
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:03,261
that,
well,

178
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:03,261
what you want,
we'll all of a sudden come to you.

179
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Well,
that's a proposition and it's the 

180
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,360
proposition that's basically played out 
in the movie.

181
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,920
It's a hypothesis.
The hypothesis is the best way to Orient

182
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:15,921
yourself in life is to orient yourself 
towards the highest good that you're 

183
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:19,131
capable of imagining and then aim at 
that and then things will work out the 

184
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:21,270
best way they can for you.
And I think,

185
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,860
I believe that's correct.
My,

186
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,480
my observation of life has led me to see
that that seems to be correct.

187
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,050
So for example,
you don't get something you don't aim at

188
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,500
that just doesn't work out and so lots 
of people are not thinking that's what 

189
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:36,500
they get.

190
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,160
So if you aim at something,
you have a reasonable crack at getting 

191
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,160
it,
you know,

192
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,330
you tend to change what you're aiming at
a bed along the way because like what 

193
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:44,330
are,
you know,

194
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:44,330
you know,
game there,

195
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,570
you're wrong,
but you get a little closer and then the

196
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:50,571
aim there and you're still wrong,
you get a little closer and the aim 

197
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:53,451
there and you know,
as you move towards what you're aiming 

198
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:53,451
at,
your,

199
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:56,760
your characterization of what to aim at 
becomes more and more sophisticated.

200
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,460
And so it doesn't really matter if 
you're wrong to begin with,

201
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:04,461
as long as you're smart enough to learn 
on the way and as long as you specify a 

202
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:08,211
goal.
So I specify a vague what I want things 

203
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:09,990
to be the best they could be and I'm 
willing to learn what best means as I go

204
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:11,070
along.
Okay?

205
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:16,071
So fine.
And then you get what you truly need 

206
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:16,071
will say,
well,

207
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:16,080
maybe not.
