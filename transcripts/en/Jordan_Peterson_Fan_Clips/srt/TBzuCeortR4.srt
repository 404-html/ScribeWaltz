1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:02,470
Now,
you know,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,760
it's a truism and probably an 
oversimplified one that since the dawn 

3
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:13,951
of the scientific revolution,
a wedge has been driven through the 

4
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:21,531
heart of our society such that the moral
systems that we use to Unitus,

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,640
so those would be religious systems 
fundamentally have been subject to an 

6
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:33,140
intense critique from the scientists and
you know,

7
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:36,650
it's a pretty effective critique even if
you have,

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,960
even if you've maintained a traditional 
faith,

9
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,440
it's like

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,660
you know,

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,520
the scientific onslaught is no joke and

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,360
that's a problem as far as I can tell 
because and the problem is that you're 

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,100
still left with the problem of how you 
should act.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,870
And Nietzsche,
the philosopher Nietzsche,

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,980
he would say that we're running on the 
fumes of Christianity in the West 

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,490
because over it's thousand years of 
domination to let's say,

17
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:13,491
1500 years of absolute domination.
It produced a consensus of morality that

18
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:20,031
was predicated on metaphysical 
presuppositions and that organized 

19
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:23,481
societies and those societies are 
predicated on certain beliefs like the 

20
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:29,001
belief.
And really I would say that something 

21
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:29,130
divined inhabits each individual.
You know,

22
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,530
that's sort of presumption that's 
embedded in law.

23
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:34,050
It's sort of the idea that underlies the
idea of natural,

24
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:34,620
right?
Right.

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,720
There's something about you that's so 
valuable that even the law has to bow to

26
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:42,030
it.
Even if you're reprehensible,

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,650
even if you're convicted and 
reprehensible now that's man,

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,960
the idea that people came up with that 
idea.

29
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:52,800
That's a bloody miracle.
It's because generally speaking,

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,150
your proclivity is if someone's been 
even accused of doing something,

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,240
that general human proclivity is that 
even if someone's just being accused of 

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,750
doing something terrible,
that's enough so that you can stone them

33
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,760
to death or do whatever you're going to 
do with them.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,150
Presumption of innocence before guilt,
good God,

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,740
of all the things that aren't automatic,
that's got to top the list.

36
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:14,110
You know,
it's.

37
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,250
It's unbelievable that that occurs,
and it's interesting to me because it 

38
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:20,580
seems to me that

39
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:27,490
that presupposition that there's 
something valuable transcendent about 

40
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,971
each individual.
I wouldn't call that a scientific 

41
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:35,041
presupposition,
but it seems to be a highly functional 

42
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:35,041
presupposition,
right?

43
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:39,930
I think in that it isn't unreasonable to
notice that societies that have

44
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,270
value the individual and made the law 
subject to the individual even with 

45
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:51,510
regards to voting because that's 
basically what voting does,

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,400
put sovereignty in the hands of the 
people.

47
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Those societies actually seemed to work.
Now whether they'll work for the next 

48
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,390
300 years.
Who the hell knows?

49
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:06,391
I don't know them,
but they've worked pretty well for the 

50
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:08,251
last 500 years let's say,
and we've got it pretty good right now 

51
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:13,000
and you know,
I suspect most of you are rather pleased

52
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,030
that the law recognizes your value as 
individuals and you take that for 

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,400
granted,
right?

54
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:22,240
You think you have rights and of course 
the rights that you have.

55
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:27,241
Natural rights are a logical consequence
of your transcendent value and that's 

56
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:35,521
nested in this niche niches observation 
that's nested in a set of metaphysical 

57
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:37,660
beliefs.
And his idea was that if you wipe out,

58
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:42,661
sorry,
you wipe out the metaphysical beliefs 

59
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:45,540
eventually wipe out the whole system 
because you've knocked out the 

60
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,271
cornerstone and it might take a long 
time for the thing to shake and fall.

61
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:53,851
But,
but it will now whether he was right or 

62
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,300
not,
it's hard to say.

63
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,800
It looks to me like what's happened 
since Nietzsche announced the death of 

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,181
God and say the late 18 hundreds is that
western society is oscillated between 

65
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,690
extremes,
extremes on the right Germany,

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,200
extremes on the left,
and you know,

67
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,480
with,
with the democracies,

68
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,780
at least the other democracies,
democracies managing to stay the course 

69
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,000
somewhere down the middle.
But,

70
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,630
but it's not obvious to me that that can
be maintained without the underlying 

71
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:38,731
metaphysics.
And that's a problem because whatever 

72
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,410
you might say about the underlying 
metaphysics,

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,360
it's not true the way science is true.
And that could be okay because there 

74
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,780
might be more than one form of truth.
In fact,

75
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,930
I think there is a.
I think there's pragmatic truth and I 

76
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,910
think pragmatic truth is actually deeper
than scientific truth.

77
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,450
And pragmatic truth is the truth that 
enable you to act in a manner that best.

78
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,790
It improves the probability roughly 
speaking of your existence and your 

79
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:14,540
reproduction maximally.
That's a Darwinian idea.

80
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:19,210
And one of the things about the 
Darwinian theory just kind of puts it in

81
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:21,580
opposition to scientific materialism,
I would say,

82
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:26,581
is that the Darwinian theory is that you
don't have privileged knowledge of the 

83
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:31,550
world and you can actually tell that 
because you die,

84
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,710
right?
If you knew enough about the world,

85
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:38,711
you wouldn't die and you do die,
and so you're an embodied theory of 

86
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:42,221
sorts,
and that theory is good enough to get 

87
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:44,561
you along about 80 years and produced 
some reasonable probability that you'll 

88
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,050
have children and that they all survive.
That's it,

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,080
man.
That's what you've managed after 3 

90
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,070
billion years of evolution.
It's a good enough,

91
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,680
it's a good enough way of acting and we 
don't know a better way of acting and 

92
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,070
our world conceptions are actually 
nested inside the Darwinian system and 

93
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,510
they might be predicated on pragmatic 
truths rather than objective truths.

94
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,260
Pragmatic truths are truths that have 
functional utility and we're alive.

95
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,600
We care about being alive.
We can to use our theories as tools.

96
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,870
It's possible that our theories are 
tools and that they're tools to help us 

97
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,870
stay alive.

98
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,410
Now I was reading a bit about Camille 
Paglia the other day and uh,

99
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,650
I've noticed some similarities between,
she's a famous gadfly,

100
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,560
I would say a feminists have classic 
modern feminists,

101
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:52,480
although she would regard yourself as a 
feminist,

102
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:58,170
unbelievably smart.
Like if you want to watch someone who's 

103
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,590
verbally who has verbal mastery beyond 
belief,

104
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,330
it's,
you could watch Camille Paglia.

105
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:05,080
She's,
she's,

106
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,110
she seems a little manic to me.
She can wrap off and argument at a rate 

107
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,290
that's just mind boggling and it's a 
very coherent and she tends to shred her

108
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,630
opponents and arguments.
He's so brilliant.

109
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,800
Um,

110
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:24,510
she said something interesting and she's
been influenced by some of the same 

111
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,021
people that I've been influenced by it.
She liked this book by Eric Norman 

112
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,470
called the origins and history of 
consciousness,

113
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:33,100
which I would recommend if you're 
interested in young Ian theory,

114
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,920
Carl Young.
It's a good introduction to union theory

115
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,100
and it's about the development of 
consciousness and it's predicated like 

116
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:48,190
young's work and Joseph Campbell's work 
and Murcia Elliot is work,

117
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,700
all of which has been criticized or 
ignored by the postmodernist,

118
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,820
predicated on id on the idea that human 
beings have a central narrative

119
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,390
and that

120
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,810
that central narrative is

121
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,160
the

122
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,890
dramatic expression of the necessary 
human system of values and that that's 

123
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:16,400
built into us.
It's,

124
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,060
it's,
it's part of our nature.

125
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,120
We have a nature as human beings.
We're not infinitely malleable white 

126
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:28,341
culture,
which is a postmodernist claim and a 

127
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:33,591
dangerous one.
It's dangerous if we have a nature.

128
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,570
Okay.

129
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,410
Paglia has this idea

130
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,720
that

131
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,920
the reason that you come to university 
and you studied the humanities or the 

132
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,821
proper reason if you do that,
is not to engage in premature and 

133
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:55,950
destructive criticism of something that 
you don't even yet understand,

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,110
but to learn as much as you can about

135
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,540
art and literature and poetry and drama 
and fiction and religious thinking and 

136
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:14,140
this is all a kind of a.
You think about it as a.

137
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,180
What is that?
What is all that?

138
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,260
It's art culture.
Music belongs in that category and like 

139
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:24,260
what the hell?
What,

140
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,320
what about music?
It's like everyone loves it or almost 

141
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,540
every one.
It's a mystery.

142
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,000
You listened to music and it's very 
meaningful.

143
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,850
I mean music gets people through some 
pretty dark times.

144
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,750
Why it's not obvious,
that's for sure.

145
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,900
You know when in most cultures,
music plays a very central role in 

146
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,871
identity formation and you guys,
I think you'll probably find as you age 

147
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:50,741
that your favorite music will be the 
music that you listened to between the 

148
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:54,851
ages of 16 and 20.
It's kind of like an imprint on you and 

149
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:58,120
it defines a maybe that defines a 
generation and maybe you know,

150
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,130
in our tribal past,
and this is highly likely when you were 

151
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:08,251
being inculcated into the tribal culture
that was inculcated with dance and with 

152
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:13,030
masks and with music all at the same 
time.

153
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,240
So you're invited to participate in this
drama and to take your place in this 

154
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,480
drama and to think of that as a 
representation of the objective world is

155
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,260
just not right.
That isn't what it is.

156
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,960
It's an invitation to a drama.

157
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,370
Now.
Then the question might be,

158
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,400
well is the drama reel,
and the answer to that is depends on 

159
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:39,711
what you mean by real.
I think that great dramas are more real 

160
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:42,630
than real.
They're hyper real there.

161
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,440
They're hyper real because they provide 
guidelines about how to act that are 

162
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,010
abstract and even perhaps generic,
but applicable across an extraordinary 

163
00:10:56,231 --> 00:10:58,000
broad range of situations.
