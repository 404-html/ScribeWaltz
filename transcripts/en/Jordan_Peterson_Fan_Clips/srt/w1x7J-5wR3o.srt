1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,550
I was having a discussion with Sam 
Harris the other day,

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:06,390
which was very,
um,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,650
what would you say?
He said we got wrapped around an axle,

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:15,651
which is pretty much hate.
Sam Harris is one of the four famous 

5
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:19,820
atheists along with Christopher Hitchens
and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennett.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,760
Yeah.
And so we were having a discussion and 

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,990
um,
he's a determinist just right down to 

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:27,990
the bottom.
It's like you're determined,

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,180
you're determined.
There's no freewill.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,460
You're a deterministic machine.
And you know,

11
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:35,160
if you're a coherent scientist and 
you're a Newtonian,

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,190
roughly speaking,
you don't really have much choice other 

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,711
than to think that way,
but that isn't how it seems to people 

14
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:46,310
and we don't treat each other that way.
And our entire legal system is 

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,300
predicated on the idea that you do in 
fact have freewill.

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,500
So.
Well,

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,060
can we account for it?
Well,

18
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:56,061
no.
And do we have a scientific model for 

19
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:56,061
it?

20
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:56,460
No,
but then I would also say we do not have

21
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:01,461
a scientific model for consciousness.
We don't know a damn thing about 

22
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,850
consciousness,
which is why Dan Dennett book,

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,070
which was called consciousness 
explained,

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,280
was referred to.
It's by it's critics as consciousness 

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,251
explained a way,
which is exactly right as far as I'm 

26
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:16,581
concerned because he took a mechanistic 
approach and I just don't think you get 

27
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:18,930
to do that because there's something 
really weird about consciousness.

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,990
I mean,
th,

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,750
the phenomenologists Heidegger,
who tried to radically transform western

30
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,330
philosophy right from the bottom up,
he basically said,

31
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:28,350
well,
you know,

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,100
you can treat the world as if 
consciousness is primary and that human 

33
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,290
experience is reality.
That's reality and that he doesn't exist

34
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,860
independently of consciousness in any 
explicable way.

35
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,580
It's like,
well,

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,640
what's out there?
If there's nothing to to experience it?

37
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,260
Well,
everything at once.

38
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:47,280
It's something like that.

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,280
It's,
it's not really comprehensible as 

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,320
without a subject that subject defines 
it.

41
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,390
It makes it real.
Now you don't have to believe that,

42
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:59,391
but,
but at least I'm telling you that there 

43
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:02,241
are thoroughly coherent philosophical 
positions that make that case very 

44
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:07,971
strongly and that that allow 
consciousness to exist as a phenomena 

45
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:12,561
and to take it seriously and you 
certainly act like you take it 

46
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:15,861
seriously.
You Act like there's a you and that you 

47
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:16,980
make choices and you certainly treat 
other people that way.

48
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,340
Deterministic or not,
you're still going to get angry when 

49
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,621
they're being rude to you and you're 
going to act as if they had some choice 

50
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:26,220
in the matter.
Now maybe that's an illusion possibly,

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,400
but maybe it's not.
And I would say the oldest stories that 

52
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,530
we have always include that as not only 
as a fundamental element,

53
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,860
but even as the fundamental element so.

54
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,030
Well,
so you can think about that however you 

55
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,030
want.
But anyways,

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,940
so Japan comes along and he's going to 
finish off the puppet.

57
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,850
And so what does he do to finish off the
puppet?

58
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:48,880
He gives it a.
it's,

59
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,600
it gives it a voice.
It gives it a mouth.

60
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,800
Well,
that's really,

61
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,590
really interesting.
So in Genesis,

62
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:57,390
in Genesis,
this is a,

63
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,450
this is a very,
very complex idea and it took people 

64
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,241
thousands of years to figure this idea 
out and it's something like this is so 

65
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:10,830
at the beginning of everything,
there was chaos and that was like 

66
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,460
potential.
It was something like potential,

67
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,390
the potential for being and God who is 
God?

68
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:20,290
The father in the genesis account uses a
faculty that he has,

69
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,320
which is the word to call being from 
chaos knots,

70
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,140
the creation of Ba,
right?

71
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:34,141
It's the.
It's the manifestation of order from 

72
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:36,580
chaos and it's the word,
the logos that it's.

73
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,730
It's the logos.
That's the tool that God uses to do that

74
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:43,330
and that logos in Christianity is 
associated with Christ,

75
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:48,331
which is a very weird thing,
but the reason for that is that there's 

76
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:51,750
an idea that the divine element of the 
individual is the thing that uses 

77
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,850
language,
communicative language to call the world

78
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:02,851
into being,
and that is what we do as far as we can 

79
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:02,851
tell.
It's like you make a decision.

80
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,080
You think it through,
you talk it over with your friends,

81
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,370
you plot a course and the world 
manifests itself in relationship to your

82
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:14,371
choice and it's for that reason and it 
is for that reason that in genesis and 

83
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:18,691
in many other accounts that that logo's 
capacity is identified with human 

84
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:23,761
beings.
It's like you have a small bit of that 

85
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:23,761
in you.
Whatever that means,

86
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:27,510
and you participate in the process of 
continually generating order out of 

87
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:32,260
chaos and and sometimes the reverse,
you mediate between them and so and that

88
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,480
is that in our,
in,

89
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:33,940
in,
in,

90
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,600
in Western culture and certainly the 
case at other cultures as well,

91
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,870
that that's why you have rights.

92
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,810
Fundamentally.
That's why the law has to respect you is

93
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:48,700
because you've got this spark of 
divinity in you that's transcendent that

94
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:51,820
nobody gets to transgress against and 
you say,

95
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:52,960
well,
do you believe that?

96
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:53,680
It's like,
well,

97
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,160
you act like you believe it.
You treat other people like you believe 

98
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,081
it or they're not very happy with you.
So it depends on what you mean by 

99
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:06,760
believe you acted out well.
Do you accept it as a proposition?

100
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,860
Oh,
I don't care if you accept that as a 

101
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:11,860
proposition,
frankly,

102
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,230
because I think the best indicator of 
what you believe is how you act.

103
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,530
Not what you say because what do you 
know about what you know?

104
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,070
Hardly anything and so actions speak 
louder than words and if you want to be 

105
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:28,651
treated properly by someone,
what that means is that you want to 

106
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:30,190
treat them,
you want them to treat you as a valuable

107
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:31,630
autonomous entity.

108
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,080
That's what you want.
And so maybe you're not that.

109
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:40,081
Maybe you're a deterministic puppet and 
what this strange movie suggests is that

110
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:44,530
you are kind of a deterministic puppet,
but that you don't have to be all right,

111
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,960
well you,
the mouth goes on and then Japan was 

112
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:49,960
happy about that and then they have a 
little dance,

113
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,360
you know,
they,

114
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,420
they turn the music on and all these 
little music boxes and they all play 

115
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,780
together and it's like harmony of some 
sort has been established because that's

116
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:04,781
what the music represents and the,
there's layers of reality that are 

117
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,740
communicating with one another because 
that's what the music represents.

118
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,470
And then they have a little dance and 
the idea is that,

119
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,770
well,
it's a good thing to let this puppet 

120
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:14,870
habits own voice.
Well,

121
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,180
that's an interesting idea because what 
the hell does it?

122
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,070
No,
it's a wooden headed marionette.

123
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,380
Why the hell would you want something 
like that to talk?

124
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Well,
it's the same question you have in 

125
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:26,980
relationship to your children.
It's like what do they know?

126
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,630
They're two or three,
you know,

127
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,310
they don't know anything.
Well,

128
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:35,240
so should you just like tyrannized them 
and make them do everything you want?

129
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,040
Are you going to let them have a bit of 
a voice?

130
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,620
And the question is,
it depends on whether do we want them to

131
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:44,621
be a puppet or not.
And if you don't want them to be a 

132
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:45,290
puppet,
if you want them to grow up autonomous,

133
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:49,580
then you let them have a voice and you 
facilitate the development of that voice

134
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,620
and so and,
and,

135
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,500
and that's.
And that's what you do if you don't want

136
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,660
a marionette.
So,

137
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,060
and Japan who doesn't want a marionette.
So he gives the puppet of voice even 

138
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,870
though he knows it's just a puppet and 
that it's,

139
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
it doesn't know anything.

140
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,360
And then this is fantastic.
So the cricket sitting up there watching

141
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,650
that,
he's pretty happy with it.

142
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:14,651
That's the first little seed and you see
there and he's sitting by this other 

143
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:17,651
thing that is just not happy at all and 
if that's the terrible father and you 

144
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:21,020
see it's a character that repeats 
throughout the entire movie.

145
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:26,021
You see manifestations of the tyrannical
father continually through the movie in 

146
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:28,010
different characters.
Like he's played out by different roles.

147
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,370
And so first of all,
the cricket is so thrilled about this.

148
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:35,420
And then he looks at the frowning king 
there who's,

149
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,450
who is not happy that the puppet has 
been given a voice.

150
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:39,380
He's a tyrant,
right?

151
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:44,381
He's the representation of a tyrant and 
a tyrant does not want you to have a 

152
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,561
voice.
And so the cricket looks at him and 

153
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:47,561
says,
well,

154
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:47,561
you can't please everybody all the time.

155
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,660
And it's just this tiny little fragment 
of a joke,

156
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:51,320
you know.
But it's,

157
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,000
there's this old idea.
I think it comes from Chekhov and,

158
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,520
and the idea is that if you set a 
playoff and there's a gun,

159
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,400
a rifle or a pistol on a table in the 
first act,

160
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,190
it better have been used by the third 
act.

161
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:09,191
Or it shouldn't have been there at all 
and the idea is you don't put anything 

162
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:12,890
in your play that it's random.
You never do that.

163
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,560
It's like,
because this isn't life,

164
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,470
that,
that this isn't life.

165
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,480
This is a work of art and everything is 
connected and it's caught know it's 

166
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,110
there by intent.
And so this isn't accidental that this 

167
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,270
little king character doesn't like 
what's going on or that he shows up.

168
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,320
So anyways,
all,

169
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,400
all the clocks go off and the music 
boxes go and they have a little dance 

170
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,400
and everybody's happy about it.

171
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,670
And,
and then Japan notices what time it is.

172
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:45,671
And so there's a tremendous emphasis on 
time in this part of the movie because 

173
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:47,540
there are all these clocks are going off
and they're all telling him what time it

174
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:52,541
is.
Like 30 clocks go off and then he takes 

175
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:52,730
his watch out and notices what time it 
is.

176
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:57,731
It's like the idea that there's 
something about going on is like whack 

177
00:08:57,731 --> 00:08:59,160
that you,
you know,

178
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,840
dozens of times so that you get it.
And it's a little joke that he pulls out

179
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:06,030
his watch and he figures out it's time 
for bed.

180
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,360
Well,
so now we're making a transition between

181
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:11,280
the conscious world and the unconscious 
world.

182
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,720
Okay.
So,

183
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:17,721
so there's an intimation in the movie 
that everything that happens now is in 

184
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:20,410
the unconscious world.
And the way you know that is that it's,

185
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,990
it's strange because the movie moves in 
and out of this underworld.

186
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,320
But at the very end,
when Pinocchio's transformed into a real

187
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:33,321
boy,
the last thing Japan does is I think 

188
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:36,141
it's Japan always hit one of the 
pendulums and start all the clocks 

189
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:37,080
again.
So it says,

190
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:41,280
if what happens from here onwards is 
part of a dream,

191
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,760
now it's,
it's murky because Pinocchio goes to 

192
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,970
school and you know,
there's the next day and all of that.

193
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:52,971
But.
And so those are sort of realistic 

194
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:55,131
elements.
But then there's also the whole going 

195
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:55,131
down into the ocean to find the whale 
thing,

196
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:58,971
which seems completely dreamlike and,
but there's an intimation that we're in 

197
00:09:58,971 --> 00:09:59,680
a different kind of world.
And,

198
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,190
and so we go to,
they all go to sleep,

199
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,920
including the cricket.
And so then Japan,

200
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,940
oh,
notices the star and because he's a good

201
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,941
guy,
he makes a wish on the start and we've 

202
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:14,280
already explained why you might wish on 
a star and what that might mean.

203
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,040
And He makes it very interesting wish.
Um,

204
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,510
it's,
it's not a self serving wish.

205
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,260
In fact,
it's quite the contrary.

206
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,980
He doesn't wish that Pinocchio is an 
obedient son.

207
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,310
He doesn't wish that he's produced 
someone who will work for him.

208
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,240
He doesn't wish any of that.
He wishes what a good father would wish,

209
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,570
which is that the creation that he's 
brought forth would develop its capacity

210
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,910
for autonomy.
He wants them to become real.

211
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:46,911
He wants him to become an actual living 
creature and not a wooden headed 

212
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,420
marionette.
And so you'd say,

213
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:50,910
well,
that is what your father should wish for

214
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:51,560
you.
You know,

215
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,200
and I have clients frequently whose 
fathers weren't like that at all.

216
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,450
They were to radical or they were 
neglectful or,

217
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,710
or they punish this person every time 
they did something good.

218
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,040
That's a real fun game.
They competed with them and undermining 

219
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:12,831
them at every opportunity.
They didn't want to produce someone 

220
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:12,831
strong.
And autonomous,

221
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:17,090
they wanted to give birth to a slave and
then diminish it as much as possible.

222
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,110
And so that's bad.
It's not good and not so Japan was not 

223
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,110
like that.
So he says,

224
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,911
well,
I'm going to wish for something 

225
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:29,280
completely unreasonable,
which is that part of that ideal idea,

226
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:34,281
right?
And they're unreasonable thing is that 

227
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:34,530
this puppet could become

228
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,270
real,
could actually take on its autonomy and,

229
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,150
and move forward.
And so that's what he wishes.

230
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,330
And then they go to sleep

231
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,220
and then the cricket starts to become 
driven mad by the noises of the clock.

232
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:53,020
And so it's like he's going into the 
sort of,

233
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,650
of hyper alertness and the clocks are 
clanging.

234
00:11:56,651 --> 00:12:01,651
Adam and Jupiter was snoring and,
and that he can even hear the little 

235
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:04,860
grains of sand falling out of the,
out of the our glass.

236
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:07,180
He's becoming hyper alert,
hyper alert,

237
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,950
and then he yelled,
stop.

238
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,510
And all the clock stop.
Which is pretty good trick for cricket,

239
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,730
you know,
it's like he's the master of time.

240
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:19,600
But also we're in a place now where time
has come to a stop or outside of time.

241
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,570
And one of the things that Freud pointed
about,

242
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:25,120
dreams is that dreams are kind of 
outside of time.

243
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,780
Now,
here's what that means is first of all,

244
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,820
they draw and eternal themes.
That's part of it.

245
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,680
But you know,
he must have had this experience.

246
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,680
And Freud noted this carefully in the 
interpretation of dreams where you know 

247
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,250
you're sleeping and the alarm goes off 
and the alarm noise is incorporated into

248
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:46,501
your dream.
And it's like the dream has been going 

249
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:49,501
on for an hour in subjective time.
And you wake up and you realize that 

250
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:49,501
it's the alarm clock.
It's like.

251
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,550
And there's no reason why your dream 
time should be the same as real time 

252
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,480
because it's all going on in your 
imagination.

253
00:12:55,481 --> 00:13:00,481
But it's amazing in some sense how much 
can happen in such a short period of 

254
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:03,880
time in your imagination.
And so it's outside of time.

255
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:07,030
The world of fantasy is in some sense 
out of outside of time.

256
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:10,960
And so the cricket tells time to stop 
and it does.

257
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,430
And then the star enlarges and it turns 
into this blue fairy who's got a 

258
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,420
celestial gown covered with stars.

259
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,140
And who's got wings,
so she's kind of some ethereal being and

260
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,230
like you don't have a problem with that 
in the movie.

261
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:32,860
It's like,
yeah,

262
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:33,490
sure.
I mean,

263
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:35,370
you know,
it's a ferry.

264
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:37,180
It came from a star.
That makes perfect sense,

265
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:40,210
which of course it does.
It makes no sense whatsoever.

266
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,950
Right?
It makes no sense,

267
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:46,090
but you're willing to go along with it 
because on the one hand it makes sense.

268
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:51,150
No sense.
And on the other hand it makes perfect 

269
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,150
sense.
It's like the fairy godmother idea.

270
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,150
It's like,
yeah,

271
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,330
yeah,
fairy God,

272
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,050
mother,
no problem.

273
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:53,050
We,
we got that.

274
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,700
And it's in the idea there is that while
nature comes to your aid,

275
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:58,870
it's something like that.
It's,

276
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,880
it's,
it's the benevolent force of nature is 

277
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,661
on your side now,
not obviously only on your side because 

278
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:10,030
it opposes you as well,
but then there's your own mother as well

279
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,250
who's also nature,
who's on your site.

280
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,580
And so,
but there's an idea here and the idea is

281
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:20,581
that if the father gets the wish right,
the aim right for the child,

282
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,760
then nature will cooperate.
Right?

283
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,530
And that's true.
I believe that's true.

284
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:31,531
Is that if you set up your relationship,
your cultural relationship with your 

285
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:33,700
child properly,
then they're far more likely to flourish

286
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,730
and so you get the magic of nature on 
your side by establishing the proper 

287
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,480
aim.
And so that's what happens.

288
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:41,260
Japan.
Oh says,

289
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:42,040
well,
this is what I'm.

290
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,100
This is what I'm aiming at and because 
he's aiming at at it and because it's 

291
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:52,111
within the realm of possibility,
nature comes to his service and that is 

292
00:14:52,111 --> 00:14:54,860
how it works.
That's exactly how it works because when

293
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:59,861
you aim at something,
then you muster your biological forces 

294
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:05,081
towards that goal and if the goal is 
feasible and attainable,

295
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:09,200
then you will cooperate with yourself.

296
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,740
And so that's quite cool.
Carl Rogers would call that.

297
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,050
What's the word for that?
I think he called a genuineness,

298
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,920
which is kind of weak,
but.

299
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,980
But I think.
I think that's still what he called it.

300
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,880
He sort of meant that.
Well,

301
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:27,881
that's sort of what happens when your,
when your goals and your physiological 

302
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:32,060
and biological being are aligned well 
and you're and you can communicate both.

303
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:37,061
You're not full of internal 
contradictions and so your conscious 

304
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:41,110
aims and your biological possibilities 
are manifesting themselves in the same 

305
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,700
direction.
And so while that would be good,

306
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,120
so anyways,
the fairy shows up and she's quite 

307
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,120
sexually attractive.
She's quite provocative and she,

308
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,050
she charms the cricket and who gets all 
blushes and like is all,

309
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,460
you know,
embarrassed and overwhelmed by this like

310
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,960
figure of celestial beauty and decides 
to cooperate.

311
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:06,110
That conscience decides to cooperate and
get some responsibility.

312
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:11,110
And so the ferry allows the puppet to 
move without strings.

313
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,380
So that's kind of interesting.
So it's the intervention of nature.

314
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,330
Culture focuses the aim and then it's 
the intervention of nature that produces

315
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:23,040
the autonomy and that seems to be right.
I mean,

316
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,620
even though it's not that 
understandable,

317
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:29,621
it seems to be right.
And then so she takes the strings off 

318
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,550
Pinocchio and you might say,
well,

319
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:36,551
that's partly because your child is not 
certainly not just a creature of 

320
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:40,481
culture.
By no means your child has a 

321
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:42,221
temperament.
You'll see that right away and that 

322
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:44,711
temperament will unfold and hopefully 
it'll unfold in a cultural context 

323
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:49,151
that's amenable to it.
And that the combination of those two 

324
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,821
things will produce something new,
he can talk,

325
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:59,350
he can walk,
and so the good fairy basically tells 

326
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,921
him that he's got a bit of autonomy and 
now it's up to him to like clue in Tibet

327
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:08,350
and act properly and learn the 
difference between good and evil and to 

328
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:08,450
speak truthfully and all that.

329
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,750
It's a bit a propagandistic that part of
the movie I would say,

330
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,080
but it doesn't really matter.
It's kind of inculcation of conventional

331
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:20,081
morality and there's a fair bit to it,
especially that he's supposed to tell 

332
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:20,720
the truth.
And uh,

333
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,130
you know,
he says he will.

334
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,480
And the crickets listening.
And then the puppet asks,

335
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:27,920
well,
what does conscience mean?

336
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:33,070
Because the ferry says,
always let your conscience be your 

337
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,070
guide.
And he says,

338
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:33,920
well,
what does consciousness mean?

339
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:38,921
And then the bug who's like all puffed 
up because he wants to impress the 

340
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:42,071
ferry,
plops down and gets on his little 

341
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:44,291
matchbox and gives this like horrible 
little lecture about how to behave 

342
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,430
properly.
That's just like ideological chatter.

343
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,110
You could hardly even stand listening to
it.

344
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:53,111
And it's supposed to be like that.
It's generic moral advice that anyone 

345
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:58,431
could give that's kind of dull and,
and also puffed up and grandiose and 

346
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,240
he's just not very good at it.

347
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,900
So,
and that's why he's on his little 

348
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:05,900
matchbox there with his chest puffed 
out.

349
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,920
And so he says that's just the travel 
with the world today.

350
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,200
And uh,
and I think that's his opening line,

351
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:15,201
you know,
he's diagnosing the whole world and you 

352
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:15,201
know,
the fairy,

353
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:17,580
she thinks he's kind of funny because he
is and you know,

354
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:22,581
it's sort of,
there's a real interesting thing here 

355
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:23,820
going on because he's male and he's,
he's all puffed up with his knowledge,

356
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:28,821
which is completely shallow.
And then he's put in contact with this 

357
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:31,620
celestial feminine ideal and he just 
turns into a complete moron.

358
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:34,740
And that's exactly what happens to man.
It happens to them all the time.

359
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,220
So anyways,
she decides to give them a chance and 

360
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,590
turns them into this conscience and all 
of a sudden he's this like 19 twenties 

361
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,590
millionaires.
So He's been,

362
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,350
he's been ennobled,
but then she tells him that,

363
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,430
you know,
he has to journey along with Pinocchio 

364
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,830
in order for things to go properly and 
he promises that he'll be a good 

365
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,881
conscience and do it and he already 
thinks that he can do it and that's why 

366
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:00,370
he's on the matchbox podium,
you know,

367
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,460
espousing his morality.

368
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,280
But the reality turns out to be much 
more complex.

369
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,270
So the bug has a little talk with the 
cricket or the bug has a little talk 

370
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:17,691
with the puppet and the Bug tries to 
tell Pinocchio explicitly what it means 

371
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:23,001
to be good and he gets completely 
tangled up in the explanation because 

372
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:24,360
what the hell does he know?
And the,

373
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,120
the Papa doesn't understand anything 
that he says anyways.

374
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:32,121
And so there's a message there and the 
message is the kind of knowledge that 

375
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:37,221
the conscience is that the conscience 
and the puppet are supposed to cocreate 

376
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:40,350
is not something that you can articulate
easily as a table of rules.

377
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:45,410
It's not like that because life is too 
complicated to just have fought five 

378
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,180
rules that you live by and that will 
solve every problem.

379
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,020
Partly because the rules will conflict.
That's a huge part of the problem,

380
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,350
right?

381
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,760
One moral guideline contradicts another 
ines situations like you don't know what

382
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:58,680
to do.
So anyways,

383
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:02,670
they decided that there they decided 
that they're just going to.

384
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,740
He says,
Pinocchio says,

385
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,050
well I'll be a good boy,
and the cricket says,

386
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,490
well that's the spirit,
and then,

387
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,620
well then Japan,
oh,

388
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:15,650
gets wind of it and they have a little 
like horror episode and then he finds 

389
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:20,460
out that the public can is autonomous 
and they have a little party which tells

390
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:25,461
you exactly what your pedals up to is.
The autonomy emerges and he's happy 

391
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:30,051
about it.
So it's stamping home the notion that 

392
00:20:30,051 --> 00:20:31,860
Japan is in fact a good guy and that 
that is in fact what he wants.

393
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:37,010
So it's like the encouragement of your 
father is a precondition for the 

394
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,511
emergence of your individuality and,
and it also allows the feminine to play 

395
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:46,851
a role both as nature and perhaps as 
mother and so and the combination of 

396
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:49,090
those two produces the autonomous 
individual.

397
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,690
It's like,
well,

398
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:53,650
that seems perfectly reasonable.
So off they go to sleep,

399
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,070
next day they wake up and it's a new day
and,

400
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:02,310
and Pinocchio is off to school and 
that's a good thing too because Japan 

401
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,900
isn't and he's really excited about it.
And so what that means is that he's been

402
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,840
parented properly and he's going to go 
out into the world of his peers,

403
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,080
which is where he belongs.
And Japan isn't too worried about it.

404
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:16,030
In fact,
he is pushing them out the door,

405
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,200
you know,
it's like go,

406
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,840
you can do it,
this is the next thing.

407
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,990
The kid isn't cowering in the corner and
overcome by terror with the parents 

408
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,440
freaking out about all the things that 
are going to go wrong.

409
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:28,690
It's,
there's some faith in his,

410
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,750
his ability.
So he sees all the kids wandering by 

411
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,090
and,
and Japan,

412
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,950
no dresses them up and sends them off to
school and so and so.

413
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,200
That's good.
So that's a happy family story.

414
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:44,190
It's like mom and dad got together.
They decided that there,

415
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
the kid was gonna,
you know,

416
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,020
be competent and autonomous and ready to
face the world.

417
00:21:50,021 --> 00:21:55,021
And so Audi goals and so he's like five 
years old at this point or something 

418
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:58,981
like that and that's where we get,
that's where we're at in the story and I

419
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:04,441
think that's a good place to stop 
because the next thing that happens is 

420
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:08,200
normally essentially it's like Pinocchio
goes off to be a good boy,

421
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,250
but it turns out that that's a hell of a
lot more complicated than he might think

422
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:15,970
because there are actually complications
in the world,

423
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:20,560
but also malevolence right?
The desire for things not to go right.

424
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:25,561
There are people who are not oriented 
towards the ideal in any way.

425
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,410
Adult and Pinocchio's young and naive 
and so he has no defense whatsoever 

426
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:35,590
against this malevolence and that's,
you know,

427
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,270
that's not an expect,
not unexpected.

428
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,450
And it also turns out that the 
conscience,

429
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,540
the cricket,
who is still not very clued in over 

430
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,500
sleeps.
And so he's just not there at a critical

431
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,570
moment.
But I think we'll pick that up.

432
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,400
We'll pick that up next week because 
this is a good point in the plot to stop

433
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,630
the child has entered the broader world 
and has to cope with it.

434
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,260
And so he's prepared because he had a 
wonderful father and he had a magical 

435
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,860
mother and so he's as prepared as you 
can be.

436
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,560
He's not even completely a marionette 
anymore,

437
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,120
but,
but,

438
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,360
but now it's up to him.
That's the thing.

439
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,150
Now it's up to him and his parents have 
done basically what they could.

440
