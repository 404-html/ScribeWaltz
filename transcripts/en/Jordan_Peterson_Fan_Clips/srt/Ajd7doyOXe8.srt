1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,880
I'm Dr Peterson.
Thank you.

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:05,280
First of all.
It's a great pleasure being here.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,610
It's awesome to see you live.
I basically got into your work's just 

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,390
earlier this year and I had an original 
question,

5
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:15,020
but your talk today kind of made me 
decide to change my mind.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,950
I was going to ask,
um,

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,100
do you feel as though would you agree 
with me in the sentiment that the left 

8
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:27,361
has pushed so hard for total control of 
our society over the last however many 

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,210
years?
It's almost to a point where saying 2013

10
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:32,520
was a different time.
Um,

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,240
would you say that because they pushed 
so hard,

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,540
they've created this backlash and the 
backlash created caused them to backlash

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,250
back again.
So they doubled down with their ideology

14
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:47,280
and then they get,
they lose another argument,

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,520
they lose another ideological war.
They knew lose another me more and they 

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,350
double down and they doubled down again 
and again.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,650
And they can't seem to mean.
They can't seem to argue.

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,120
They can't see,
they can't,

19
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,130
they don't want to have an intellectual 
discussion.

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,340
And as an,
an interpretation of what you were 

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,980
saying there is no,
there doesn't seem to be any,

22
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:10,920
any,
any care of what's right with them.

23
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,260
They just want power,
they just want,

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,870
they just want to win.
Um,

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,930
do you,
would you agree with the sentiment that 

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,440
they're burning themselves out and 
creating the mass red pilling of the,

27
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:27,441
uh,
conservative movement that we see going 

28
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:29,811
on?
Would you possibly think that maybe 

29
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:30,450
they've committed suicide and,
and talks like this,

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,540
people like yourself,
Ben Shapiro and others who talk to 

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,060
people like the subjects that we do the 
taboo of nowadays?

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,650
Um,
possibly that this,

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,700
this is the answer to defeat the leftist
stranglehold on our society.

34
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,130
I will untangle some of that.
Okay.

35
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,710
So first of all,
well,

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,720
first of all,
the first observation is a really 

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,270
interesting one because you know that 
things can go out of hand very,

38
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:02,271
very rapidly.
And the reason they do that is because 

39
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:02,271
of positive feedback loops.
Now,

40
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:07,250
the thing that Kurzweil talks about is a
positive feedback that an intelligent 

41
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,061
machine makes another intelligent 
machine that makes another intelligent 

42
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:11,400
machine.
And that's a positive feedback loop.

43
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:15,060
And that can spiral upwards out of 
control very rapidly.

44
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:17,280
And that's when polarization is.
It's like,

45
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,770
I tap you,
you tap me,

46
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,190
I slapped you,
you punch me well up.

47
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,690
It goes.
Well,

48
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,940
I think that's partly why in the New 
Testament,

49
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:30,240
for example,
there's an injunction that says turn the

50
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:32,820
other cheek,
resist not evil.

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Why?
Because otherwise you get into a 

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,961
positive feedback loop and then you 
better look the hell out and things can 

53
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:41,970
tilt very,
very rapidly.

54
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,110
I mean,
all you have to do,

55
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,480
look at what happened in World War One.
No one expected that.

56
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:50,481
It was like one,
one relatively minor member,

57
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,240
I think of the aristocracy,
if I remember correctly,

58
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,510
was assassinated in one minor little 
country.

59
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,670
It's like bang,
everything fell apart.

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,620
And that's positive feedback loops.
Right?

61
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,340
And so that's what we're in right now 
and we've got to be.

62
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:10,341
And that's a really chaotic time.
And so I would say maintain self control

63
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,020
and don't aim to win.
Amen.

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,300
Piece.
Because winning,

65
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:19,480
that's not peace.
It's better to aim for peace.

66
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,240
You know,
I've got this talk coming up in November

67
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:27,241
11th.
I'm quite worried about it because I 

68
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,120
know there's going to be protesters 
there and that they'd been emboldened by

69
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:31,840
the fact that they shut the torque down 
before and I want to make a video.

70
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:36,841
I'll probably do it tomorrow,
telling everyone that comes to that 

71
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,301
meeting to like watch their bloody step 
and stay out of the gutter because you 

72
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,380
just,
we're at,

73
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,130
we're at.

74
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,670
We're at a point now where under the 
wrong circumstances,

75
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,430
if the wrong person does the wrong 
thing,

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,130
that the consequences will be very 
great.

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Now we can't predict which action is 
going to precipitate that and or even if

78
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:05,020
that will happen,
but it's chaotic enough so that it could

79
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,940
happen.
So you know,

80
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:10,260
also govern yourselves accordingly.
Now the problem is,

81
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:15,261
is that there are people who would be 
happy if there was blood running in the 

82
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:18,781
street.
They're the same sort of people that 

83
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:18,781
shoot up high schools or kill innocent,
you know,

84
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:22,390
elementary school kids just to show what
they're made of and what they believe.

85
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,180
And that's a big problem.
But for the rest of us,

86
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:30,181
like hopefully calmer heads can prevail.
And so it really is important not to 

87
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:32,830
win,
it's like fighting with your wife.

88
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,970
You don't when you can't,
because you have to live with her.

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,360
She can't win.
But maybe you can solve the problem and 

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,631
bring about peace.
And so you've got to practice doing 

91
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:46,180
that.
Practice restraint now.

92
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,210
And remember too that these people that 
you're talking about who are radical 

93
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,901
leftist is most of the time,
they're not like they're 95 percent like

94
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,160
you.
And if you pull them out of the mob,

95
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:59,950
they're just like your,
your neighbors.

96
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:03,580
Nineteen year old kid who's kind of 
clueless and rebellious.

97
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:06,910
Right?
And who you might even like you put them

98
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,440
in the mob,
it's a whole different thing.

99
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,600
And so you gotta remember that too.
Oh,

100
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,050
the fear of social isolation kind of how
they're acting.

101
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,130
I saying no,
it's just that they're possessed by 

102
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:19,130
these ideas,
but,

103
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,380
but only partially,
you know,

104
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,970
you hardly find it full blooded.
Absolutely committed radical leftist 

105
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:27,430
activist,
you know,

106
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,140
like there are some,
but not very many.

107
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:32,350
Most of it is just fragmentary behavior.

108
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,440
And you have to remember that like when 
the students come out to protest me was 

109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,000
a case,
particularly at mcmaster,

110
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:43,001
I have to remember these kids,
they're not much different than my kids.

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,340
They are when they're in a stupid mob 
behind a hammer and sickle flag,

112
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,240
you know,
but,

113
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,540
but,
but you don't want to make a low 

114
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,140
resolution,
homogenous representation of them.

115
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,720
And so,
and so.

116
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,360
That's why again,
I think instead of winning,

117
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,540
you turn to your own development,
you turn to your own development,

118
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:10,541
you do what you can to stop doing the 
things that you're doing that aren't 

119
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,990
good because you're not going to hurt 
anybody if you do that,

120
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,410
all you're going to do is help.
And otherwise you'll participate in this

121
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:20,120
polarization.
And that's unless you want that,

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,560
you know,
there's a dark part of people that it's 

123
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,080
part of the part that voted for trump 
would like to burn things to the ground.

124
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,400
It's like the hell I know how people 
felt when they went into the voting 

125
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:32,400
booth.
It was like Hillary,

126
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,890
Hillary or trump,
you know?

127
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:38,891
And that's a,
that's a hell of a thing to say to hell 

128
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:38,891
with it,
you know,

129
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:42,760
although I could,
I could certainly understand that 

130
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,861
sentiment.
So we have to be careful and all of you 

131
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:49,951
people who are here who are advocates of
free speech and who are theoretically 

132
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,500
happy to come hear me speak,
it's like I really do believe in.

133
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:58,501
I truly believe this and this is 
something I learned in part from social 

134
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,511
knits and then part from y'all missed 
that the way that you set the world 

135
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:04,400
straight is by constraining the 
malevolence in your own heart.

136
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,020
And that's no joke,
man.

137
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:11,021
That's no easy thing and that's a good 
voyage for people to go on if they want 

138
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:12,440
something difficult and worthwhile to 
do.

139
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,080
So.
Thank you very much.

140
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,590
Okay,
just a quick thing.

141
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,330
We're not gonna have time for pictures,
so you're.

142
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,810
Unless you're yours is the last 
question.

143
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,880
Okay.
So sorry to everybody else,

144
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,400
but you're the last one.
Okay.

145
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,820
Hi Dr Peterson.
Thanks for coming.

146
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,890
Uh,
my question is a little bit off topic 

147
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,760
from everything else tonight,
but I really wanted to hear what you had

148
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:44,761
to say about it.
I work in residence life here at UBC and

149
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,450
in the community where I am.
We were recently affected by a suicide 

150
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,030
of someone who lived in our community 
and that I was upset about it,

151
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,610
not just because obviously it's a 
horrible thing to have happen,

152
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,150
but also because Rez life in the 
university,

153
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:06,151
like they talk all this talk about self 
care and your mental health is so 

154
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,620
important to us.
But then things like this still happen.

155
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,690
So I wanted to know,
like if you think like,

156
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,710
what do you think the university should 
be doing to keep stuff like this from 

157
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,461
happening in the future?
Well,

158
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,740
it's not self evident that it's the 
university's responsibility and the 

159
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:31,570
reason for that.
I'm not saying it isn't.

160
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,380
Okay,
I'm,

161
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,440
I'm saying it's not self evident that it
is because different institutions can 

162
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,241
only do so many things and we are 
already recording the universities to 

163
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:46,890
educate and to act as substitute parents
increasingly.

164
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,140
And to take on the role of judge,
jury and executioner as

165
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,490
there are more,

166
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,730
what should be criminal cases being 
handled within the university?

167
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:00,170
Say,

168
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,540
um,

169
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,180
having said that,
you could ask the broader question is,

170
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:13,181
well,
what do you do to help people be 

171
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:16,370
sufficiently in love with life so that 
they don't wish to end it now?

172
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:21,371
And I've tried to puzzle through that 
for a long time and that's partly why 

173
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:21,980
I've written the things that I've 
written.

174
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,340
It's partly why I've produced the online
programs that I've produced,

175
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,750
you know,
and so we know that if you do,

176
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,880
if you have students do the future 
authoring program,

177
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:36,881
for example,
they're much less likely to drop out of 

178
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:36,890
university about 30 percent less likely 
and their grades go up.

179
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:41,390
And that's especially true if they're 
male and marginalized.

180
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,730
It has a bigger impact on those 
communities.

181
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,110
And so,
you know,

182
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:47,630
I've tried to get university's interests
now the data's there,

183
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:52,631
but they're not.
And it's very difficult to get a big 

184
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:52,631
bureaucracy to move.

185
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:54,950
A big,
big is a mobile.

186
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,760
So I'm not sure if there's anything they
can really do about it that it's 

187
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,291
certainly possible that the things that 
they're trying to do about it or making 

188
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:05,291
it worse,
you know,

189
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,020
that's another thing that you learn if 
you're a good social scientists,

190
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,040
just like there was evidence,
and I don't know if this is still the 

191
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,040
case,
but.

192
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,360
But there was good evidence.
I looked into this about 15 years ago.

193
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Say you want to prevent suicides,
suicide hotline in your town and you 

194
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,990
advertise it.
What happens?

195
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,560
Suicide rate goes up because you're 
advertising suicide,

196
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,430
right?
And lots of lots of interventions are 

197
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,430
like that.
It's really,

198
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,240
really hard to make things better and 
it's really,

199
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:35,570
really easy to make them worse.
And so that's another problem.

200
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:37,940
You get these big bureaucracies,
let's say,

201
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:42,941
and there hypothetically motivated by 
positive intentions and I would say 

202
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:44,420
hypothetically again,
because it takes an awful lot of work to

203
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:46,580
help someone straightened out.
It's no joke,

204
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,700
especially if they're in real trouble 
and they put in place these structures 

205
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:57,210
that are designed to help but they don't
ever evaluate them and they could easily

206
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:59,940
be making it worse.
So,

207
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,870
so I don't have a straightforward answer
to that question.

208
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,810
Um,
I think that.

209
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,300
Well that's,
that's the only answer I have.

210
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,230
Yeah.
Thank you.

211
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,200
Okay.
Yep.

212
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,490
Okay.
So that's the end of the show.

213
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,420
If you're in the first two rows,
you can stick around and get some 

214
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:21,420
pictures.
Otherwise,

215
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:21,670
a drive safe and yeah.

216
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Thank you.
