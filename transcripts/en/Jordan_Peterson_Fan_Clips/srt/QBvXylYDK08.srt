1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
And so look,
when someone stands up and says there's 

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,541
something wrong,
the first thing you should ask is what 

3
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:11,391
makes.
Why should I assume that you know what 

4
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:11,391
the hell you're talking about?
That's a good question.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:11,910
Well,

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,240
you investigate it and you find out 
whether or not the person does know what

7
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:21,720
they're talking about and on the issue 
that I'm describing to you tonight,

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,230
as far as I can tell,
I know what I'm talking about now.

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,380
People have been on my case about this 
in a very serious way for quite a long 

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,821
time and so far they haven't made any 
inroads into my arguments and most of 

11
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:36,450
the time they're too damn cowardly to 
debate me.

12
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:41,451
Which is also something that's really 
interesting because I've put out public 

13
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:41,451
calls constantly.
It's you.

14
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:46,010
You want a debate about gender and sex.
You just bring it on because that 

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,181
actually happens to be an area of 
expertise for me and I know the damn 

16
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:53,691
literature and if you want to come out 
and make your case that all the 

17
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:56,130
differences between men and women are 
socially constructed,

18
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:58,380
culturally constructed or that there's 
just.

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Or that they're just a personal whim,
which by the way is exactly what's 

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,660
written into the policies surrounding 
bill c 16.

21
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,830
Then you come out and make that case 
publicly and see how well it stands up 

22
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,610
and I know how well it'll stand up 
because that kind of thinking was 

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,911
defeated in the scientific realm back in
the 19 sixties in the universities and 

24
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:22,191
what that meant was that the radicals 
who wanted to keep promoting precisely 

25
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:25,560
that kind of view just circumvented the 
entire scientific process and started to

26
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:30,561
implement their demands for their 
particular viewpoint from a practical 

27
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:34,971
policy,
administrative and legislative 

28
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:35,700
perspective,
knowing full well that they had lost 100

29
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:38,100
percent on the empirical and the 
scientific front,

30
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,250
and now what they do instead is 
criticized the scientific endeavor 

31
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,880
itself because it failed to produce the 
results that they assumed would be the 

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,481
case.
So there's plenty that's rotten in the 

33
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:54,681
state of Denmark and I'm embarrassed to 
state that a tremendous amount of that 

34
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,070
stems from the universities and they're 
in bad shape.

35
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,270
Do not send your children to the 
humanities.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,100
Right?
They're corrupt.

37
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:02,630
They will.

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,540
Thank you.

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,760
They won't learn to think because the 
postmodernists don't believe in 

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,241
thinking,
they won't learn logic because the 

41
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:20,221
postmodernist believed that logic is one
of the tools that the oppressive 

42
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,600
patriarchy uses to sustain its 
oppressive patriarchy,

43
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,050
oppressive,
patriarchal nature.

44
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,020
They won't learn to write well.
That's because writing,

45
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,050
teaching people to write takes a 
tremendous amount of effort and perhaps 

46
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,050
they're not so much interested in 
teaching people to formulate their own 

47
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,341
thoughts precisely and carefully as they
are interested in producing tall like 

48
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,480
clones to go out and do their activist 
work,

49
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:45,650
which is precisely what they stayed on 
their website.

50
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:46,540
So,
you know,

51
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,660
things are not so pretty and,
and it's very embarrassing as a member 

52
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,070
of the academy and to come before a 
group of,

53
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,080
of public citizens and say you've been 
betrayed by your institutions,

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,060
higher learning.
It's sad,

55
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,340
it's sad and it's not good.

56
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,330
And you know,
you think,

57
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:05,440
well,
it's just the university,

58
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,790
it's just an ivory tower.
It's like,

59
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,960
think again,
man,

60
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,530
what happens in the university's happens
everywhere five years later.

61
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,090
So it's no mere ivory tower issue.
So.

62
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,300
Okay,
so a couple of weeks ago,

63
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,360
a couple of months ago I did this 
lecture and Vancouver called a leftwing 

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,220
case for free speech because you can 
actually make a left wing case for free 

65
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,220
speech pretty easily,
right?

66
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,220
It's like obviously some people have 
more influence and authority than others

67
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:38,221
and just as obviously it's harder for 
the people with less influence and 

68
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:41,911
authority to make their case known,
so clearly they need to be able to make 

69
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:45,481
their case.
So that's the left wing case for free 

70
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:45,481
speech.
It's fairly straight forward.

71
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:48,430
I thought it needed to be made because 
especially on the radical left,

72
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:53,431
people seem to have forgotten that free 
speech was actually their most what 

73
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:58,020
welcome friend and and enabled them to 
do whatever good things they did manage 

74
00:03:58,061 --> 00:03:59,680
to do over the last hundred years.

75
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,910
But I made a left wing case and so that 
was easy and reasonably entertaining and

76
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,530
you can watch that on youtube if you 
want.

77
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,950
And so tonight,
what I thought I do as a counterpart to 

78
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,741
that is layout what I believe might be 
some tenants for a viable 21st century 

79
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:16,180
conservatism and these are ideas that 
I'm playing with.

80
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,220
So I'm going to.
I wrote down about 12 of them.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,230
I don't know if we'll get through all of
them,

82
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:23,530
but we can.
We can start with a few and this is what

83
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,410
the Conservatives could be selling to 
the public.

84
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,680
Now what seems to me to be happening 
instead at the moment is as Kathleen 

85
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,300
Wynne flames out,
not nearly fast enough in my opinion.

86
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:33,340
Yeah.

87
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,700
The attitude among conservatives at the 
provincial party seems to be something,

88
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,170
well,
let's just go like go,

89
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,010
let's go cluster in a corner and not do 
anything too stupid because maybe she'll

90
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:54,011
burn yourself out so badly that will win
the next election and we won't have to 

91
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:56,090
do anything that will put us at risk.
And I'm not being cynical about that.

92
00:04:56,091 --> 00:04:59,090
I can understand the utility of that 
policy.

93
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:04,091
Although I think it's a bad policy and I
think it's a bad policy because there 

94
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:08,231
are some things that seriously need to 
be said about Kathleen Wynne in her 

95
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:09,800
government,
and I can tell you one noble aim for the

96
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:14,801
provincial conservatives for the next 
election would be to decimate the 

97
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:17,330
provincial liberals.
Not One should be left.

98
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:19,010
What's.
What's your popularity at right now?

99
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,520
Under 10 percent.
If she had a shred of integrity,

100
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,900
she would've already resigned.

101
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,470
So anyways,
there is a goal for the conservatives 

102
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,320
know liberal sitting after the 2018 
election that would send a message to 

103
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,791
the social justice warrior types.
It would also send a message to the 

104
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,271
centrists who should actually be 
occupying the positions of power in the 

105
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:44,380
Liberal Party.
That if you allow yourself to be taken 

106
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,301
over by a radical fringe,
you're going to get decimated at the 

107
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:49,691
Poles.
So you know that might be an exciting 

108
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:49,691
message to sell.
Young people.

109
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:53,890
Get out there and knock on some doors,
see if you can take the social justice 

110
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,181
warriors out at the top before,
before they do more damage than already 

111
00:05:58,181 --> 00:06:02,621
done.
She's got another year to do plenty of 

112
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:04,841
damage and you can be sure that she's 
going to do plenty more damage in that 

113
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:04,841
year,
so.

114
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:05,240
Okay.
What else?

115
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,550
Here's some things you might think about
if you're a conservative.

116
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,100
These things have become.
What would you say?

117
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,220
People are afraid to say them.
Here's the first one.

118
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,230
The fundamental assumptions of Western 
civilization are valid.

119
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,340
How about that?
You know it's not.

120
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,320
You think it's an accident.
Oh,

121
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,990
here's how you find out,
okay,

122
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,750
which countries do people want to move 
away from?

123
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,400
Hey,
not ours.

124
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,510
Which countries do?
People wanting to move two hours.

125
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,690
Guess what?
They work better and it's not because we

126
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:45,370
went around the world stealing 
everything.

127
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:49,150
We could get our hands on it because we 
got certain fundamental assumptions,

128
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:51,070
right?
Thank God for that.

129
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,790
After thousands and thousands of years 
of trying and because of that,

130
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:59,110
we've managed to establish a set of 
civilizations that are shining lights in

131
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:04,111
the world.
You know now you can be pretty damn 

132
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:04,150
filthy and still be a shining light in 
this world,

133
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:09,151
right?
Because if you look around the world at 

134
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,251
the state of governance in most places,
it's like the most pathological corrupt 

135
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:15,280
and vicious thugs rule,
and to stand out as an illuminated light

136
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:17,260
against that background is it so 
difficult,

137
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,440
but nonetheless,
you know we're as good as it's gone and 

138
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,780
unless we can come up with something 
better,

139
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:25,180
we should be very careful about messing 
around with that.

140
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,300
So why don't we start with the 
assumption that we're doing something 

141
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,300
right?
One of the things we're doing right,

142
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,621
for example,
is that we actually value the 

143
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:34,621
individual,
right?

144
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,120
The individual has intrinsic value in 
western societies.

145
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,300
Do you know how long it took people to 
formulate that as an idea and how 

146
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,510
unlikely that ideas that poor you,
you know,

147
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,380
useless,
powerless you with all your damn fault,

148
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,250
you're actually worth something.
You're worth something to the point that

149
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:54,190
the law has to respect you.
God,

150
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,880
we don't want to abandon that for some 
half witted collectivism,

151
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:02,881
which we're doing as rapidly as possible
because one of the things that 

152
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:06,130
characterizes the radical left types is 
they don't give a damn about you as an 

153
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,321
individual or about individuals at all.
You're black or you're white or you're 

154
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:13,510
Latino or you're transsexual,
you're homosexual or whatever.

155
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,210
You're a group,
you're a member of a group,

156
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,190
and the only thing that matters is the 
group.

157
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,340
Well,
I can tell you if the only thing that 

158
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,651
matters is the group,
you bloody well don't matter very much 

159
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:29,280
and then you got to ask yourself just 
exactly what sort of people are trying 

160
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,971
to set things up.
So it is that the individual doesn't 

161
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:33,100
matter very much.
Well,

162
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,220
it's the sort of people to whom the 
individual doesn't matter very much and 

163
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,001
I might suggest that you don't elect 
them and that when they attempt to take 

164
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:42,630
power that you do everything you can to 
stop.

165
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:42,950
No.

166
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,680
Okay,
so that's assumption number one,

167
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,050
the assumption number two,
peaceful social being is preferable,

168
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,260
isolation and to war in consequences 
justly and rightly demand some sacrifice

169
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:04,080
of individual impulsivity.
Idiosyncrasy,

170
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,840
okay,
so you want to live alone in the bush,

171
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,260
you're going to starve to death and 
beat,

172
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:11,250
and by black flies,
it's not a good solution.

173
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,460
Okay,
so you have to cooperate with other 

174
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,591
people and that means you can't get to 
be your whimsical self 100 percent of 

175
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,821
the time.
It means that most of you has to be 

176
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:25,290
sacrificed so that you can be 
approximately like everyone else.

177
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,850
Now,
that's a real sacrifice,

178
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,240
right?
It's,

179
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,000
it's a sacrifice of,
of.

180
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,390
It might even be a sacrifice of some of 
the unique qualities that everyone needs

181
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,610
from you.
Socialization costs,

182
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,740
but the advantage of it is,
well,

183
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,850
we get to exist.
Look,

184
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,880
we can all sit together in this hall and
no one has their hands around each 

185
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,630
other's throats and we're talking about 
serious things.

186
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,610
Okay man,
that's worth something.

187
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,820
And what is worth in parties?
You don't get to be whatever 

188
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,300
spectacularly colored creature you want 
to be all the time.

189
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,840
You have to do what you can to be normal
and predictable and it's not like normal

190
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:05,010
and predictable is the highest virtue 
because it's not and and being more than

191
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:10,011
normal and being and being unique and 
creative and contributing in our way is 

192
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:13,911
extraordinarily important,
but the fundamental point is is that 

193
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:17,330
social being requires the sacrifice of a
certain amount of individually 

194
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,870
idiosyncrasy and that's a fundamentally 
conservative claim.

195
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,620
It's like you should be.
You should do what everyone else does,

196
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,670
unless you have a really good reason to 
vary.

197
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:32,270
It's a good rule.
It's like you do what people have done 

198
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,340
throughout time.
You grow up,

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,120
you find a partner,
you establish a stable relationship,

200
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,280
you get a job,
you make yourself useful.

201
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,400
You have some children,
you do something productive and 

202
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,191
interesting with your spare time and you
try to act like a respectable human 

203
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:46,440
being.
That's what you do.

204
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,110
That's a conservative ethos and if 
you're.

205
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,230
If you have something spectacular about 
you that needs to be revealed to the 

206
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,750
world,
then break some rules,

207
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:55,770
man,
go right ahead.

208
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,520
I'm dead serious about that,
but most of the time you don't,

209
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,640
and even if you happen to be a special 
person and you might be 90 percent of 

210
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,291
you still isn't special,
so most of the time you're still going 

211
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,380
to be following the rules and the rules 
aren't there to oppress.

212
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,610
They're there to keep us at.
They're there to keep us away from each 

213
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,011
other's throats because human beings are
very warlike and we're very competitive 

214
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,260
and we're very aggressive and if we are 
fortunate enough to have woven together 

215
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:29,850
a social fabric that basically renders 
us peaceful and cooperative,

216
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,090
we should try disrupting that at our 
great peril.

217
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,940
Because the general rule for human 
existence,

218
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:45,750
throat the centuries has been turmoil 
and war and we don't have that here.

219
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,650
And so thank God for that and it's worth
a bit of a sacrifice.
