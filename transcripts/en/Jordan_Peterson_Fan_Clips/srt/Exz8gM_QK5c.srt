1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,040
So alright,
next borders are reasonable.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,160
How about that?
The law is the border that stops someone

3
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,460
from stealing your

4
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,970
laptop.
If it's an apple laptop,

5
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:29,971
well it's the sort of laptop that has 
social justice warrior would carry and 

6
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:33,861
then the social justice warrior is going
to be very irritated if you happen to 

7
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,500
purloin their laptop and then you might 
point out to them,

8
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:40,501
you know it's a border that protects you
from having that thing taken and they 

9
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:41,290
say,
well,

10
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,030
the borders should be open.
It's okay man,

11
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:48,031
no problem,
and you hand over that laptop right now 

12
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:50,340
and everything else you own too.
If you don't like borders and you can 

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,070
get rid of the damn walls in your house 
and you don't need doors on your bedroom

14
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:56,071
either and we can keep an eye on you 
whenever we want and so much for 

15
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:59,641
borders.
One of the things that really differs 

16
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,891
between liberals and conservatives 
between the left and the right is the 

17
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,100
right is in the right legs,
tight borders between things.

18
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,260
It's part of being conscientious at 
every level,

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,000
conceptually,
sexually,

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,830
familiarly,
provincially,

21
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,480
nationally.
The right says,

22
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:11,230
look,
let's keep.

23
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,530
Let's keep the borders between things 
pretty distinct and the left says,

24
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,830
yeah,
maybe not because some of those borders 

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,471
are in the wrong place and a little bit 
more free flow of information wouldn't 

26
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:23,110
be a bad thing,
and the thing is that right,

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,930
but so are the Conservatives and that's 
why you have to talk.

28
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:26,470
It's like,
well,

29
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:29,080
we've got some borders.
That's a good thing.

30
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:34,410
Maybe some of them need to be moved 
around a little bit and that's what the 

31
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,081
political dialogue is for,
but that doesn't mean that borders 

32
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:40,441
themselves are a bad idea.
They're a great idea because without 

33
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:44,431
borders,
everything Nash's into the same 

34
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:46,360
untenable state of undifferentiated 
chaos and you can't live in that.

35
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,110
And so the people who are trying to tear
down the borders conceptually,

36
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:55,111
politically and practically what they 
want is the chaos that that would bring 

37
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:57,790
the either want that or they're too 
foolish to know that their pursuits will

38
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:58,660
produce that.

39
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,040
So let's,
let's,

40
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,160
let's be a little bit clear that if you 
stand up and say,

41
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,600
yeah,
borders,

42
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,370
they're okay,
they've got their problems,

43
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:08,980
but they're okay.
That doesn't make you a a,

44
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,250
a bigot beyond redemption.
It just makes you someone with some 

45
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,811
sense and it's actually okay to be 
someone with some sense limits on 

46
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,160
immigration are also reasonable.
Well,

47
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:24,520
we need to figure out what those limits 
are and that's what the bloody political

48
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:29,521
dialogue is for,
but the fact that it should be limited 

49
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:29,521
to some degree is also reasonable.
Otherwise,

50
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:32,050
why not just open the borders and let 
everybody come in?

51
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:37,230
Well,
the reason you don't do that is because 

52
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,870
a complex system cannot tolerate 
extensive transformation over too short 

53
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:44,260
a period of time.
Now you want immigrants to come in,

54
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:49,261
especially if they're the sorts of 
immigrants who are likely to contribute 

55
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,950
properly to the success of your polity.

56
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,840
And lots of immigrants do that.
I mean,

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,910
I think the vast majority,
for example,

58
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:57,970
of entrepreneurs in the United States 
come from the Indian subcontinent.

59
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:58,930
So great.
You know,

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
bring them over.
They're highly educated,

61
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:06,121
they're extraordinarily productive.
They make lots of new businesses and 

62
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:07,480
then they pump money like back,
like mad back in India.

63
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,260
Good deal.
But that doesn't mean that we have.

64
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,110
Our arms are open to everyone 
immigration policy because it's complete

65
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:19,111
rubbish.
All that means is you're not thinking 

66
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:21,181
about it,
so when he hears a coded to that for 

67
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:23,641
conservatives,
here's something I've been thinking 

68
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:26,581
about this a lot lately.
It should not be assumed that citizens 

69
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:31,021
have societies that have not evolved 
functional individual rights predicated 

70
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,570
polities will hold values in keeping 
with such policies,

71
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,980
so we could say,
look,

72
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,340
there are a lot of countries in the 
world that are not governed well.

73
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,410
The vast majority of them,
right,

74
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,530
and they'd be not governed well forever,
and to me that means that there's 

75
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,421
something wrong with the values that are
held collectively by the people who've 

76
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:56,020
established those polarities.
Well,

77
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,200
you shouldn't be naive and assume that 
merely because you move them to a new 

78
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,891
country,
they're going to let their innate 

79
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:04,891
democratic longings,
Florida.

80
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,220
It doesn't work that way.

81
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,130
So if you stand up and say,
look,

82
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:15,380
you know,
let's be a little cautious.

83
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,300
Let's make sure that we don't transform 
our society so rapidly that we lose what

84
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,340
we have.
Let's be careful about that.

85
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,060
That doesn't mean that you're a morally 
reprehensible demon.

86
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,190
It just means that you're conservative 
and it's a reasonable position to hold,

87
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,860
so there's no sense in apologizing to it
for it.

88
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:39,010
Now,
that doesn't mean you get to like hide 

89
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,710
your bigotry under a mask of moral 
virtue.

90
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,740
You know,
the discrimination issue is quite clear 

91
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,080
as far as I'm concerned,
so that's associated with bigotry.

92
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,100
If you have two people who are applying 
for a job,

93
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,250
you should pick the one that's most 
qualified and not pay any attention to 

94
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,511
any of the other attributes of the 
person that have nothing to do with the 

95
00:04:58,511 --> 00:04:58,511
job.
Okay?

96
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,170
Right.

97
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,790
I think basically,
I think we figured that out in about 

98
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,600
1965 now.
We're not doing it perfectly,

99
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:14,601
you know,
but it's not that much later than 1965 

100
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,140
and our society particularly in Canada 
is pretty damn open.

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,320
You can come in here and if you work 
hard and if you're fortunate and you 

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,230
don't get sick and God smiles on you,
so to speak,

103
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,380
you can be successful.
There's still prejudice on reasonable 

104
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,531
prejudice and discrimination,
but our society is not as the radical 

105
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:34,731
egalitarian.
Equity promoters have it structurally 

106
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:34,731
racist,
bigoted,

107
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:36,690
and misogynistic.
No,

108
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,520
not only that,
just so you know,

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,680
there is a review.
There was a recent review published and 

110
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,951
I mean recent 2017.
Looking at that damn literature on 

111
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:47,370
unconscious bias and I knew the 
literature to begin with.

112
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,390
There is no evidence that unconscious 
bias can be measured properly,

113
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,140
not reliably.
There also no evidence whatsoever that 

114
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,991
if you do measure it and you can't very 
that it does any better job of 

115
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:04,031
predicting actual say bias and 
prejudice.

116
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Then just tests of attitude.
So the notion that our culture is 

117
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,621
somehow structurally misogynistic and 
racist and the reason for that is 

118
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:19,091
because of the unconscious bias of the 
monsters who are running it is is,

119
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,930
well maybe it's not wrong,
but I can tell you one thing about it.

120
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,040
It is not a scientifically justifiable 
proposition and that's what it's being 

121
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,301
passed off as.
And I placed that firmly at the feet of 

122
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:34,360
the social psychologists with social 
psychology happens to be a fairly 

123
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,400
corrupt disciplined by the way,
and the people who invented the Implicit

124
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Association test which measures 
unconscious bias because they have not 

125
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,400
come out publicly to the degree that 
they should have.

126
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,640
Instead,
our test,

127
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,150
which was for experimental purposes,
is being misused politically.

128
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:50,890
You know your damn judges now because of
federal five feet,

129
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,680
half to undergo mandatory unconscious 
bias training before they can sit on the

130
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:59,681
bench and so you don't think that's 
political reeducation is because you're 

131
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:02,390
not paying attention and there is zero 
evidence that it does what it's supposed

132
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:02,480
to.

133
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,480
And I would also recommend to all of you
if you happen to be in a workplace that 

134
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,871
introduces diversity training or 
unconscious bias training as a mandatory

135
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,020
requirement.
You tell them in no uncertain terms that

136
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,880
you are not participating in a process 
that deems you bigoted and misogynistic.

137
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,900
Without evidence of that being the case.
And if you trot off to the training,

138
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,940
then you've just agreed that that's who 
you are.

139
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,190
And believe me,
once you've agreed to that man,

140
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,370
you'll be agreeing to a bunch of things 
you don't want to agree soon afterwards.

141
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,850
So it's time just to put a stop to that.
None of that.

142
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,350
None of that unconscious bias retreading
especially not the mandatory type.

143
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,570
People should be paid so that they are 
able and willing to perform socially 

144
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,630
useful and desirable duties.
Okay.

145
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,740
So the radical leftists,
they react to me this way.

146
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,890
They say,
well you hold a position of privilege 

147
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,480
and power and I think first you don't 
know a god damn thing about being.

148
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,490
You have no idea how I got to my 
position of privilege and power and it 

149
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,970
was no birthright.
I can tell you that I was a small,

150
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,380
like thick glasses,
intellectual,

151
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,630
non.
What do you call that?

152
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,920
Athletic Child,
you know,

153
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:22,680
it was a year younger than my peers.
I suffered plenty of.

154
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,030
What would you say?
Trouble for my loud mouth and my 

155
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,030
intellect when I was growing up.
You know,

156
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,440
I had my struggles.
I'm not complaining about it.

157
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,590
The point is is that you can't attribute
privileged to a class of people.

158
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,460
You know when you can't attribute power 
to people who opt in to occupy a 

159
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,441
position of competence and authority,
either there's some possibility that 

160
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,920
they occupied that because they worked 
hard and were fortunate.

161
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,210
Let's not forget about that and had some
good social support and didn't have some

162
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,100
horrible disease.
Thank God,

163
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,460
but you can't just make the case that 
the position is there as a reward.

164
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,230
It's not there as far as a reward at 
all.

165
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:06,231
It's there as a consequence of the 
person offering something valuable to 

166
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:10,461
those who want to pay for it and the 
reason you pay for them isn't to reward 

167
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:14,301
them.
It isn't so that you give them a pat on 

168
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:14,301
the back and say,
well,

169
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:14,640
you're a good person and you know you 
deserve this position.

170
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,980
It's because you're saying to them,
produce.

171
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,730
We find what you're producing a value 
and so we're going to give you what you 

172
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,220
need in order to be motivated to keep 
doing it,

173
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,400
but it's not because we like you and 
it's not because we.

174
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,020
We respect your rights.
It has nothing to do with equity.

175
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,170
It's we're trying to get every God damn 
thing we can from you as fast as 

176
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,811
possible and we're going to pay you to 
do it and so people deserve their damn 

177
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:37,410
pay and the reason they deserve it isn't
because it's a reward.

178
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,650
It's because that's how you get 
productive people to do things that are 

179
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,491
difficult and time consuming and that 
perhaps they wouldn't do on their own 

180
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:48,480
accord to continue doing them so you can
benefit from it.

181
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,040
So the whole notion that,
you know,

182
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,090
we're awarding positions of privilege 
too,

183
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:59,210
oppressive patriarchal types.
It's like we just have to get rid of 

184
00:09:59,210 --> 00:09:59,210
that.
Enough of that.

185
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,810
That's nonsense.
It's absolute nonsense.

186
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,980
And the other thing too is,
you know,

187
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,350
it's only been 30,
40 years,

188
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,350
50 years since women had reliable birth 
control,

189
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:09,450
right?
And we're able to enter the workforce on

190
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:10,770
Moss.
I'll tell you man,

191
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,830
we've produced a cultural revolution in 
like 50 years.

192
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,010
Women are everywhere.
It's like how bloody fast you expect 

193
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,010
something like that to go.
And what makes you think that pushing it

194
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:21,810
really hard,
he's going to make it go any better.

195
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,130
I mean,
as far as I can tell,

196
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:26,130
we manage that transition about as well 
as we possibly could have.

197
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,250
We're still sorting out the details,
but the fact that you know this is 

198
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,091
coming very rapidly down the pipes,
the fact that half of our corporate 

199
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:39,111
board members are women is not 
indicative of the fact that we live in 

200
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:41,100
an unconsciously biased,
misogynistic,

201
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,230
patriarchal society.
Sorry,

202
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,120
wrong not correct and so we shouldn't be
allowing and this is happening very,

203
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:53,121
very rapidly.
You can be sure Kathleen Wynne is going 

204
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:53,340
to be putting this in his policies 
rapidly as she possibly can.

205
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,520
These equity demands to ensure that 
there is proportional representation of 

206
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,010
every gender,
every sex,

207
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:00,600
every race,
every ethnicity,

208
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,200
at every level of every organization.
It's like,

209
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:08,270
really?
We're going to do that by governmental 

210
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:08,270
Fiat.
It's like,

211
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,180
that's not a society I want to live in.
I tell you and I can.

212
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,270
I can I quite certain that if you lived 
in that society for any length of time,

213
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,580
you'd learned very rapidly that it isn't
a society that you'd want to be part of 

214
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:19,580
either.
