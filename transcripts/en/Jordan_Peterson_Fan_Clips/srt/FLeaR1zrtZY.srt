1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,300
One of the things that the Auschwitz 
guards used to do to the prisoners,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,080
and this is very telling,
so at Auschwitz there was a sign that 

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,550
said work will make you free.
It was a little joke.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,760
Not really a very funny joke,
you know,

5
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:18,900
it's the kind of joke that you have to 
be,

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,210
say tannic is the appropriate term to 
conceptualize and to dare to

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,230
due to state.
So when now our sweats prisoners came to

8
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:35,330
Auschwitz,
you know,

9
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:37,610
they're already pretty,
pretty rough shape.

10
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:42,611
They were in cattle cars.
They'd been separated from their 

11
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:42,611
families.
Everything had been taken from them.

12
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:45,080
They were transported for a long time.
They were standing up,

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,480
the kids were suffocating because there 
was no room in that,

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,950
you know,
it was so packed in there.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,100
They didn't have anything to eat.
There weren't any toilet facilities of 

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,610
any sort.
It was like you got rid of 20 percent of

17
00:00:55,611 --> 00:01:00,611
the people just transporting them,
you know the ones on the outside of the 

18
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:01,010
cars,
they froze to death because of course it

19
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:06,011
was cold and pretty nasty.
And then when they got to Auschwitz,

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,170
the guards used to have this game that 
they would play.

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,530
This is part of the work will set you 
free thing.

22
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,550
They would get a prisoner,
they take a prisoner who's already in 

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,100
pretty pretty rough shape and then have 
them carry a sack of wet,

24
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:26,060
sold 100 pounds from one side of the 
camp to the other.

25
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,100
And you know,
when you think of a camp,

26
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:29,840
you think of something like a football 
field,

27
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,000
you know,
maybe something that big fences around.

28
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,050
It's like,
no way man,

29
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,370
these were cities.
These were,

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,190
there were tens of thousands of people 
in these places.

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,440
So from one side of the camp compound to
the other,

32
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:41,990
that was a good hike and that wasn't bad
enough.

33
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:46,160
They had to get them to carry it back 
and put it in the same place.

34
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,270
Now that's poetic and it's malevolence.
You know,

35
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:01,791
what you're doing is you're harnessing 
the human compulsion to engage in useful

36
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:10,971
activity and demonstrating how 
absolutely futile that is despite its 

37
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:18,501
difficulty,
seems like a bad thing to do.

38
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,820
People need.
It's a parody of meaninglessness.

39
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:30,920
That's what that is.
And you know,

40
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:33,680
people need meaning in their lives 
because their lives are difficult.

41
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,020
And so the question is to what end 
should you devote your life?

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,620
And another question might be,
well,

43
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,720
does it matter?
Matter is an interesting word,

44
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:49,520
a because matter is matter,
but matter is also what matters.

45
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,260
And I would say that what matters is 
more real than matter.

46
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,620
At least that's how you act.
And then the question is,

47
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:02,621
well,
is there something you should be aiming 

48
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,460
at?
That's a good question.

49
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,800
That's the question of the meaning of 
life.

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,540
And you know,
one of the things that supposed to 

51
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,281
happen when you come to university is 
that that's the sort of question that 

52
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,040
should be addressed.
And as far as I can tell,

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,340
and this might just be my more cynical 
side,

54
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:21,190
what I see happening to university 
students generally speaking,

55
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:26,191
is that they come in clinging to the 
wreckage of their culture and floating 

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,820
with the pieces.
And those pieces are taken away by

57
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,130
professors who tell them that everything
can be deconstructed and no,

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,040
nothing has any real meaning.
And it's like when you're finally 

59
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,251
educated,
it's when you're floating out on the 

60
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:50,251
ocean and you've got nothing to stay 
afloat with.

61
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:50,710
It's like,
well then you're,

62
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,070
you're done.
And you congratulate.

63
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,180
And it's like,
I don't see that as useful.

64
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,290
Quite the contrary.
So let me tell you a story.

65
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,310
The first thing I'm going to propose to 
you,

66
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:26,311
and we'll talk about this a lot,
is that you inhabit a story that the 

67
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:28,570
framework through which you look at the 
world is actually a story.

68
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:33,460
And here's the story.
The story is you're somewhere and you're

69
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:36,550
going somewhere and even that can be 
conceptual or whatever.

70
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:38,890
It's the,
but there's a gradient between where you

71
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:43,891
are and what were you aiming at,
which means no more really than you're 

72
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:43,891
doing something.
Well,

73
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:48,091
you're sitting there and hypothetically 
you're aiming for something better and 

74
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:51,160
so you're in a state of insufficiency.
Oh,

75
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:56,161
is the DNS insufficiencies change?
And then you're trying to rectify the 

76
00:04:56,651 --> 00:05:01,651
insufficiency and you presume that your 
current state is less preferable to the 

77
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:05,701
state that you're aiming at.
And then the way that you bring those 

78
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:09,310
two together is sometimes you can do it 
through thinking,

79
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,860
but fundamentally you do it through 
action.

80
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,200
You do it through acting in the world.
And so that's sort of,

81
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,130
that's sort of the answer in some sense 
to the mind body problem.

82
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,820
You have a conceptual structure,
but when you implement it,

83
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,230
you're,
you're implementing it,

84
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,440
not abstract,
but you're implementing it through 

85
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,440
action.
And so that's,

86
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,550
that's the basic story.
It's not a very interesting story,

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,220
but it's the framework through which you
view the world.

88
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:38,221
So it's a value laden framework,
otherwise you wouldn't be able to act 

89
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,840
and you wouldn't know what to look at.
So it's a value laden framework.

90
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,300
You look at the world through a value 
laden framework.

91
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,200
So then we might say,
well,

92
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:46,480
what is the optimal Value Laden 
framework?

93
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,370
That's what we're going to try to figure
out.

94
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Now I told you about the war that went 
on between the communists in the West 

95
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,620
and how that obsessed me.
And so one of the things that I really 

96
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,760
wondered about was what was this just an
arbitrary thing?

97
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,320
You know,
like did the Communists,

98
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:09,800
they had some axioms and we had some 
axioms and if you're a moral relativist,

99
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,580
you might say,
well,

100
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,670
who's to say which set of axioms are 
better?

101
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Or even who's to claim that?
You could say that a set of actions one 

102
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,650
set is better than another.
That's a moral relative,

103
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:24,350
this claim and Puno Fair enough.

104
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,540
So I thought,
well maybe this is just an arbitrary 

105
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,611
thing and it's going to be settled by 
force because that's how you settle an 

106
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:41,391
arbitrary claim between two competing 
systems where there's no room for 

107
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:42,810
negotiation.
So I thought about that for a long time.

108
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:47,811
I wanted to know what the roots were of 
the Marxist system and what the roots 

109
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,950
were of the Western system.
And what I surmised was that the western

110
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:55,680
system was actually something that 
evolved.

111
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Whereas the communist system was a 
rationalist construction that was 

112
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,230
imposed and they weren't the same thing.
And so then I wondered,

113
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,500
well,
what's western culture grounded in and 

114
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,250
is there any reason to assume that 
that's real in any sense?

115
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,850
And so that's what took me into this 
study of the underlying stories.

116
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,520
The fundamental stories upon which our 
culture,

117
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,980
I believe is based in some of those are 
very old.

118
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,650
I'm going to tell you a Mesopotamian 
story.

119
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:28,470
It's one of the oldest stories we know 
I'm going to tell you an Egyptian story.

120
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,620
Those are sources of our culture and I 
think those stories are grounded in much

121
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:39,621
older traditions and I think they refer 
to something real actually real.

122
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,050
Now,
I already told you that there are 

123
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,881
different ways of conceptualizing real 
and that my initial hypothesis,

124
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,770
presumption,
axiom you might say,

125
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:57,771
is that pain is the most real,
and the reason I believe that is because

126
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:02,370
that's how people act.
Now you can criticize that.

127
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,390
You can certainly come up with an 
alternative conceptual framework which 

128
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,840
the scientists have because they believe
that the most real thing is mattered.

129
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,520
Maybe we need more than one set of tools
to operate in the world.

130
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,260
It's possible.

131
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,220
So now I want to tell you what I think 
the fundamental constituent elements are

132
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:34,831
of stories,
and one of the things that I hope is 

133
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:40,381
that this knowing this will make you 
immunize,

134
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,950
immunize you against ideology.
And the reason,

135
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,870
because I believe that ideology is our 
fragmentary metanarratives narratives,

136
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,430
and they have their power because 
they're grounded in the Meta narrative,

137
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:59,431
but they only tell of the story,
but they have power because they're 

138
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:02,871
grounded in the fundamental narrative.
And so here's the fundamental narrative 

139
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:07,200
as far as the characters,
let's say we're going to say that people

140
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:11,430
are prone to characterize the world or 
social primates.

141
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:16,431
We're social cognitive primates,
so we tend to see the world through the 

142
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:20,181
lens of a social creature and so and 
partly because we're concerned with 

143
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,320
acting in the world and the world is 
mostly other people.

144
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,590
Then we conceptualize the ground of that
structure for action in 

145
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,250
characterological terms.

146
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,330
So the most fundamental reality is chaos
and chaos is what you don't understand 

147
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:45,030
it all.
You can't even conceptualize it.

148
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:50,590
You,
you come into contact with it in bits 

149
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,680
and pieces.
When the twin towers fell,

150
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:56,520
when the twin towers fell,
chaos reigned for a few days.

151
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,970
Everyone was shellshocked and that was 
chaos.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,650
And Chaos is what you experience.
When your story falls apart,

153
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,090
and that's a descent to the underworld.
That's chaos.

154
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,330
And basically you live in order,
in chaos and order is where when you do 

155
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,250
what you think you should do,
what you want to have happen happens,

156
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,550
that's ordered,
that's explored territory and chaos is 

157
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,761
when you do what you're supposed to do 
to get what you want and it doesn't 

158
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:30,291
happen.
And then that place that you're 

159
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:30,291
magically in.
When that happens,

160
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:34,251
that's chaos and it has different depths
you could say it reaches all the way to 

161
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:38,991
hell,
and that usually happens when your life 

162
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:41,991
falls apart very badly,
and you're down in that chaos and you 

163
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:45,981
realized that it was your fault and that
you did something wrong and that you 

164
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:50,430
knew it and you ignored it.
That's the worst form of chaos.
