1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,510
People ask what the meaning of life is 
and it seems to me that meaning is 

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,980
proportionate to the adoption of 
responsibility.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:16,230
You know,
like let's say you have a little sister 

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,230
who's like three,

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,140
you're going to take care of her.
Like questioning whether that's a good 

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,480
idea just seemed stupid.
You know what I mean?

7
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:28,310
It just doesn't seem like the right kind
of question.

8
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:33,311
It's like,
well obviously self evidently let's say 

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,980
that's what you do and you find it 
meaningful.

10
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:39,210
It's like probably,
you know,

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,610
interacting with a little kid when we 
had,

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,850
when I had little kids,
you know,

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,900
when they were like two or under,
we took them out to see their relatives 

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,360
and they were older people and you know,
they watched that two year old like,

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,890
like it was a fire,
you know,

16
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,820
every second that that little kid was in
the room,

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,710
every single adult was focused on,
focused on,

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,630
on him or her.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:07,930
Yeah.

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,230
That's something that people attended to
and that's a source of meaning.

21
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:13,870
And what else is a meaningful?
Well,

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,970
your family relationships are meaningful
to you and maybe the responsibility that

23
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:21,740
you adopt as,
as a friend that,

24
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:26,741
that seems meaningful.
Maybe your decision to pursue a 

25
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:28,640
particular career and be of some utility
in society,

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,030
you know,
part of that's governed by your desire 

27
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,190
to establish some security and get 
ahead.

28
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:39,191
It's fine,
but you're also playing an integral role

29
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:43,490
in the maintenance of the structure that
supports you.

30
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:48,491
And my observation has been that in my 
clinical practice is that people just 

31
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:50,720
have a hell of a time if they don't 
have,

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,360
if they don't slot in somewhere,
you know,

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,520
you know,
you think I got to go to work at nine in

34
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:57,590
the morning and you know,
I've got this rigid schedule.

35
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:58,040
It's like

36
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,400
it's probably a good idea to be grateful
for that because of.

37
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:07,401
What I have noticed is that if people 
pull out from those externally 

38
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:10,330
scaffolded systems,
they drift,

39
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,880
they get depressed,
they get anxious,

40
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,770
they don't know what to do with 
themselves.

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,980
You know,
they're kinda like sled dogs with no 

42
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,050
slab and we're kinda like sled dogs as 
far as I can tell.

43
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:22,090
Beasts of burden.
Like we need a load,

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,770
man,
we need a load,

45
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,470
and the question is what,
what sort of low do you need?

46
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,920
And here's why I think we need,
we need that.

47
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,990
You know,
there's,

48
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,530
I've been thinking about how to figure 
out what's real for a long time and 

49
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,370
because I'm an existentialist,
I'm operating under the presupposition 

50
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,270
that you can tell what people believe by
watching what they,

51
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,970
how they act.
I don't care what they say,

52
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,660
I don't care what their statements are 
about their view of reality because the 

53
00:02:57,471 --> 00:03:02,471
correlation,
the relationship between that and their 

54
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,501
actual actions is not certainly not 
perfect and sometimes it doesn't even 

55
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:10,210
exist.
One thing I've noticed is that people,

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,960
no one argues with their own pain.
Everyone who hurts acts as if they 

57
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,340
believe that pain is real.

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,900
So we could say the ultimate reality is 
pain.

59
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,370
That's how people act.
It's in keeping with the claims of many 

60
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,820
religious traditions.
You know,

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,260
the Jews are always recollecting past 
pain.

62
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,070
I mean the Christian God is crucified 
person.

63
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:47,950
I mean there's a fair bit of pain there 
for the Buddhists.

64
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,440
The fundamental maximum is that life is 
suffering.

65
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,040
And I'm,
it seems to me that there's a 

66
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,361
metaphysical claim there no metaphysical
claim is that pain is real.

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Now,
of course it depends on what you mean by

68
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:08,060
real,
but people act as if their pain is real.

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,120
So that's a good place to start.
Now that poses a problem.

70
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,160
Life is a pain,
life is suffering,

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,020
let's say.
And why is that?

72
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
Well,
it's because you can be broken,

73
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,300
hurt and destroyed.
And so that seems pretty self evident 

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,950
and worse,
you know it.

75
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,380
And that makes people unique.
Like that's our selfconsciousness,

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,600
right?
That's really what separates us in some 

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,941
sense from other creatures.
I mean other creatures have some self 

78
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:55,991
consciousness like a chimp can learn to 
recognize itself and a mirror and 

79
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,200
soaking a dolphin.
But you know,

80
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:59,380
that's pretty,
that's pretty bare bones,

81
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,770
selfconsciousness,
you know,

82
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,490
real self consciousness is the knowledge
of your borders and not only in space 

83
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,750
but in time.
And as far as I can tell,

84
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,570
human beings are the only creatures that
have discovered the future.

85
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,210
And that's really good because we can 
plan for the future,

86
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:22,211
but it's really bad because you know the
future is finite and that's like that's 

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,360
a big shock to the old system and it's 
the existential burden that everyone 

88
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:32,280
bears and its associated integrity with 
suffering.

89
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,230
And so then you think,
well,

90
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:37,590
life is suffering and it's finite and 
that's part of the suffering.

91
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,480
That's part of what you makes you 
question the value of existing and maybe

92
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:44,640
the value of existence itself.

93
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,730
So then what do you have to,
were used as a weapon against that?

94
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,810
Well,
you know,

95
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:52,820
we talked a little bit about 
responsibility.

96
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,990
Now it seems to work,
you know,

97
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,360
the,
the amount of responsibility that you 

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,360
adopt

99
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,250
with really in relationship to things 
seems to increase your meaningful 

100
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:10,390
engagement.
And you might say,

101
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:15,100
well what's the most meaningfully 
engaged activity?

102
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:20,101
And you might say,
well how about little reduction in the 

103
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:21,610
old suffering?
No.

104
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,680
So you live your life so that you're not
causing undue pain,

105
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,320
especially pointless pain.
That would be good.

106
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,780
And maybe you could even be more useful 
than that.

107
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:35,680
And you could figure out some ways that 
some suffering years,

108
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:40,681
other people's both,
if you're really hitting a home run,

109
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,830
maybe you can figure out some way that 
some of that can be rectified and that 

110
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,480
seems to be meaningful in and of itself.
I mean,

111
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:52,180
if it's pain that makes you doubt the 
meaning of life,

112
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:57,181
which is perfectly reasonable,
then the cessation of pain,

113
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,970
the cessation of suffering,
the minimization of suffering as a 

114
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,490
logical corollary should be the proper 
medication.

115
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,210
And so I would say that means that 
there's some mode that you can conduct 

116
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,990
yourself in that makes you a good person

117
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,670
and

118
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,340
part of being a good person is to 
alleviate suffering.

119
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,950
And

120
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
I don't think you get to question that 
actually.

121
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:34,260
If,
if the suffering itself is what's making

122
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:39,261
you question the validity of your life,
then you can't also say that the 

123
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:42,630
cessation of that is not useful.
I mean you can,

124
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:44,670
but it's completely incoherent.
You can.

125
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,770
You can claim incoherent things if you 
want.

126
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:57,210
So then I would say these distilled 
stories that I'm talking about,

127
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,670
the stories that are written by great 
authors,

128
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,320
I'm particularly fond of Dostoevsky 
whose,

129
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,480
whose works are he's head and shoulders 
above anyone I've ever read in terms of

130
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,530
writers of fiction.
He deals with the hardest questions that

131
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:26,531
human beings face and he,
he has characters on both sides of the 

132
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:31,070
argument and there they really lay out 
the arguments.

133
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:36,071
It's not like Dostoevsky and all.
He has got a belief and so he has a 

134
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:37,010
character and that character has his 
beliefs.

135
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,040
And that character always wins the 
arguments.

136
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,450
It's that doesn't happen.
And the Dostoyevsky novel at all,

137
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,540
he sets up a character and then he sets 
up like three or four antagonists and 

138
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,470
those antagonists,
they're not straw men,

139
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,810
they're like iron giants.
They just stomp his,

140
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,700
his protagonist,
you know.

141
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:57,200
And the whole thing is a war between 
these different conceptions of being.

142
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,850
It's amazing to see.
It's amazing to read.

143
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,330
Um,

144
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,730
so you distill these stories,
great authors distill stories,

145
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,230
great storytellers distill stories,
and we have stories that are very,

146
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:16,830
very,
very,

147
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:20,130
very old.
Those are usually religious stories.

148
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:23,580
Of one form or another particular be 
fairy tales because fairy tales,

149
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,920
some people have traced fairytales back,
you know,

150
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,040
more than 10,000
years and so they're part of an oral 

151
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,711
tradition and oral traditions can last 
for tens of thousands of years and you 

152
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,650
know,
it's a story that's been told for 10,000

153
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:41,520
years is a funny kind of story.
It's like people have remembered it and,

154
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,210
and obviously modified it.
It's like the game of telephone,

155
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:50,211
you know,
where I tell you something and you 

156
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:50,211
whispered to the person next to you and 
so on.

157
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:52,560
It's like a game of telephone that's 
gone on for you know,

158
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,990
thousand generations and all that's left
is what people remember and maybe they 

159
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:03,771
remember what's important because you 
tend to remember what's important and 

160
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:04,050
didn't necessarily the case that you 
know,

161
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,630
what the hell it means.
You don't know what music means,

162
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,590
but you know that's a stop you from 
listening to it.

163
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,200
You don't know.
Generally speaking,

164
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,650
what a movie that you see or a book that
you read means not.

165
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:21,651
If it's profound,
it means more than you can understand 

166
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:21,810
because otherwise why read it.
