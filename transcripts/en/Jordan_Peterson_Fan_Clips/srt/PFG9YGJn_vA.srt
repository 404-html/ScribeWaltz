1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,440
The basic narrative of human struggle,
his oppressor versus oppressed,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,340
we use category structures,
can constrain that infinite number of 

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,911
interpretations because the basic 
narrative is an oppressor versus 

4
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:17,841
oppressed.
We choose those narratives that serve 

5
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:18,060
our function as old pressers,

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,880
so it's deeply cynical but credible,
you know,

7
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:33,051
and you can say if you're not naive that
people are motivated by power and that 

8
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,900
our interpretations of the world can be 
self serving.

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,930
I mean we do want to serve ourselves 
after all because otherwise we die and 

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,131
so and we are centered in one place and 
so we can't see everything and we're 

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,180
biased.
So.

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,350
So there is the probability that the way
that we look at the world will be 

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,911
tainted by narrow self interest and 
maybe even tainted by ingroup interests 

14
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,800
beyond narrow,
individual self interested.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,530
We know this is true,
but it's also not all bad.

16
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:11,531
You know,
like we a good person takes care of his 

17
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:11,531
or her family.
What does that mean?

18
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:14,080
It means you prefer your family.
Outsiders,

19
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:17,360
you were going to get rid of that.
It's a form of prejudice.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,190
Like it really is like your choice of 
sexual partners,

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,140
a form of prejudice,
right?

22
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:27,170
I mean maybe it should be distributed in
an egalitarianism manner.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Hey,
that would be a lot funnier if it isn't 

24
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:35,800
a possibility like in,
in,

25
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,710
in,
in,

26
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,850
in Huxley's brave new world,
that was the rule you,

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,910
you shared yourself with whoever asked 
because it was rude not to and you know 

28
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,010
what it is actually rude not to.
It's seriously rude.

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,490
Now,
is that something you want to take away 

30
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,691
from people?
You want that to be distributed in an 

31
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:55,691
egalitarianism fashion.

32
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,410
How prejudiced you when you choose 
someone to sleep with you choose that 

33
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,810
person and not everyone else.
It's the ultimate in prejudice.

34
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,590
If you say,
well,

35
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,150
that's not prejudicial.
Oh yes,

36
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:12,151
it is.
Usually go for the most attractive 

37
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,180
partner you can find.
Usually go for the healthiest partner.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,780
You go for the best person you can find 
who can tolerate you.

39
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,510
It's prejudicial in every possible way 
so well,

40
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:28,000
so okay,
so your self serving and you construct a

41
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:33,001
view of the world that serves those 
selfserving causes and some of that has 

42
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:35,800
to do with power.
Fair enough.

43
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,170
That doesn't mean it all has to do with 
power

44
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,780
though.

45
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,810
It means that some of it has to do with 
power.

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,080
It's like racism.
People are kind of racist or maybe 

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,290
people prefer their ingroup.
It's not that easy.

48
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,710
Or maybe people prefer the familiar to 
the novel.

49
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,150
You know that I eat that the social 
psychologists have come up with implicit

50
00:02:57,151 --> 00:03:00,430
association test that measures 
unconscious bias.

51
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,640
We don't know what the hell that 
measures the people who invented that 

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:05,640
bloody thing.
They know.

53
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,230
We don't know what it measures.
They know it's not reliable.

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,500
They know it's not valid enough to be 
used as an individual diagnostic 

55
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,620
instrument.
That's technically the case.

56
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,910
They also know that you can't train 
people out of their unconscious biases 

57
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,200
because there is not much difference 
between unconscious bias and 

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,640
instantaneous perception,
but they don't really care.

59
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,760
I've.
I've written to Missouri and Banerji.

60
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,000
He's one of the inventors of the IAT 
several times saying,

61
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,180
how about you come out in public and say
what you already know?

62
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,390
Which is that people are misusing your 
damn test.

63
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,030
Silence.
Well,

64
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:48,031
that's partly because her discipline,
social psychology is a corrupt 

65
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:51,061
discipline as the social psychologists 
have discovered over the last four 

66
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:51,850
years,
can be turning themselves inside out,

67
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:54,040
trying to rectify which they haven't

68
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,670
anyways,

69
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,160
we're giving the devil his due.
There's an infinite number of 

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,131
interpretations of the world and it's 
highly probable that you'll lay a self 

71
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:06,130
serving one on top of it.
Yes,

72
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,260
and also that will serve the interests 
of your group,

73
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,120
however you define that,
yes,

74
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,060
but it only accounts for a fraction of 
your behavior.

75
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,430
There's all sorts of other things at 
work as well,

76
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,540
and you don't get to reduce all human 
motivations to one motivation power,

77
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,010
and then you might also ask,
well,

78
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:26,011
why would you want to reduce all human 
motivations to power it so you can use 

79
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:30,090
power?
That's why you can justify the use of 

80
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,390
power.
That's force.

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,730
You don't have to engage in civilized 
debate.

82
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,410
You don't have to give a damn about the 
facts,

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,560
especially if you're not a postmodernist
because you don't believe in facts 

84
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,560
anyways.
And you might ask,

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,720
well,
why don't you?

86
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,830
Hey,
I'm not kidding.

87
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,160
I'm not kidding.
Postmodernists don't believe in facts.

88
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,430
They believe that the idea of fact is 
part of the power game that's placed 

89
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,440
played by the white dominated male 
patriarchy to impose the theoretical 

90
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,230
structure of the Patriarchy on the 
oppressors.

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,110
It's like I'm not making this stuff up.
It's embedded,

92
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,040
right?
In theory,

93
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:08,041
all you have to do is read it and you 
find this out so they don't believe in 

94
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:12,841
facts.
While facts would constrain the use of 

95
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:12,880
power,
at least that's how it looks to me.

96
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,320
Okay,
so fine.

97
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:21,321
We gave the devil his due.
There's an infinite number of 

98
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,601
interpretations and you're likely to use
bias compression algorithms on the world

99
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,940
and they're likely to be biased in your 
favor.

100
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,680
True,

101
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,000
but

102
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,650
only partly true.

103
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,200
And the difference between India log and
the thinker is that a thinker knows the 

104
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,491
difference between things that are only 
partly true and things that are 

105
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:48,420
completely true.
Things are complicated.

106
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:52,290
Like I like to think everything is as 
complicated as a military helicopter.

107
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,070
You have to like.
I think it's eight hours of maintenance 

108
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,600
to keep those things in the air for one 
because they don't fly there rocks.

109
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,900
They plummet.
It's really hard to keep them in the air

110
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,230
and they're full of parts and if you 
don't know all those parts,

111
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:09,830
you don't go in there and monkey about 
with them because they just wreck it and

112
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,280
that's just a helicopter,
like everything is way more complicated 

113
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,730
than the helicopter,
so you don't just go muck about in there

114
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:19,580
hoping you're going to make it better.
That isn't how it works.

115
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,260
You need to be competent.

116
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,290
Alright,
so look,

117
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,030
here's where the postmodernists are 
wrong.

118
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:29,210
I think there's three places and they're
serious errors.

119
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,530
The first is that there is an infinite 
number of interpretations,

120
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:36,310
but there is not an infinite number of 
viable interpretation.

121
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:40,220
So there's a very finite number of 
viable interpretations and I don't think

122
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:43,520
that this is theory.
I think that game theorists have already

123
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:48,521
demonstrated this to some degree and 
it's going to be built into AI systems 

124
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:48,521
very rapidly.
Okay?

125
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:50,420
So what are the constraints?
Okay?

126
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:55,421
First of all,
you can't have an interpretation that 

127
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:55,610
leads to immediately to your death or 
your dad.

128
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,080
Now,
if you want to be dead,

129
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,910
that's fine,
but if you don't want to be,

130
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,880
then you got a lot of limited options,
right?

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You don't get to run naked across an 
eight lane freeway at night blindfolded 

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,550
because probably you'll be dead.
That's a bad interpretation.

133
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:16,030
Okay,
so you might say because you're fragile 

134
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,191
and vulnerable and mortal,
that there's a limited number of ways 

135
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:20,360
that you can look at the world that 
don't result in,

136
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,110
let's say death or serious damage or 
agony.

137
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,270
That's a bad thing.
Agony is a bad thing.

138
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:31,271
Most people agreed on that.
So you're constrained by pain and 

139
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:34,781
anxiety.
At least your interpretations are 

140
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:38,111
constrained by pain and anxiety and you 
know you can make pain worse or better 

141
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:41,180
by thinking about it to some degree,
but only to some degree.

142
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,560
When push comes to shove,
pain is your master.

143
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,760
Okay?
So that's a big constraint.

144
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,630
That's a big,
big constraint.

145
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Well,
but the constraints are worse than that 

146
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:55,980
because not only do you not

147
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,380
get to have an interpretation of the 
world that produces anxiety and 

148
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,451
suffering right now,
but you don't get to have an 

149
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,650
interpretation of the world that if you 
iterate it across time produces pain and

150
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:11,651
suffering and so that's,
that's a big problem because there's 

151
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:15,431
lots of.
You could go out tonight and get 

152
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:16,540
yourself blind drunk on cocaine and 
sleep with six hookers and you know,

153
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,950
maybe that maybe that'd be a good night.
You know,

154
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,230
you might not think about it being so 
good tomorrow,

155
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:25,220
but then maybe your dad have aids in a 
year or maybe you're addicted to cocaine

156
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:27,590
or maybe you're a street alcoholic or 
whatever.

157
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,920
It's like as an iterable game,
that's a downhill.

158
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,590
And the thing is you play iterated 
games.

159
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,620
You don't play one,
you play iterated games and so your 

160
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,591
interpretation of the world has to be 
one that will sustain multiple 

161
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:44,801
iterations across time because you have 
to worry about 40 year old you and 60 

162
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,370
year old you.

163
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,980
And that's a big problem.
That's a lot of used,

164
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:53,981
stretched over a long period of time and
it's worse than that because it's not 

165
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:57,821
just you,
it's like you and your right and not 

166
00:08:57,821 --> 00:09:02,151
only so.
Not only do you have to take care of 

167
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:02,910
yourself now in a manner that allows you
to take care of yourself when you're 40,

168
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,150
you have to take care of yourself now in
a manner that takes care of you when 

169
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,921
you're 40 so that other people are happy
to have you around now and continually 

170
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,040
so that they'll cooperate and compete 
with you in a positive way,

171
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,250
and so that's getting ridiculously 
complicated.

172
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,140
It's not just you now when you in the 
future,

173
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:27,141
it's you surrounded by other people 
doing the same thing now and in the 

174
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:28,080
future and there's a lot of other 
people.

175
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,330
It can even just be you and your family.

176
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,540
You know,
like like the psychopathic burglar mob 

177
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,300
that's just not going to go so well,
right?

178
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:40,800
Other people are going to object and the
world's going to object and so fine.

179
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,810
There's an infinite number of 
interpretations,

180
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,720
but it doesn't mean there's an infinite 
number of viable interpretations.

181
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,340
In fact,
there are hardly any,

182
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,280
there are hardly any playable games.
Now,

183
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,570
piaget,
piaget,

184
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:54,060
the developmental psychologist who's a 
very smart guy,

185
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,700
he pointed out something very 
interesting.

186
00:09:56,701 --> 00:10:01,701
He said,
imagine you ran a set of iterated games 

187
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,121
as a competition and in one iterated 
game the rule was you bloody well do 

188
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,680
what I tell you to.
And the other one is,

189
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,830
well,
we'll all get together and decide how 

190
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:12,830
we're going to do this.
Okay,

191
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:12,830
now we run the competition.
Uh,

192
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,190
Piaget's claim is you do what I tell you
fails.

193
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,290
And the reason for that is I have to 
impose force in order to keep you 

194
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:21,390
cooperating.

195
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,800
And the imposition of forest is a cost.
It's an efficiency cost.

196
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,370
And across time that efficiency cost is 
going to multiply.

197
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:34,371
And the equilibrated state solution,
which is the one where we all agree it 

198
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:38,721
wins.
Now that's worth thinking about and you 

199
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:38,721
can think about that locally.
So you've got,

200
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:43,641
you're trying to organize your family,
you have a little family conference 

201
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:44,640
about who's doing what in the household 
and what do you.

202
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:47,730
If you want peace and harmony and an 
iterated game,

203
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,140
you get everybody to say,
well,

204
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:54,000
here's the tasks and we have to be done.
People have to rely on that and then you

205
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:54,300
say,
well,

206
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:59,301
which tasks would you do?
You have to some how about you and you 

207
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:02,040
know which task would you do and 
everybody agrees and then you say,

208
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:07,041
well,
unless you can come up with a better 

209
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,041
solution,
that's the one we're going to go with,

210
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,060
and then people can be a little 
resentful and angry about the conditions

211
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:14,061
of existence where they have to work,
but they can't really blame that on 

212
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:15,810
anyone else and maybe that's the best 
solution you can come up with.

213
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,390
And that was piaget's idea of the 
equilibrium state.

214
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:23,391
It was like it's a voluntary agreement 
that can be iterated across time.

215
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,720
That works at multiple levels of social 
organization.

216
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,240
Man,
that's a serious,

217
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:32,400
serious,
serious set of constraints.

218
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,990
And Piaget,
by the way,

219
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:37,800
was looking for a way to reconcile 
science and religion.

220
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,980
He was looking for biological origin to 
morality and he thought he found it in 

221
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,570
the idea of the equilibrium state and 
it's even deeper than that.

222
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:50,571
So imagine this equilibrium state ideas.
Actually there's something to it that if

223
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:55,240
you set the the state of property,
it will iterate across time so long that

224
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:57,400
it becomes a permanent part of the 
environment.

225
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,360
Hierarchy is exactly.
That's exactly what a hierarchies.

226
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,100
Hierarchies are $350,
million years old.

227
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,290
They are not the patriarchal invention 
of white European Christian males in the

228
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:13,030
last 300 years.
There are $350 million years old.

229
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,240
They're stable,
they're stable solutions to this 

230
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,331
iterated game problem and they've been 
around so long that we're actually 

231
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:24,361
adapted to the and that's part of the 
reason we have archetypal 

232
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:24,880
representations of the social structure.

233
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,420
So and then we also have archetypal 
representations of the relationship of 

234
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,901
the individual to the social structure.
Your job as an individual in 

235
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:38,710
relationship to the social structure is 
to embody the social structure,

236
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,430
but also to serve as as its eyes and its
mouth.

237
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,400
So that can update itself wouldn't 
necessarily.

238
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,640
So you take on the mantle of your 
father,

239
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,010
let's say,
but he's dead.

240
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,250
He's the path he can't see.
You can see,

241
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,670
so you take the structure that's already
there and you modify it where it's 

242
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,761
necessary and that modification process 
is necessary or the state becomes too 

243
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:07,711
static and collapses and that's why the 
state has to be subordinate to the 

244
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,491
individual and that's what Western 
culture has discovered and we can't just

245
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:13,120
let it go.
That's the idea.

246
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:16,720
The logos,
that's a big idea and you'd want to live

247
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:21,721
somewhere where you want to live 
somewhere where the individual is 

248
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:21,721
subordinate to the state.
It's like,

249
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:22,090
hey,
go right ahead.

250
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:23,620
There's lots of places like that,
man,

251
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,710
emigrate go there.
Ninety percent of the world's countries 

252
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,890
are like that.
If you want to live like that,

253
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,600
man,
go find out what it's like.

254
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,470
You don't see immigration going there,
that's for sure.
