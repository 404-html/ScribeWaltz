1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,130
And you know,
because of that you all think,

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:03,630
well,
you're in control of yourself,

3
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:06,720
but don't be thinking that that's just 
not right.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,360
I mean if you look at how the brain is 
structured,

5
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,190
for example,
the Hypothalamus,

6
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:13,150
which is a really important part of the 
brain,

7
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:18,151
it basically,
it basically establishes the framework 

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,540
of reference and the actions,
the framework of reference within which,

9
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:25,800
and the actions you take in order to 
fulfill basic biological needs.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,980
So the hypothalamus makes you thirsty 
and the hypothalamus makes you hungry 

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,000
and it makes you sexually aroused.
If it puts you into a state of defensive

12
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:38,001
aggression and it,
it actually also makes you explore and 

13
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:39,210
be curious.
All of that,

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,430
hypothalamic.
It's an amazing structure.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,580
And then,
and,

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,600
and it's really small and it's right at 
the base of the brain.

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,850
Um,
and you could imagine it as something 

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,451
that has tremendously powerful 
projections upward throughout the rest 

19
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:57,291
of the brain into the emotional systems 
and the cortical systems and all of 

20
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,650
that,
like tree trunk size connections,

21
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:00,330
you know,
metaphorically speaking.

22
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,850
And then the cortex has these little 
like vine,

23
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:06,330
like tendrils going down to regulate the
hypothalamus,

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,110
you know,
and if it's,

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
when push comes to shove,
man,

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,380
the hypothalamus that thing wins.
And so,

27
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:18,381
you know,
you get people now and then who have a 

28
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:19,440
hypothalamic dysfunction and one of them
produces a condition called,

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,910
I can't remember it.
It's not dip.

30
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:23,740
So mania,
although it's,

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,170
it's like that doesn't matter.
It produces an uncontrollable thirst.

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,560
And so what will happen is that people 
who have this hypothalamic problem will 

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,060
drown themselves by drinking water,
which,

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,940
which you can do by the way.
Uh,

35
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,300
and so they just cannot get enough water
and there's no stopping them,

36
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,440
right?
No,

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,590
no more than there would be stopping you
if you were suffering from raging 

38
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,011
thirst.
It's like it's a happy day when the 

39
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:52,011
hypothalamus is not telling you what to 
do.

40
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,020
And you know,
you live in such a civilized state that 

41
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,800
most of the time,
roughly speaking,

42
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:03,801
you're tranquil and satisfied and more 
or less you can imagine yourself as a 

43
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:05,660
peaceful,
you know,

44
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,870
productive well meaning entity.
But don't be thinking that that's what 

45
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:17,871
you'd be if you were putting the right 
situation because that's just not right 

46
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
at all.
So,

47
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,270
you know,
lots of times soldiers developed post 

48
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,270
traumatic stress disorder because they 
go out of the battlefield,

49
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,870
they're kind of naive.
They're young guys,

50
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:25,290
you know,
and,

51
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,370
and,
and,

52
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:29,430
uh,
it actually is worse if they're not that

53
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:34,431
bright.
It turns out because having a lower Iq 

54
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:34,740
is one of the things that predisposes 
you to post traumatic stress disorder.

55
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:39,741
But anyways,
they go out in the battlefield and they 

56
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:39,840
see what they're capable of under 
battlefield conditions.

57
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:40,950
And like,
you know,

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
we,
we had been fighting wars for a very 

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
long time,
millions of years.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,690
You know,
chimps basically have wars with other 

61
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:50,690
chimps,
the troops,

62
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,890
right?
Because the juveniles will patrol the 

63
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,550
perimeter perimeter of their territory 
and if they find other chimps from other

64
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:01,551
troops that they outnumber,
they will tear them to pieces like in 

65
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:02,530
chimps are really,
really strong.

66
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:04,750
And so when I say they'll tear them to 
pieces,

67
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,130
I mean that literally,
you know,

68
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,140
they,
they tear them to pieces.

69
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,470
And Jane Goodall discovered that 
originally in 19 seventies and she 

70
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,460
didn't even report it for awhile because
she was so shocked,

71
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,730
you know,
she kind of assumed like most followers 

72
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,341
of Ruth's soul,
that the human proclivity for warfare 

73
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:23,830
was part.
That part.

74
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,780
That was something that was a uniquely 
human,

75
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:27,270
you know,
it had something to do with our,

76
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,360
our unique self consciousness or 
intelligence or something like that.

77
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,470
She had no idea that it was rooted that 
deeply,

78
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:35,870
you know,
we,

79
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,920
we split from chimps about six,
7 million years ago,

80
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:39,760
something like that.

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,760
And so we were patrolling and territory.
We were gang members 7 million years 

82
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:47,740
ago.
And you know,

83
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,300
at that that's,
that's minimum estimation because of 

84
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,371
course that ancestor shaded back maybe 
$20 million years into entities that 

85
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:04,540
were roughly primate like and so 
territoriality and the.

86
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,080
And the proclivity to defend territory 
is so deeply embedded in us.

87
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,340
It's,
it's,

88
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,280
it's like,
it's,

89
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,770
it's like it's the,
the control center for our whole brain.

90
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,590
And so there isn't anything more 
important to us,

91
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:22,591
I would say.
Then maintaining the match between what 

92
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:29,071
we want to have happen and what other 
people are doing in response to our 

93
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:31,030
actions.
Like that's that that's what we want and

94
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,330
as long as that matches maintained,
then our emotional systems and I would 

95
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,580
say anxiety is probably primary in that 
regard.

96
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,790
Our emotional systems remain inhibited.
They're on,

97
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,060
they're ready like,
like a nuclear reactor.

98
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,810
Rods are on and the rest of the brain 
dampens them down.

99
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:56,170
But it's like if you don't want them to 
take time to start up,

100
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,360
man,
you want them to be on at a,

101
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,300
at a 10th of a second's notice when it's
necessary.

102
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,860
And so you know,
that's kind of why.

103
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,840
Well,
if you look at a wild animal,

104
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,690
it's like it's alert,
you know,

105
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,590
it's ready to dark this way or that way,
especially a prey animal instantaneously

106
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:16,591
and it has reflex is built into it as 
you do that will respond way before your

107
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,120
conscious.
So for example,

108
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,690
if you happen to be walking down a trail
and you detect something snake like in 

109
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,011
the periphery,
you'll leap away before you even know 

110
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:33,150
that you lapped.
And that's because it takes a fair bit 

111
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,331
of time to actually see a snake,
by which I mean form a conscious 

112
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:37,970
representation of the snake,
you know,

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,540
maybe it takes a quarter of a second or 
something like that,

114
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,330
or even longer,
but doesn't matter.

115
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,830
Maybe it takes 10.
No 20th of a set a 10th of a second.

116
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:50,740
But the thing about the damn snake is 
it's way faster than that.

117
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,480
It's really fast.
That thing,

118
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,760
and it coevolved with primates by the 
way.

119
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,000
And so it can nail you like way faster 
than you can look at it.

120
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:03,230
So you have your eyes map,
snake like objects,

121
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,560
right onto your reflexes so that the 
eyes go,

122
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,820
the eyes make you jump,
and then they see after that's like,

123
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:13,040
yeah,
well now you can see that's no problem,

124
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,390
you know,
so.

125
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,130
All right,
all.

126
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,730
Alright now what I would say that what 
we do is we live in a shared story and 

127
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,080
the story is a way of looking at the 
world and its way of acting in the world

128
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:32,081
at the same time.
And that story has to operate within 

129
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:35,350
narrow parameters.
And this is something that's 

130
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,601
extraordinarily important to understand 
because this is something I think that 

131
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:41,981
piaget figured out,
John Piaget figured out better than 

132
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:41,981
anyone else.

133
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:42,410
I think he really got this right.
And by the way,

134
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,540
one of the things that piaget was trying
to do,

135
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,750
you never hear about how strange these 
great thinkers are.

136
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:50,480
But Piaget was a very strange guy and he
was a.

137
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,660
He was a hyper genius.
He was offered the curatorship of a 

138
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,840
bloody museum when he was 10 years old,
you know,

139
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,940
because he wrote this little paper on 
mollusks,

140
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:03,941
which parent was very good.
And so they offered him the curatorship 

141
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:04,610
of a museum and his parents wrote back 
and said,

142
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:05,270
well,
you know,

143
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,140
no,
probably not because he said he's 

144
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,140
actually tad.
And so that was piaget man,

145
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,040
the guy who was a genius and you know,
he,

146
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:17,660
he was actually motivated by the desire 
to reconcile science and religion.

147
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,720
That was,
that was actually his entire motivation 

148
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:22,910
for what he did.
You'd never hear that.

149
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,320
But that's,
that's the case.

150
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,010
And so piaget was very interested in how
you produce structures that enable you 

151
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,290
to regulate yourself.
Because you're like a kind of a,

152
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,580
a colony of strange sub animals that 
have to figure out how to get along so 

153
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,881
that you can sort of be one thing.
You kind of learned that I would say 

154
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,630
between the ages of two and four as 
you're being socialized,

155
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,550
you know,
how erratic two year olds are.

156
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:51,551
I mean,
they're a blast and it's partly because 

157
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:51,551
they were erratic.
It's like they're unbelievably happy and

158
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,800
then they're unbelievably hungry and 
then they're really hot and then they're

159
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,690
really upset and crying,
you know?

160
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:58,700
And then they're really scared.
It's like an,

161
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:02,420
all of that is just untrammeled and so 
it's really fun to be around them,

162
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:05,090
especially when they're happy because 
they're so happy that it's just,

163
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,530
you know,
you don't ever get to be that happy and 

164
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,511
so it's nice to be around the two year 
old because you can kinda feel that 

165
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,270
again,
you know,

166
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:15,230
and a lot of what the.

167
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:20,230
One of the horrible things about being a
parent is that you spend a tremendous 

168
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,400
amount of your time making your child 
less happy.

169
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,900
And the reason for that is that positive
emotion is a very impulsive,

170
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,880
you know,
and you know because everybody says,

171
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:29,900
well,
you should be happy.

172
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,370
It's like,
well no,

173
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,830
when you're happy you're actually quite 
stupid.

174
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,650
And so because happiness makes you 
impulsive,

175
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:38,750
happiness makes happiness,
says hey,

176
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:43,751
things are really good right now.
Get what you can while the getting's 

177
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:44,690
good.
And so as a like,

178
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,691
if you're hyper optimistic,
manic will say it's like every stock 

179
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,410
investment looks like a really good 
stock investment.

180
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:54,080
It's like you won't spend all your money
because look at,

181
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:59,081
there's those wonderful things 
everywhere and you could do such great 

182
00:08:59,081 --> 00:08:59,081
things with them.
And then you know,

183
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,340
you spend all your money and then you 
crash and you think,

184
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,840
Oh God,
my life's over,

185
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:04,770
you know,
because I just,

186
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,310
I just spent all my money on all this 
useless stuff.

187
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,920
And it's all under the grip of 
impulsive,

188
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,780
positive emotion,
you know?

189
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:17,781
And so when,
when you're telling your kids to be 

190
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:19,860
quiet and settled down,
it isn't because they're making a lot of

191
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:22,560
noise.
Being in pain is because they're running

192
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:27,510
around like wild baboons having a blast 
and disrupting things like mad,

193
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,100
you know,
you got kids,

194
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,420
you got to settle down,
you know,

195
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:35,421
like quit having so much fun and it's,
it's kind of awful that you do that,

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,070
but,
but you do.

197
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,670
And that's because the emotions and the 
motivations have to be brought into like

198
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,830
a relationship with one another within 
the person.

199
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,510
So that,
you know,

200
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,730
one thing I remember with my son who is 
quite,

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,720
he's quite disagreeable by temperament,
which is actually a good thing as far as

202
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:57,300
I'm concerned,
although it brings its own challenges.

203
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,600
And so with my daughter when she was 
misbehaving,

204
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,870
she was pretty agreeable and uh,
you know,

205
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:09,840
if she was misbehaving I can basically 
just look at her and then she'd quit,

206
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,040
you know,
but my son,

207
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,430
it was like,
that was just nothing.

208
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,490
You're looking at me.
It's like,

209
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:16,140
no,
that's just not going to go anywhere,

210
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:16,470
man.
