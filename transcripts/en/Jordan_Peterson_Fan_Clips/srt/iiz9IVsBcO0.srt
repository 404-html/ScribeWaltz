1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,880
Okay,
so that's a big mistake that the 

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:06,880
postmodernist made.
That's not trivial.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,210
That's a big mistake,
but it's not the only one.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
Well,
here's another one.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,140
They don't like inequality.
Well,

6
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:17,141
who does?
I'm against poverty.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,270
You know,
that's like classic protest sign.

8
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:21,260
It's like,
really?

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,470
It's like I'm against torture.
It's like it's so obvious.

10
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:30,560
You don't get any Brownie points for 
being against poverty.

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,320
No one in their right mind is for 
poverty.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,160
You know,
you ever watched the simpsons?

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,210
You ever see the Republican Party in the
simpsons,

14
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:45,260
they all meet in an old haunted castle 
at night with like lightning bolts going

15
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:50,261
off and there's a vampire and a crazy 
texts and then even the Simpson 

16
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:53,240
Republicans don't sit around in the 
haunted tower at midnight saying,

17
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,070
Hey,
we need more poverty.

18
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:08,050
Here's an interesting thing.
So one of the postmodernists claims is 

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,880
that diversity is necessary and they 
make it racial and they make it sexual.

20
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:15,140
They may get ethnic and all of that.
That's actually technically incorrect by

21
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:19,750
the way,
because I study individual differences.

22
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,790
So those are the differences between 
people.

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,920
I know the literature.
So you know about James Damore memo 

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,621
right from Google.
He wrote that partly because he was 

25
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,811
watching my videos,
which is why he wanted me to interview 

26
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,331
him and I'm a believer that there are 
biological differences in temperament 

27
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:41,281
between men and women apart from the 
other obvious differences and that 

28
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:41,281
they're actually not trivial

29
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,190
and that they maximizing the societies 
that have the most have moved farthest 

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,220
to producing egalitarian states,
the Scandinavian countries,

31
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,340
and that.
The reason for that is that there's two 

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,340
reasons why men and women,
different temperament.

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,730
One is biological and the other is 
environmental,

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,520
and if you remove the environmental 
variation,

35
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,560
which you do,
if you make the state egalitarian,

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,800
you maximize the genetic variation and 
that's been demonstrated in the 

37
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,160
scientific literature over about four 
decades and no one wanted it or hope for

38
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:17,161
it and they weren't biased and looking 
for it because that was exactly the 

39
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:17,740
opposite of what social scientists 
wanted to find.

40
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,400
Because social scientists lean heavily 
to the left and what they wanted to find

41
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:26,401
was you flatten out the state so that 
everyone has equal opportunity and the 

42
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:28,690
differences between people disappear.
That is not what happened.

43
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,930
The opposite happened that wasn't wrong 
and no one was happy about it and no 

44
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:39,331
one's happy about it.
Now you can actually tell when you've 

45
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:42,271
discovered something in the social 
science because you're not happy about 

46
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:45,811
it,
but

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,380
if you take,
let's say there's a big difference 

48
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,380
between men and women in terms of trait,
agreeableness,

49
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,380
compassion and politeness on average,
women are more than men and the 

50
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,061
difference is approximately this.
If you take random pairs of men and 

51
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,421
women out of the population,
let's say you had to make a back on who 

52
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:09,880
was more agreeable.
If you bet that it was the woman,

53
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,880
you'd be right 60 percent of the time.
Well,

54
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,400
that's not that much.
It means you'd be wrong.

55
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,610
Forty percent of the time.
That's almost 50 percent of the time.

56
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,880
So this is a big difference by social 
science standards,

57
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,700
but that's the magnitude of the 
difference.

58
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,320
There are some differences that are 
bigger,

59
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,740
like the difference between men and 
women's interest in people versus things

60
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,230
is actually bigger than that.
That's the biggest difference we know,

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,320
but it's a big difference.
Let's say the agreeable this difference,

62
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:40,321
but still they the shared attributes of 
men and women far outweigh the 

63
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,210
attributes that differentiate them 
because you could ask are there more 

64
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,960
differences with any groups or between 
them?

65
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,590
Now the postmodern answer to that is 
between them.

66
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,490
That's why you need diversity by group,
right?

67
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,550
That's why you need different races.
That's why you need different 

68
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,550
ethnicities and sexual preferences and 
all of that.

69
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,510
Well,
that's wrong.

70
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,350
There's moral difference within the 
groups than there is between them.

71
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:11,590
You don't get diversity by crossing the 
groups.

72
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,040
You get diversity by,
by selecting across individuals.

73
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,310
In fact,
the idea that there is more differences 

74
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,951
between groups said there is between 
individuals is actually the fundamental 

75
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:25,180
racist idea.
It's the fundamental racist idea,

76
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:25,960
which is,
well,

77
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:30,961
let's say you're Asian Oriental to use 
the old word to discriminate the one 

78
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:37,860
type of Asian say from the other.
You're so different from me that there's

79
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,870
no overlap between our groups and you're
also so different and there's so little 

80
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,750
difference within your group that now 
that I know that you're not me,

81
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,090
you're not one of mine.
I actually know what you're like,

82
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,380
no,
technically that's incorrect.

83
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,020
That's wrong.
That isn't how you get diversity.

84
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,550
Now,
diversity is actually necessary because 

85
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,621
people differ in intelligence and a 
different temperament and the different 

86
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:10,531
skills and so you actually need 
diversity because otherwise you can't 

87
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:10,540
take advantage of all those differences,

88
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,380
so you need diversity,
but you need genuine diversity and like 

89
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,480
what would genuine diversity mean?
If you're trying to put together a work 

90
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:22,480
team,
you want enough,

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,800
you want people have sufficient 
diversity so that they more or less so 

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,151
that you gathered together the 
appropriate talent to produce the 

93
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:33,500
implement that's necessary to work 
properly in the world.

94
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,640
That's a competence marker because 
otherwise your business is going to fail

95
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,910
and so the proper diversity with regards
to employment is the diversity that 

96
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,910
meets the requirements of the business 
essentially.

97
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Obviously that's why you try to hire 
people carefully and not randomly.

98
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:58,481
Let's say third year our first errors.
There's only a finite number of valid 

99
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:07,801
interpretation.
Second error is that there are real 

100
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:12,001
differences between groups of people,
but there's more differences within the 

101
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:12,001
groups.
Then between them.

102
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:15,820
Third Difference is social status and 
payment,

103
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,970
especially in a free democratic 
capitalist society is based more on 

104
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,130
competence than on

105
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,430
power.

106
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,730
In fact,
we would say that when a person in a 

107
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,840
hierarchy starts to act like their 
position,

108
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,940
entitles them to power,
then that hierarchy has become corrupt.

109
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,310
Harvey Weinstein is a good example of 
that.

110
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,780
I'm serious.
It's like he aksed acted like a tyrant.

111
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,480
What happened to him?
It's not good,

112
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,170
not good for him.
What he did was not good,

113
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,930
but it's an indication.
It's revealed.

114
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:56,550
It's an indication that that misuse,
so he's competent,

115
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,480
fine.
He gets to have position because we need

116
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,510
people who are competent,
but that doesn't mean you get to turn 

117
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,510
into a tyrant.
If you turn it into a tyrant,

118
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,120
then that overshadows your competence 
and you go.

119
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,420
That's the definition of a functioning 
state and our state essentially 

120
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,330
functioned.
It's not perfect,

121
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,500
that's for sure,

122
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,480
but compared to what?

123
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,430
That's the issue compared to your 
hypothetical Marxist Utopia,

124
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,730
while compared to your hypothetical 
Marxist Utopia.

125
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,070
I mean,
we're living in Auschwitz,

126
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,280
but your but your actual Marxist utopia 
is indistinguishable from Auschwitz,

127
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,910
so we're not listening to that 
comparison.

128
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,180
We're going to take a look at what we 
have and we're going to compare it to 

129
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,210
other places that actually existed in 
time and geographically and by those 

130
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:48,870
criteria.
It's like,

131
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,940
is there another time you'd rather live 
is another place you'd rather live,

132
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:57,360
I mean a real place and in real time,
have you want to live back in 18,

133
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:02,361
95.
Even in the western world where the 

134
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:02,361
average person lived on less than a 
dollar a day.

135
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:06,571
In today's money,
you want to live like those coal miners 

136
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,510
like the answer to that is no.
If you have any sense,

137
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:14,511
you should have some gratitude.
That's another problem with the 

138
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:15,960
postmodern neo Marxists like zero,
zero,

139
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,900
zero gratitude.
It's all,

140
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,910
oh my God,
I'm more pressed.

141
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,740
Of course you're oppressed,
but you're not impressed by the 

142
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:27,740
Patriarchy for God's sake.

143
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,560
So you have status in the hierarchy.
You might say,

144
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:38,561
well,
that's like a reward to your a high 

145
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:38,561
status person.
It's a reward.

146
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:41,840
That reward should be shared equally.
It's like a badge of merit that you get.

147
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,160
It's a privilege.
It's not the reason that in a capitalist

148
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:51,161
society,
filthy selfish capitalists put you in 

149
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:54,861
the position so they can extract maximum
productivity from you and that's exactly

150
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,790
why you're there.
You get paid,

151
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,380
you get paid,
so you keep working.

152
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:03,381
Why do we want you to work?
Because your work is actually valuable 

153
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:04,950
to us and so we're going to pay you so 
you don't quit.

154
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,350
It's not a reward because you're a good 
guy.

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,260
It's not a privilege.
That's not what it is.

156
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,690
You don't hand those things out like 
merit badges.

157
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,930
That's not how it works.
The society is setup on selfish 

158
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,021
principles.
We pay people who are competent so they 

159
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:21,960
won't stop striving because we want what
they can produce.

160
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,860
So you don't just distribute that like 
like it's a gift.

161
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,320
It's not a gift.
It's not a gift at all.

162
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,150
So that's another place where they're 
wrong.

163
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,020
Social Status and payment is the 
consequence of the selfish desire of 

164
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,150
individuals and the group to extract 
resources of intellect,

165
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:44,151
creativity,
and industriousness from those who 

166
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,270
possess them in excess.
Now,

167
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:47,400
of course,
it's not 100 percent like that.

168
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,710
There's the incompetent people who rise 
to the top.

169
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,740
You can fool people and you can 
manipulate them and you can act like a 

170
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,670
tyrant and you know,
we might say maybe the system is like 30

171
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:59,040
percent warped,
something like that.

172
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,100
It's not much more than that because we 
can account for people's success across 

173
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,610
life by looking at their individual 
differences,

174
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:07,800
intelligence comp,
conscientiousness,

175
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,140
emotional stability,
creativity.

176
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,200
We can do a pretty good job of 
predicting their trajectory.

177
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,260
So there's error,
some of its health,

178
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:21,261
right?
Because sometimes you've got what you 

179
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:21,261
need,
but you get cut off at the knees or your

180
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:23,300
family members do or you know,
some tragic thing befalls you.

181
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:29,030
There's a randomness in the system that 
accounts for a fair bit of it and then 

182
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,750
there's a certain amount of corruption.
Fair enough,

183
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,830
but not so much that the lights go off.
