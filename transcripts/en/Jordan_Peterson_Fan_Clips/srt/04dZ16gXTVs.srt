1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:04,960
So I'm going to start talking to you 
about Pinocchio a little bit.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,830
Weirdly enough,
I hope you enjoy this,

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,770
and the reason I want to do it is 
because I want to.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,830
I want to put some.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,470
I want to bring what I told you 
abstractly down to earth and then you 

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,440
can start thinking,
well,

7
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,450
do the conceptions that I've introduced 
to you,

8
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:27,160
are they,
are they good for anything?

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,720
Did they help?
That's the order.

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,300
Descend into chaos,
reestablishment of order.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,330
That's paradise lost.
Profane history,

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,450
paradise regained.
It's the classic comedy and that's the 

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,970
story of life.
And so the question is how do you manage

14
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:53,100
it?
And so that's a question you really want

15
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,180
to know the answer to.
So you'll go,

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,300
you'll pay money weirdly,
you'll line up and pay money to see a 

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,891
story about that even if you don't even 
know that that's what the story is 

18
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:05,860
about.
And the reason for that is that actually

19
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:07,660
part of you doesn't know what the 
story's about.

20
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,870
You know you have your cognition has 
multiple layers.

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,170
You understand things that you don't 
know you understand in ways that you 

22
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:20,390
don't understand and you can tell that 
because you know,

23
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:22,190
we,
we talked about Pinocchio a little bit,

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,520
how absurd it is and that it doesn't 
matter.

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,260
Well,

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,240
so we've been talking.
People don't do what they expect you to 

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,600
do it in the negative sense.
What if the reaction is extremely 

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,030
positive,
like something that click like winning a

29
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:43,320
lottery.
Does that,

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,540
do you also go into the stress response 
so you the same thing?

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,350
Not Quite the same thing.
It's a good question and we will address

32
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,180
that.
We will address that.

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,960
I mean winning the lottery is generally 
not a good idea for people,

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,930
you know,
because it's just too much.

35
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,580
It's too much for them.
Flips their lives upside down so.

36
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,140
And they tend to at best to return to 
their original baseline level of 

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,260
emotion.
But yeah,

38
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:16,261
something remarkably good.
I mean it's a lot better than something 

39
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:20,880
remarkably bad obviously,
but it still can have that destabilizing

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,150
effect.
So it depends on what elements of your 

41
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,720
life it disrupts it.
Like it's some,

42
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,820
some in some sense you have a map that 
you're operating within in the world and

43
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:36,990
that map is predicated on assumptions of
different sorts,

44
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,230
some shallow,
some profound when the profound 

45
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,150
assumptions are devastated,
huge chunks of the map or invalidated.

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,360
And that can happen sometimes when 
dramatically positive things happen as 

47
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,510
well.
So,

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,840
but the fundamental rule is the more of 
your axiomatic presuppositions

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,310
are disrupted,
the harder it is on you.

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,410
You know,
like maybe you quit your job because you

51
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:05,520
win the lottery.
It's like,

52
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,540
Hey,
I'm off to the beach,

53
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:10,290
I'm going to drink Margaritas.
So that'll work for about four days.

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,940
You know,
you do that for three months,

55
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,920
you're a,
you're a beach alcoholic.

56
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:16,110
It's like that's a real improvement,
you know,

57
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:18,330
so it's not that easy.
And often too,

58
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,740
if you take people out of their routine,
you know,

59
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,860
they just flounder.
Their circadian rhythms go.

60
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:28,440
They don't eat properly,
they don't know what the hell to do,

61
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,940
you know.
So this is often why people have such a 

62
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,240
hard time when they retire.
I'm going to retire and relax.

63
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,300
It's like fire relaxed for two weeks.
I would die,

64
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,810
you know,
I need something to do.

65
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,660
I need to be engaged in something.
So,

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,660
okay.
Pinocchio,

67
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,410
Disney movie and early one a 
masterpiece.

68
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,740
And so I'm going to walk you through it 
and I'm going to tell you what I think 

69
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,050
it means and you can tell me if you 
think that that's useful.

70
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:08,051
And I'm only going to do that for about 
10 minutes today because I do want to 

71
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,111
cover some of the details of the class.
And then next class we'll continue with 

72
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:11,960
this.
So,

73
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,400
so the movie opens with the opening 
credits which are carved wooden signs,

74
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,050
which is like a hint,
you know,

75
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:27,051
because Japan was a carver and it starts
with this song which was actually quite 

76
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:31,590
a popular song and it's a bit of a,
what would you call it?

77
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,570
I don't think it's,
the poetry is particularly profound,

78
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,410
but it was a song that people liked and 
people still listened to.

79
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:43,980
And um,
it sets the tone for the movie,

80
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,070
which is what music does.
One of the things that's really 

81
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,410
interesting about movies,
it's really mysterious is that,

82
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,320
you know,
if you go to a movie,

83
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:55,020
there's almost always a soundtrack,
right?

84
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:57,090
If you go to a movie and the reason to 
soundtrack it,

85
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,230
it kind of feels empty.
It feels like there's something missing 

86
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,230
and you know,
it's as if the music,

87
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,940
you know,
when you go to a movie,

88
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:04,830
there's lots of things you can't see.

89
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,830
The characters are only partial and you 
don't know anything about their 

90
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,310
background.
So it's like a low resolution thing.

91
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,530
What seems to happen with the music is 
that it provides the emotional 

92
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,770
background,
the complex context,

93
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:20,610
let's say it's like a substitute for the
context and it,

94
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,090
it guides you in your,
in your perceptions of the movie.

95
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,190
It gives you hints about what's going to
happen.

96
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:27,200
And,
and,

97
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,520
and the funny thing about that is,
is that we just,

98
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,140
we just don't have any problem with 
that.

99
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,400
You know,
it's like,

100
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,770
yeah,
of course movie has its own track and,

101
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,930
and of course when there's a dramatic 
scene and the music gets dramatic and,

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,120
but that doesn't happen in real life.
So you'd wonder why we would accept it 

103
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,810
in a movie and I think it's partly 
because we're willing to accept the 

104
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,860
amplification of reality that 
constitutes a movie and in fact we find 

105
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:57,171
that compelling and music is one of the 
things that does that amplification the 

106
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:57,770
dramatization,
and that's,

107
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,000
that's acceptable to us.
This song I find quite interesting.

108
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,800
So I'm going to take it apart quite a 
bit.

109
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:04,920
Um,

110
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,800
in some sense I feel foolish doing it 
because it's,

111
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:11,690
you know,
it's a,

112
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,780
it's a childish,
it's a childish song in some ways,

113
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,080
but,
but that's okay.

114
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,920
When you wish upon a star,
makes no difference who you are.

115
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,110
Well,
okay,

116
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,350
there's some mysteries there people wish
upon stars.

117
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:32,820
That's like a little ritual,
right?

118
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,500
Why do they do that?

119
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,670
Well,

120
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,570
and what exactly is the star?
That's another question because there 

121
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,870
are stars that shine in the heavens and 
there are people who are stars.

122
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,110
And so

123
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,730
why are people stars while they're 
usually famous people,

124
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:05,731
right?
There are people that who attract a lot 

125
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:06,310
of attention and maybe there are people 
who have a lot of talent.

126
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:08,340
That's another possibility.
Um,

127
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,890
maybe their models.
I don't mean you know,

128
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,760
clothing models,
although sometimes they are,

129
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:16,450
but there are models for emulation.
That's what being a star means.

130
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:18,820
That's why people magazine is full of 
stars.

131
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,350
It's like they're,
they're like,

132
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,640
they're like heroes brought to earth and
of course you know nothing about them.

133
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:29,641
All,
you know is their public persona and of 

134
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:32,641
course they're usually very attractive 
and so that allows you to project upon 

135
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:37,291
them all of the things that would go 
along with ideal humanity and so their 

136
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:42,331
stars and,
but still why stars stars beckon in the 

137
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:43,420
darkness,
right?

138
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,050
And their other worldly.
That's the thing.

139
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:52,051
That's cool.
They're not of this earth and I mean 

140
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,520
that technically because obviously 
they're not of this earth,

141
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:55,360
but I also mean it.

142
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,370
I mean it phenomenologically I mean it 
as an element of human experience.

143
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:05,371
So most of you are urban and so you've 
not had the experience of perhaps of the

144
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,850
full night sky,
you know,

145
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:14,851
and that's really too bad because the 
full night's sky is one of those 

146
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:17,620
experiences that actually induces all 
naturally,

147
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,680
you know,
and no wonder you look up there and 

148
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:22,680
there's just stars everywhere,
right?

149
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,520
You're looking at the edge of the 
galaxy.

150
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:26,290
That's actually,
that's the Milky Way,

151
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,640
right?
It's the edge of the galaxy.

152
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,290
It's like,
wow,

153
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,440
there's the edge of the galaxy and 
there's just so many of them and it's 

154
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,160
such an expansive.
You're looking into infinity,

155
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,910
you're looking into the unknown,
you're looking beyond yourself,

156
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,130
that's for sure.
And you know,

157
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:47,131
that produces a sense of awe in people 
like looking at the Grand Canyon or 

158
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:50,551
something like that.
And you're looking at something that 

159
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:50,551
transcends yourself.

160
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:52,170
But that feeling of awe,
that seems to be something that's,

161
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,030
that's,
that's a natural part.

162
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,150
Our response,
you know,

163
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,930
you might feel,
or when you meet someone that you regard

164
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:04,931
as particularly admirable as well 
because you'll feel that there's 

165
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:08,091
something transcendent about them.
So here's an interesting thing to think 

166
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:11,481
about.
There are people you admire and there 

167
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:14,700
are people that you don't admire and 
that's a clue,

168
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:19,701
right?
That's a clue as to your value system 

169
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:20,000
and it might be not really something you
can even put your finger on.

170
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,020
It's like if you find this person 
captivating,

171
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:24,770
you find this person and admirable and 
it's,

172
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:28,410
it's as if there's something inside of 
you that's looking for what's admirable,

173
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,610
you know,
assuming that you are and that person 

174
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:33,610
who's admirable has a,
has a faculty,

175
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,570
some faculty that you would like to have
for yourself.

176
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,650
And so there are a model for emulation 
and that's part of how people develop.

177
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,680
You know,
like little kids often develop little 

178
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,250
hero crushes on older kids,
you know,

179
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,530
not that much older,
but sort of the person that sort of just

180
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:54,531
within their grasp and then they follow 
them around and imitate them and you 

181
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:57,981
know,
so they're imitating what they find 

182
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:57,981
admirable.
Well,

183
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,760
the fact that you find something 
admirable as a hint,

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,940
as to the structure of your unconscious 
value system.

185
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,900
And so you could think even as an 
exercise,

186
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:11,010
you can take well what qualities of a 
human being do I find admirable?

187
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,110
You have to ask yourself that in a 
sense.

188
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,250
You can't really think about it.
There is a difference between asking 

189
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,720
yourself a question and thinking about 
it,

190
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,440
you know,
because it's more like when you're 

191
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:24,440
asking yourself a question,
it's contemplating,

192
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:24,960
it's like,
well,

193
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,500
what do I find admirable?
It's question you don't know.

194
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:31,320
And if you're fortunate and this happens
quite regularly,

195
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,950
an answer will float up from wherever 
the hell answers float up.

196
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:36,000
And you know,
Oh yeah,

197
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:41,001
that's one.
And you can write that down and you get 

198
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:41,520
some idea of what your ideal is,
you know,

199
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:44,910
and you have one likely.
And what your counter ideal is.
