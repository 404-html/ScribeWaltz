1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,660
The question is what is the stable way 
of solving how to live together across 

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,281
time and that really is the question and
it's part of the question that I'm 

3
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:13,971
trying to answer,
partly because it's a perennial problem,

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,580
right?
We,

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,700
we faced the problem of how to organize 
ourselves in small social units without 

6
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:24,891
undue conflict and then we face the 
larger problem of how to organize 

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,230
ourselves into large social units 
without undue conflict and that conflict

8
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,500
can be absolutely devastating and,
and,

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,580
and frequently is so.
So then I would also say that the first 

10
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:40,200
way of solving this problem isn't 
conscious.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,140
You see not at all.
And you know,

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,380
you may know and you may not know that 
there are,

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,860
there are different forms of memory,
right?

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,170
Really technically different forms of 
memory.

15
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:55,830
So for example,
there's short term working memory,

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,400
which is the memory that you use to hold
things like telephone numbers in your 

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,180
active imagination.
It decays very rapidly.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,040
It's only about four to seven bits,
which is why well,

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,850
it's white phone numbers or were at 
least seven digits long.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,930
You know,
you can kind of manage that as a loop.

21
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,130
That and then there's episodic memory 
and that has two elements.

22
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:27,570
One is semantic and the other is a 
episodic.

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,760
It's a.
what's the name of that?

24
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,440
Someone's.
Someone said something.

25
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,270
Yes.
Well there's procedural memory and then 

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,131
there's,
there's another kind of memory that you 

27
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:44,790
use to represent your experiences to 
yourself.

28
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:49,791
So let's say it's image Laden and the 
other one is semantic and semantic is 

29
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,350
your memory for facts and those are 
quite different.

30
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:55,080
So for example,
procedural memory,

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,590
that's how you ride a bike.
That's how you play the piano.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,290
That's how you play jazz music.
If you're in a combo,

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,510
it's,
it's the memory,

34
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,400
it's,
it's,

35
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,410
it's a funny kind of memory because it's
actually built right into you.

36
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,440
You know,
I mean so is so is the kind of memory 

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,011
that used to represent your own life,
but it's much more malleable in some 

38
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,191
sense.
So what that means is that in your 

39
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:23,241
procedures there is information that you
don't know about pattern information 

40
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:27,240
that you don't know about.
Part of that is how to act,

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,600
you know,
like when you walk into a social 

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,791
gathering,
you don't really think through how 

43
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:34,791
you're going to act.

44
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:38,150
You know,
how to act and if someone asked you 

45
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,210
exactly what it is that you're doing and
why you could formulate a story about 

46
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,750
it,
but the probability that,

47
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,370
that it's the existence of that story 
that enabled you to act that way is zero

48
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:50,130
because you have to react way faster 
than that.

49
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,220
And so you know,
you have social knowledge built into 

50
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,791
your nervous system because you've 
practiced being a social being for a 

51
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,960
very long period of time.
And of course then that social being has

52
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:05,860
been shaped for forever really.
And it's the right way of thinking about

53
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:06,540
it.
You know,

54
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,610
we know that animals organize themselves
into hierarchies and we'll say of 

55
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:15,070
dominance because it's more true the 
farther back you go in time,

56
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,770
at least since the time of the 
crustaceans.

57
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,820
You know,
when we split from our common ancestor 

58
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:22,820
300 million years ago.

59
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,570
And so it's true for social animals and 
non social animals.

60
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:30,571
So even animals that don't live together
in groups have to organize themselves 

61
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:35,731
into a hierarchy in this space.
They inhabit songbirds are a good 

62
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:37,090
example and they have dominance disputes
all the time.

63
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,390
Partly that's you can hear them having 
their little dominance disputes in the 

64
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,500
spring when they're singing because 
basically what they're saying is I'm 

65
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,190
pretty damn healthy and now I'm ready to
go and if you're another bird like me,

66
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:50,800
you better steer clear of this tree.
And,

67
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,920
and the,
the dominant song birds,

68
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,750
you know,
they don't live together.

69
00:03:55,751 --> 00:04:00,751
Crows social,
but most songbirds aren't the dominant 

70
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:03,831
song.
Birds get the best nest and the best 

71
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:05,660
nest is the one that doesn't get rained 
on and isn't,

72
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,570
it's not too windy and it's close to 
food sources and you know,

73
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:14,571
and so then they have the healthiest 
chicks and they attract the best mates 

74
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:16,450
and like it's really important where 
you're positioned in the hierarchy,

75
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:19,810
even if you're not like a flock or herd 
creature.

76
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,080
Now we're more like herd creatures.
So it's even more even,

77
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,470
it's even more irrelevant to us,
but there's just no escaping a 

78
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:28,830
hierarchical arrangement in,
in,

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,400
in social being that is social being 
and,

80
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,430
and,
and it's evolutionarily ancient beyond 

81
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,241
conception.
So 300 million years ago there weren't 

82
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:42,241
trees,
you know,

83
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,110
I mean,
so the dominance hierarchy is older than

84
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:49,111
trees.
So that's really something to think 

85
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:49,111
about.
And then you know,

86
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:50,560
when you're thinking about the reality 
that shaped us,

87
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,850
say from an evolutionary perspective,
but also from a cultural perspective,

88
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,050
what you have to understand is that the 
things that have shaped us most are the 

89
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,170
things that have been around the 
longest.

90
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:07,171
And so you could say those are the most 
real things and you can't even see some 

91
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:07,540
of them.
Like,

92
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,540
it's not like you can come in here.
Well it's not exactly true.

93
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,690
You can't come in here and see the 
multiple dominance hierarchies that are 

94
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:15,690
at work.

95
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,650
You can't in a way because the chairs 
are set up to face this way and I'm 

96
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,360
facing that way.
That gives you some clues about the 

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,180
social order here and you take the cues 
instantly,

98
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,410
right?
You come down,

99
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,620
you sit in the chairs,
you organize yourselves according to 

100
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,890
mutual expectation,
and that's part of your procedural 

101
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,980
knowledge about how to behave as a 
social creature.

102
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,430
Now that knowledge is really,
really deep and a lot of it's coded in 

103
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,250
your behavior now and another people's 
behavior as well and that's you know,

104
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:50,251
that's,
that's the expectations you have of 

105
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,641
other people,
end of yourself and a lot of those are 

106
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:52,641
implicit,
right?

107
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:53,170
So when we're interacting,
there's,

108
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,200
there's a,
there's a very large number of things 

109
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
that you just don't get to and you know 
that too and you won't do them.

110
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:05,230
And that way we can act as if we 
understand each other even though we 

111
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,731
don't because you're really complicated 
and I'm really complicated and there's 

112
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:11,780
lots of situations where we might really
be in conflict,

113
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,710
but because we share a map of the 
culture,

114
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,320
the cultural expectations,
it makes part of our.

115
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,350
It's built right into our perception.
You will act out that set of 

116
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,320
expectations and so will I,
and if neither of us can do that,

117
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,360
even if one of us can't,
we're going to stay.

118
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,420
We're either going to immediately 
devolve into conflict or we're going to 

119
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,991
avoid each other like the plague,
and that's exactly the right thing to 

120
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:41,501
do,
and so one of the really useful things 

121
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,741
to understand,
and this took me a long time to 

122
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:44,741
formulate properly,
you know,

123
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:45,680
you hear the terror management theorists
for example,

124
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:50,180
and they have this idea that you're,
you're meaning representation.

125
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:54,590
The story you tell about the world 
regulates your death anxiety.

126
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,840
It's something like that,
but that's not right.

127
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,120
I mean it's close to right and it's a 
smart idea.

128
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,800
It came from Ernest Becker,
by the way,

129
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,480
who wrote a book called the denial of 
death,

130
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,880
which is actually quite a good book even
though it's wrong,

131
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,400
you know,
sometimes a book can be very useful.

132
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,490
It can be usefully wrong in that,
and Becker's book is usefully wrong 

133
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,580
because he thought that it's the 
internal representation of your belief 

134
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:23,621
system that regulates your anxiety and 
that anxiety is fundamentally in the 

135
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:26,090
final analysis anxiety about death.
It's like,

136
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:27,170
well,
okay,

137
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:30,410
fine.
It's a reasonable proposition,

138
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:32,120
but that isn't how it works.
You see,

139
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,720
it isn't my beliefs right now that are 
regulating my emotions.

140
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,950
It's the fact that I'm acting out those 
beliefs which include implicit 

141
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,080
perceptions.
I'm acting them out and so are you,

142
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,860
and so what you're doing and what I 
expect more,

143
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,530
more accurately,
what you're doing and what I want you to

144
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:55,400
do and the way I want you to react to me
that's working,

145
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,360
so it's the match between my belief 
system and the way everyone else is 

146
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,160
acting that's regulating my emotions.
It's not the belief system.

147
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,570
It's mediated by the social culture and 
you see if you understand this,

148
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:13,250
then you understand more particularly 
white people are willing to fight to the

149
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:15,110
bitter end to protect their culture.

150
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,170
It's not a psychological structure that 
they're protecting.

151
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,620
It's a psychological structure and a 
sociological structures simultaneously,

152
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,990
so the social contract is you have a set
of expectations and I have a set of 

153
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,130
expectations.
There actually desires.

154
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,460
They're not merely expectations because 
as living creatures,

155
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:39,461
we're desirous,
we don't just expect and so you desire 

156
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:43,201
and outcome and I desire outcome and we 
agree to act in accordance with that.

157
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:48,670
That's the social contract,
and so people don't like to having that 

158
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:48,670
disrupted.
Well,

159
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,110
it isn't because it's psychologically 
destabilizes them.

160
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,260
Although it does.
It's because it actually destabilizes 

161
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,490
stuff,
right?

162
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:01,491
If all of a sudden we can't occupy the 
same specified domain of territory,

163
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,820
it isn't only that we're thrown into 
psychological disarray,

164
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:10,821
although we will be.
It's that will start fighting with each 

165
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:11,790
other like,
and that can kill you.

166
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,160
It's no joke.
It kills people a lot.

167
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,310
Like it happens.
It can happen very easily,

168
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:22,311
that are cohesive.
Social Group can fragment along some 

169
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:22,770
fracture line of identity,
let's say,

170
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,340
and all hell breaks loose.
You know,

171
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,250
that's what happened with the Tutsis and
the Hutu and in,

172
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,020
uh,
in Rwanda,

173
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,050
you know,
and those things can get out of control 

174
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,240
just so fast.
It's just unbelievable.

175
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,330
And so,
and that wasn't death anxiety,

176
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:41,790
that was death.
That's a whole different thing.

177
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,180
And that's the other thing that terror 
management people don't exactly get.

178
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,210
It's like it isn't just that your 
culture and your cultural beliefs 

179
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,720
protect you from anxiety and say anxiety
about death.

180
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:56,721
Even it's that they actually protect you
from death as well as protecting you 

181
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,450
from death,
anxiety.

182
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:58,050
I mean,
look,

183
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,520
it's warm in here.
It's cold outside.

184
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,590
The fact that the culture is intact 
means that you're not outside freezing.

185
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,120
That's a hell of a lot more fundamental 
in some sense than mere anxiety.

186
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:15,570
Although I'm not trying to underplay the
role of anxiety,

187
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:20,571
that's a major issue,
but there's something that's a lot more 

188
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:21,090
fundamental at stake than mere 
psychology,

189
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,420
so it's the match between your map of 
the world and other people's actions 

190
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:31,350
that regulates your emotion and it 
regulates it completely.
