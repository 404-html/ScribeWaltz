1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,740
Citizens have the inalienable right to 
benefit from the results of their own 

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:06,740
illness.
Labor.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,340
That's a good one.
Yes.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,850
That's a conservative truism.
You know why?

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,980
Well,
it isn't because you,

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,490
because you're goodhearted and you want 
them to have money.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,700
It's because they'll work if you let 
them benefit from the work and you want 

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,540
them to work because if they work then 
they do things that you need.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,750
It's as simple as that.
It's self interest and it's the right 

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:29,910
kind of self interest.
So if you work hard,

11
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:31,620
it's like great.
Have your money,

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,800
you know,
and you hear people all the time talking

13
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:37,890
about how corrupt our society is and how
the one percent,

14
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:39,960
you know,
occupies this pinnacle position.

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,230
You know,
the one percent turns over pretty damn 

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:45,420
fast just so you know it.
So you have about a 10 percent chance of

17
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,640
spending at least one year in the top.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,490
One percent chance during your life.
I think that's right.

19
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:52,470
I think it's 10 percent.
It might be higher than that,

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,760
but it's fast.
It does.

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,550
The one percent is stable as a 
phenomena,

22
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:59,400
but it turns over very rapidly in terms 
of who occupies it,

23
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,580
and it's the same in every society.
The wealth is always distributed 

24
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,460
inequitably.
It's a natural law.

25
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:08,730
You can look it up.
It was discovered by a guy named Wilfred

26
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,960
Prieto back in the late 18.
Hundreds.

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,650
Goods tend to dominate to distribute 
themselves inequitably.

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,740
It can be a problem,
but it doesn't mean that there's 

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,901
something fundamentally corrupt about 
the social structure that's driving it 

30
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:24,261
in that direction and like you,
you don't want some filthy rich geniuses

31
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:29,331
lying around like maybe you do.
Let me look at what Elon Musk is doing 

32
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:32,691
for God sake,
maybe he should have 10 times as much 

33
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:32,691
money as he has.

34
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:34,800
He's going to launch a rocket every five
days to Mars in the next 10 years,

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,040
right?
He wants to wipe out fossil fuel cars 

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,550
and he might do it.
He wants to revolutionize the 

37
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:43,550
transportation system and he might do 
it.

38
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,680
He wants to put us on the damn solar 
grid with his new batteries and he might

39
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:47,310
do it.
It's like,

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,620
oh no,
he has a couple of billion dollars.

41
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,050
Well God only knows what he's going to 
produce with that.

42
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,350
It's like,
so obviously there's going to be some 

43
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,970
corrupt.
There's gonna be some corrupt rich 

44
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,650
plutocrats who do nothing but smoke 
cigars and snort cocaine.

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,330
They're not going to live very long 
anyways,

46
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,510
but there's lots of people out there who
have the money they have because they 

47
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,420
would really like to do interesting and 
creative things with it.

48
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,240
Not because they're interested in 
gathering more,

49
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,450
you know,
paper money to stuff in their mattress 

50
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,010
and to like to feel the smooth,
the smooth delight of gold coins between

51
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,230
their fingers before they go to bed.

52
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,230
Like what kind of attitude is that 
towards people who've made their 

53
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,230
fortune?
You know,

54
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,540
you think that about Steve Jobs.
You think about Bill Gates.

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,560
I mean,
good God,

56
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:33,180
I don't know how those people make a lot
of money,

57
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:35,730
but man,
thank God they were around.

58
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:40,731
You know,
they've given us some tools that are 

59
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:40,731
just absolutely unbelievable.
So you know,

60
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:44,910
maybe we could leave the jealousy of the
successful behind for a while and notice

61
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:49,911
now and then that some of the people who
got to where they are actually deserved 

62
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:51,510
to get to where they are and we should 
be thankful that they exist.

63
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,690
That would be nice.
A little gratitude and that's a good 

64
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,721
conservative value to.
It is more noble to teach young people 

65
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,070
about responsibilities down about 
rights.

66
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,260
That's a good conservative message.
It's like you have a son or you have a 

67
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,050
daughter and you say,
bloody well grow up.

68
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,050
Stand on your own two feet and make 
something of yourself right so that I 

69
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,411
can be proud of you when you come over.
And so that may be your useful in a 

70
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:21,070
crisis.
It's like pick up your damn load and,

71
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,190
and,
and shoulder it and do something useful.

72
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,610
And,
and forget about your damn rights for 

73
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,681
awhile.
You can think about what it is that you 

74
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:34,021
should be doing to benefit yourself and 
your family and society and you'll find 

75
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:34,660
some purpose in your life because of 
that.

76
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,250
And so,
well,

77
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:41,251
that's a counter position to the 
perpetrators of the endless rights 

78
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:41,440
buffet,
right?

79
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,390
Well,
as long as we give you enough rights,

80
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,800
you're going to be what?
Free.

81
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,300
You're going to be happy.
It's like,

82
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:48,730
yeah,
sure you'll drown in a sea of chaos.

83
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,770
And that's what's happening to people 
now too.

84
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,190
So.
And that's why young people are so 

85
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,190
hungry to have someone talk to them 
about responsibilities.

86
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,830
Here's another one.
Radical change should be viewed with 

87
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,831
suspicion,
particularly in a time of radical 

88
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:04,831
change.
Okay?

89
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,440
There's never been a time in the history
of the world where things are changing 

90
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,560
as fast as they are now.
And not only are they changing fast,

91
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,210
the rate at which they're changing is 
increasing.

92
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:19,211
Like we're moving fast forward at such a
rate that it's unbelievable.

93
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,300
You can't even keep up.
I don't care what discipline you're in.

94
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,890
It's like it's not so bad to have some 
people putting their feet in the ground.

95
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,420
They're digging their heels in and say,
look,

96
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,080
we got a lot to swallow already.
We've got a lot to chew on and Digest.

97
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,200
Let's not muck about with everything 
that's worked so far,

98
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:40,290
what has worked,
not such a bad idea for people to have 

99
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,610
long term families,
right?

100
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,010
We could say,
let's try to support the family.

101
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,190
We could even say,
let's try to support the traditional 

102
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,190
family.
Why?

103
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,120
Well,
maybe boys and girls need role models of

104
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:54,490
each sex.
I know that's a terrible thing to say,

105
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:59,491
but it is possible.
It's certainly the case too that intact 

106
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:03,301
two parent families have children that 
thrive more than broken families and 

107
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,830
broken families or a catastrophe for 
everyone.

108
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:06,760
Now you might say,
well,

109
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,280
I shouldn't stay with someone that I 
don't get along with,

110
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:10,150
and it's like,
yeah,

111
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:10,930
yeah,
fair enough.

112
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:13,930
Except that there is no one that you're 
ever going to find to stay with it.

113
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:15,640
You're going to get along with all of 
the time,

114
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,330
especially in your shoddy condition,
and so you're lucky that anybody.

115
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:24,331
Oh,
you're lucky that anybody will put up 

116
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:24,331
with him for a week much less your whole
life.

117
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:29,010
It's like the point of marriage is to 
tough it out and you don't tough it out 

118
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,010
for your happiness.

119
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,870
That's not what you're in there for,
your tough it out so that you have 

120
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,050
someone to tie the rope of your life 
together with.

121
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,140
You have a chance to tie the rope of 
your life together with the rope of 

122
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,070
someone else's life and to make it 
strong and to make a place that children

123
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:47,071
can have some security and some 
encouragement and thereby contribute to 

124
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:50,530
the future and pay for the miracle of 
your birth and your own raising.

125
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:55,531
That's why you get married and there's 
no reason that conservatives can stand 

126
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:55,540
up and say,
look,

127
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,700
we're willing to tolerate alternative 
family arrangements,

128
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,880
but when you start making the claim that
the traditional family unit is just 

129
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,430
another construct and that it's not 
something fundamental to our polity,

130
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:10,610
it's like that's.
You've taken your damn argument too far.

131
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,310
First of all,
you have no evidence whatsoever for that

132
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,440
claim and there's plenty of counter 
evidence.

133
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,250
So,
you know,

134
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,920
one of the things the postmodernists 
basically say is,

135
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,840
you know,
every time you stand up for something,

136
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:22,820
you're also standing against something.
It's like,

137
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,380
yeah,
that's true,

138
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,410
but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't
stand up for things.

139
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,380
And I think if,
if there is something that conservatives

140
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,660
could agree on that we could stand up 
for,

141
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,990
it's the nuclear family now.
Exactly how that's gonna play out.

142
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:38,550
I don't exactly know,
but it's nothing to.

143
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,030
It's not anything to be ashamed of to 
say,

144
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,180
wow,
it kind of looks like that structures 

145
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,180
work quite well for the entire duration 
of mankind.

146
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,140
And so maybe we mess with it at our 
apparel.

147
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,990
Here's another one.
The government,

148
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,700
local and distant should leave people to
their own devices as much as possible.

149
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,350
Why?
Well,

150
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,470
part of it's just humility.
It's like I'd rather that there was a 

151
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,060
million of you out there making your own
stupid mistakes so that maybe a thousand

152
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:16,061
of you can get it right then for one of 
you to impose their view on everyone and

153
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:20,360
risk getting it catastrophic,
wrong for everyone at the same time.

154
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,450
And that's really the alternative.
Like if you're a social scientist,

155
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:26,250
like I mean an actual scientist,
I don't mean a bloody idiot log.

156
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,460
One of the things that you learned very 
rapidly,

157
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,530
as you know,
you do a simple experiment.

158
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:32,650
You think you're going to predict some 
element of human behavior,

159
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,660
so here's my hypothesis.
I'm going to put people in this 

160
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:37,730
experimental situation and this is what 
they're going to do,

161
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,160
and then you run the experiment and they
don't do that.

162
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,520
They do something completely different.
You find out that even though what you 

163
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,050
have them do is really simple,
you don't have a clue what they're up to

164
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,050
and that's just a tiny little controlled
experiment about one little tiny thing 

165
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,810
and you're wrong.
It's like

166
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,470
one of the great advantages to 
conservative philosophy is that it's 

167
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,920
humble.
It's humble from,

168
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:08,921
uh,
from the perspective of social 

169
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:08,921
experimentation.
It's like,

170
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,140
it's not like everything's great and we 
should just continue going the way we're

171
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,130
going.
It's like,

172
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,880
well,
everything isn't as broken as it might 

173
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,401
be and I'm kind of stupid and blind and 
all I have is a bat and probably hitting

174
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:21,740
it isn't going to make it any better.
Oh,

175
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,780
I'll do is shatter it.
And so the conservative says it's 

176
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:26,780
working

177
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,050
quiet,
sneak away.

178
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:35,170
Maybe it'll keep working.
And that's a perfectly reasonable 

179
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,081
perspective.
Now obviously sometimes things have to 

180
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:40,271
change,
but the conservative can come up and 

181
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,371
say,
don't be thinking that you have so much 

182
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:45,431
evidence that what you're doing is right
or that it will have the outcome that 

183
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:45,990
you expected.
I'll tell you a quick story,

184
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:50,991
and this was told to me by a woman named
Joan mccord who was one of the world's 

185
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:51,410
first female criminologist,
by the way,

186
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:53,990
a phd from temple,
University of a genius level,

187
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,510
genius level person.
Very tremendous integrity,

188
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,320
tough,
tough,

189
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,380
tough person.
She did a study in a place called 

190
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,841
Somerville in the United States in 
Massachusetts in the 19 thirties famous 

191
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:05,841
study,
and so here is the deal.

192
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,940
They'd identified a bunch of inner city 
kids in rough neighborhoods and felt 

193
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,520
that they were more likely to be on a 
criminal track,

194
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,470
criminal antisocial,
undereducated,

195
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,060
alcoholic,
the whole,

196
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,650
the whole dismal,
wretched,

197
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:19,410
underclass phenomena thing was going on.
And so they thought,

198
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:20,940
well,
let's do an intervention.

199
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:25,941
Let's set up programs to help these kids
and see if we can see if we can change 

200
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:27,790
their developmental pathway.
So

201
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,880
they designed to find study.
Man,

202
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,060
I had the kids.
I'll get the details wrong,

203
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:37,100
but I got the.
I got the story right.

204
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,640
They had the kids,
they made them more literate.

205
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,550
They educated the more they had their 
parents take training courses.

206
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,700
They did social skills training like 
they did all sorts of things to try to 

207
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,021
make the kids' lives turn out better and
to top it all off because the kids were 

208
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:55,730
stuck in the inner city.
I took them all out to summer camp for a

209
00:09:55,731 --> 00:10:00,731
couple of weeks,
a year and so they could get away from 

210
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:03,191
the city and you know,
enjoy the countryside and have a little 

211
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:03,770
bit of a vacation,
a little taste of a higher quality life.

212
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah.
So great.

213
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,740
Everyone's thrilled with the damn 
program.

214
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,420
The kids are having a great time at 
camp.

215
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,340
The counselors do thrilled the 
psychologists.

216
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,780
They think they're doing a wonderful 
job.

217
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,910
Great.
It's working beautifully.

218
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,080
Except then they did the data analysis.
Guess what happened?

219
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,840
The kids in the.
In the treatment group,

220
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:21,980
there was a control group,
right?

221
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:24,470
That didn't get all this special 
treatment randomly assigned.

222
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:29,471
It was a very nice experiment.
The kids in the treatment group did 

223
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:31,190
worse on virtually everything that was 
measured worse.

224
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,780
Why

225
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,440
don't put out any social kids together 
in the same camp for two weeks during 

226
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,600
the year.
Right?

227
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Right.
Because what happens is that the bad 

228
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:44,660
kids teach the slightly less bad kids to
be worse.

229
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,490
It's a well documented phenomenon.
That's why what happens in prisons 

230
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,751
happens in prisons.
What we do with criminals is the worst 

231
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,140
thing you could possibly do to criminals
if you don't want them to continue to be

232
00:10:55,141 --> 00:11:00,141
criminals,
except for the fact that you keep them 

233
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:00,141
in there until they're old enough,
generally speaking,

234
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:01,560
so they're less likely to engage in 
criminal activity,

235
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,770
but what was learned from the Somerville
study was don't be so sure your good 

236
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,221
intentions are going to produce the 
results that you intend because they 

237
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:13,161
probably won't and they probably won't 
for reasons that you never even 

238
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:13,161
imagined,
and the other one was

239
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,260
don't group bad kids with good kids on 
the assumption that the good kids will 

240
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,430
make the bad kids better because that 
isn't what happens.

241
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,580
What happens is the reverse.
If you put two or three bad kids with a 

242
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,910
bunch of good kids,
then the good kids get worse.

243
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,970
The bad kids don't get better.
Very well documented social science 

244
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,361
finding,
well the reason I'm telling you the 

245
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:36,361
Somerville story is because God who 
could argue with that study,

246
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,620
right?
It's like these kids were poor.

247
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,240
They were struggling.
It's like you want to.

248
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,880
You want to lift them up,
you want to make their life better.

249
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:47,881
You do this wonderful expensive,
well motivated experiment and then you 

250
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:52,711
run the damn data analysis and you find 
out that there was one thing wrong with 

251
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,741
your social intervention philosophy that
didn't understand and you actually made 

252
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:55,741
it worse.
Well,

253
00:11:55,741 --> 00:11:57,910
that's a and so Joel,
Joel Mccord,

254
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:01,450
she spent much of the rest of her life 
going around telling social scientists.

255
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,540
When you run a social experiment,
politicians,

256
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,790
the same thing when you run a social 
experiment,

257
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,790
especially on a large number of people,
especially without their consent,

258
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:15,210
then gather the data and do the followup
study because it's highly probable that 

259
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:20,131
you'll find that what you did didn't 
work or maybe it even worked backwards 

260
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,160
and you'll never know that unless you do
this study,

261
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,310
and so what people took away from that,
the social intervention is types took 

262
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,200
away from that was whatever you do with 
your social intervention policy,

263
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,930
don't run the study.
Right,

264
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,060
right.
That was the wrong lesson,

265
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:34,630
by the way.
