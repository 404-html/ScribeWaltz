1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,120
So imagine this,
you know,

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,190
you get up in the morning,
you do a bunch of things and someone 

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,550
asks you what you're doing,
what you did and you,

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,150
you know,
you tell them,

5
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:16,151
well the first thing I did this morning 
was open my eyes and the second thing 

6
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,990
was thinking about whether I wanted to 
go back to sleep and then,

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,780
you know,
I took off my blankets and then I put my

8
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,800
feet on the floor and then I stood up 
and I was blinking while I was doing all

9
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,990
this and I was also breathing.
And then,

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,600
you know,
I looked for my claw and you really want

11
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,970
to listen to that guy.
You don't want to listen to that guy.

12
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,020
It's like,
why do you,

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,230
why are you telling me that?
I want you to tell me something 

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:38,440
interesting.
Well,

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,390
what is it that's interesting and why 
isn't that interesting?

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,190
It's not obvious.
So,

17
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,350
so then imagine the guy actually tells 
you a pretty good story and a little 

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,160
adventure.
Probably he was doing something normal.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,160
Something unexpected happened.
He had to conjure up some new responses 

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,880
and he either settled the problem or 
didn't settle the problem.

21
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:00,290
Yeah,
you're interested in that.

22
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,730
Especially if he settled the problem 
because if he can tell you how when he 

23
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,550
encountered some unexplored territory,
he was able to sew it back together,

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,240
then maybe you can do that when that 
thing happens and how it's pretty cheap 

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,240
wisdom for you.
It's.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,520
He had to go through all the aggravation
of figuring it out.

27
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:19,790
No,
you have to do is listen.

28
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,700
You know,
and that's kind of a classic story.

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,850
Classic Story.
Roughly speaking is there's a guy or 

30
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,850
woman,
doesn't matter,

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,330
go into both their life relatively 
normally,

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,600
something blindsides them and they're in
a state of chaos.

33
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,110
Chaos is the place.
Chaos is the place that you end up when 

34
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,450
what you're doing and the world stopped 
matching and the chaos can be of 

35
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:51,770
different degrees.

36
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,770
You know,
you could wake up and find that your 

37
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,901
house was burgled and you could wake up 
and find that a parent has your parent 

38
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,530
has Alzheimer's or some fatal disease or
that you do,

39
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,830
or that your whole family was murdered 
or that there's a war starting or you 

40
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,521
know there's different degrees of chaos 
and I think you can quantify the chaos 

41
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:17,831
by calculating how much of what you do 
and expect is likely to be disrupted by 

42
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:25,511
the event now because that the more 
disruption,

43
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,260
the more destabilized you're going to 
be,

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,440
which is why if,
if someone tells you that you're going 

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,771
to perish painfully in three months,
it's like that's a bad one.

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,580
You're really in an unexpected territory
there.

47
00:02:40,581 --> 00:02:45,581
Nothing that you assumed that was real.
Roughly speaking in the world is real 

48
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:51,161
anymore.
We like to watch people in their normal 

49
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:56,331
life blindsided by something,
experiencing this inter regnum of where 

50
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:04,891
they explore and gather new information 
and retooled their character or retool 

51
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:10,811
the world because you could either of 
those would work as a solution and then 

52
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,900
come out the other side and things are 
better than they were to begin with,

53
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,480
or at least as good,
but better is better.

54
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,830
That's a happy ending,
right?

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,900
That's a happy ending.
That's a comedy,

56
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,950
technically speaking,
and so

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,850
what you want.
You want your life to be a comedy.

58
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,630
Not that it's supposed to be funny 
because comedy doesn't have to be funny 

59
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,740
technically speaking.
It's just the opposite of tragedy.

60
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,890
Tragedy is when you're going along 
pretty well and you get blindsided and 

61
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,640
that's that and you know that can 
certainly happen.

62
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:43,400
It happens to people all the time,
but it's a comedy you want.

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,620
Now what I hope to provide you with,
is there a magic code?

64
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,680
You know,
there was a book published a while back.

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Tom Hanks was in the movie who was a 
harvard professor who went around 

66
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,650
solving symbolic mysteries.
Do you remember what?

67
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,690
What was it called,
the Davinci Code.

68
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,340
Everyone liked that.
It sold a lot and you know,

69
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:23,341
it was a little mysteries and it's full 
of hints that there was more to the 

70
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:26,881
world than you think and which is 
definitely true and that,

71
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,460
you know,
there was a way of getting access to 

72
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,100
that knowledge and then it would really 
be worthwhile and people liked that.

73
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,130
They liked that idea.
And the reason for that is because it's 

74
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:38,130
actually,
it's true,

75
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,280
it's true.
It's true.

76
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,530
Like,
like fiction is true.

77
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:49,531
So okay,
let's go back to the guy who's telling 

78
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:49,531
you about his morning.
Well,

79
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:53,371
he tells you something exciting.
Well then imagine that 10 people tell 

80
00:04:53,371 --> 00:04:58,201
you something exciting and then you 
extract out the pattern of them dealing 

81
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:01,660
with this problem from that.

82
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,330
And so then you have a.
that's what you do if you're an author,

83
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,550
right?
Because in a,

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,640
in a book,
you don't want the book exactly to be 

85
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,480
about what ordinary people do in 
ordinary times in their life.

86
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,510
It's like you already know how to be 
ordinary during ordinary times of your 

87
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:18,510
life.
What?

88
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,840
That's not useful.
You know,

89
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:22,180
you wouldn't watch a video tape of 
yourself.

90
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Imagine you videotaped yourself during a
day and then the next day you watched 

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,020
that.
It's like God,

92
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,260
who would want to do that?
So what seems to happen in stories is 

93
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,010
that they distill,
they distill,

94
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,310
so they watch people,
people watch people and then they tell 

95
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,091
stories about what they see,
but they leave a lot out of those 

96
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:45,460
stories.
Everything that's boring hopefully,

97
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,120
and then more and more stories about 
exciting things get sort of aggregated 

98
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,010
and then maybe a great writer comes 
along and write something really,

99
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:58,100
really interesting,
profound character transformations,

100
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,240
and then you say,
well,

101
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,800
that's fiction.
And then you say,

102
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,230
well,
that's not true because it's fiction,

103
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,320
but then then maybe that's not right.

104
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,380
Maybe it's more than true because who 
wants the truth?

105
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,500
The truth is mundane reality and you've 
already got that mastered.

106
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,770
What you want is the distillation of 
interesting experience and you might 

107
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:22,340
think,
well,

108
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,930
why is it interesting?
Well,

109
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:27,470
that's a really good question because 
you don't actually know and believe me,

110
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:32,471
you really don't know because you'll be 
interested in things that just don't 

111
00:06:32,471 --> 00:06:35,351
make any sense at all.
I'm going to walk you a bit today 

112
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,470
through Pinocchio and we'll do that more
the next time to,

113
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,390
you know,
but I want to tell you a little bit 

114
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,390
about that movie to begin with,
just so you know,

115
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,570
how crazy you are.
So you know the plot.

116
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,070
How many people have seen the Disney 
movie?

117
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,980
Pinocchio?
Okay.

118
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,990
So lots of people.
So that's strange enough in itself that 

119
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,800
so many people have seen it and it's 
worth thinking about.

120
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:59,801
You know,
you tend to show your kids that moody 

121
00:06:59,801 --> 00:06:59,801
and.
But do you think about the movie?

122
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:04,391
It's,
you're doing some pretty weird things 

123
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:04,391
when you're sitting there watching that 
movie,

124
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,120
man,
first of all,

125
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,340
it's drawings,
right?

126
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:10,310
And they're low resolution drawings.
You don't care.

127
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,900
And you watch the simpsons or maybe fit 
or a.

128
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,760
what's that called?

129
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,790
The the one that's been concentrating on
political correctness so much south 

130
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,790
park.
God,

131
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,520
that animation man,
it's just awful,

132
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,260
right?
It's just horrible.

133
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:29,261
It couldn't be worse.
You don't care like round heads smile,

134
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,610
a little bit of shuffling.
That's a person as far as your concern 

135
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,160
is just irrelevant.
And if it was higher resolution it 

136
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,860
wouldn't help.
You just need the bare bones,

137
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,290
right?
Dang your perceptions on.

138
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,190
So.
So you watch this drawing that's been 

139
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,750
oakeel beautiful drawings,
animated in a sequence.

140
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,260
You don't watching something real,
you're watching a pure construction and 

141
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,390
then you think about the plot.
It's like it's completely absurd.

142
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,370
Everything about it is observed.
It's like,

143
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,730
well one of the characters is a bug and 
he turns out to be like the conscience 

144
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:11,591
and so what the hell is up with that?
And then another character is this 

145
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:17,261
puppet Marionette and you know,
somehow he gets free of his strings and 

146
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:20,840
then goes on this adventure and then 
which is.

147
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,260
And then he gets enticed into various 
nefarious places by a Fox and a cat.

148
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,670
And then he rescues his father from a 
whale and you don't even know I was 

149
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,580
father God in the way.
Oh,

150
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,140
it's like the last time you see his 
father,

151
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:41,141
he was in a rainstorm and the next thing
that happens is he's in a whale and 

152
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:41,380
you're sitting there thinking,
Hey,

153
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,040
no problem.
This all makes sense.

154
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:43,940
It's like,
what?

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,250
Really?
Why?

156
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,070
How does that make sense?
Well,

157
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:53,240
the answer is you don't know.
That's the thing that's so cool.

158
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,980
You don't know.
You don't even know what you're,

159
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,190
but it doesn't matter.
You Watch it and you're interested in 

160
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,190
it.
You want to see what the hell happens to

161
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,720
this puppet.
You want to see if he ends up becoming a

162
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:07,410
real boy because there's.
It's seems important.

163
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,130
Well,
I to say,

164
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:12,000
well,
let's Pinocchio.

165
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,920
True.
Oh,

166
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:21,921
that's a stupid question.
It's partly a stupid question because 

167
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,810
the answer is it depends what you mean 
by true

168
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,340
and

169
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,530
it isn't obvious to me what you should 
mean

170
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,510
when you

171
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,600
say that something's true and I.
The reason it's not obvious is because 

172
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,230
we have this idea in our society and 
it's.

173
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,890
It's a very profound idea and that idea 
is that the ultimate truth is scientific

174
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:55,891
truth that that tells us that about the 
nature of the world and it does that in 

175
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,520
a final way.
In some sense there is no brooking any 

176
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,191
arguments about it and the physicists 
have got it right and that's why they 

177
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:07,450
can make hydrogen bombs and that's a 
pretty good demonstration of their being

178
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:12,451
right,
but you don't act as if that's true

179
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,790
and you don't,

180
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,340
and you watch things and pay attention 
to things in are captivated by things 

181
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,480
that aren't predicated on those 
assumptions and it seems to me that

182
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,720
there is a problem of what the world is 
made out of,

183
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:42,721
but there's a bigger problem and that's 
the problem of how you should conduct 

184
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,160
yourself in the world.
And that's really what you want to know.

185
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,330
People want to know that more than 
anything because you need to know.

186
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,190
It's like here you guys are in 
university.

187
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:52,540
It's like you don't know what you're 
doing.

188
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,370
I mean,
some of you know more than others,

189
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,960
but you're at the beginning of your life
and life is very complex and chaotic and

190
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,030
it isn't exactly obvious.
You know,

191
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:06,060
how,
what kind of relationship you should 

192
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,741
form or what sort of character you 
should develop or what you're going to 

193
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:09,250
do for a job or how.
What's the meaning of life?

194
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,350
That's a good one.
What's the meaning of life?

195
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,410
Well,
and you know,

196
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,570
people come to university,
at least many of them and that's kind of

197
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:17,620
what they want to find out.
