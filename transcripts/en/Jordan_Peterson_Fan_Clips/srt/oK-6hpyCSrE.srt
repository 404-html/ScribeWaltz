1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
And so as far as I'm concerned,
the working class needs a voice

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,250
and

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,430
it isn't obvious that they have one at 
the moment.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,670
Having said that,
however,

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,640
it isn't obvious to me at all

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,030
that the people who purport to stand for
the working class actually do so or that

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,570
if they do so,
that the reason they do so is because 

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,270
they're all compassionate and 
sympathetic and loving and kind and St.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,890
like I'm more convinced by Orwell's 
argument.

10
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:41,891
So back to the NDP,
the people I met at the leadership 

11
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:46,481
level,
a lot of them I had a fair bit of 

12
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:49,631
admiration for.
But as I worked with the party over 

13
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:52,991
about a five year period,
there's this contradiction that Cape 

14
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:57,160
kept emerging for me.
And that was that I didn't really like 

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,290
the low level party functionary activist
types.

16
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,810
Like they just weren't personally 
appealing to me.

17
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,990
They seem peevish and resentful.
And then at the same time I was going to

18
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:06,710
college,
I was about 17.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,370
I got elected to the Senate on the 
College Board of Governors.

20
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:14,840
And at that time Alberta was 
conservative politically right?

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,860
It still is of course,
but they.

22
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,150
It was part of the progressive 
conservative empire because they ruled 

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Alberta forever and all the board of 
governor members were basically 

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,540
nominees,
right?

25
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:34,541
They were conservative nominees,
so these were conservative people and I 

26
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,710
was an NDP member and I thought when I'd
worked for small business men too,

27
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:38,120
who weren't NDP,
they were.

28
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,100
They were conserved.
I've never figured that out.

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,170
I'll tell you about that in a minute,
but I had a bad case of cognitive 

30
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,511
dissonance because actually turned out 
that I admired the people on the board 

31
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:50,180
of governors and they were mostly.
It was in grand prairie.

32
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,190
It's not a very big place and it's not 
very old.

33
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:56,480
And so if you were reasonably successful
in grand prairie,

34
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,540
the probability that you would inherited
your money from the arrest to across 

35
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,320
aristocracy was zero because there 
wasn't one.

36
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,230
Right.
The whole damn town was 50 years old.

37
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,060
So if you had any influencer or wealth,
you are a small businessman,

38
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:13,040
small to middle sized businessmen and 
you'd.

39
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,330
You knew what you were doing.
And I actually admired these people and 

40
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,330
I thought,
well,

41
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,711
that's not very good.
I mire them and I don't share their 

42
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:23,870
political views.
And then there's these other people with

43
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:27,650
whom I hypothetically share political 
views and I don't admire them at all.

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,530
What's going on?
And then I read road to Wigan pier and I

45
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:31,760
thought,
oh,

46
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,930
that's it.

47
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,940
They don't like the poor.
They just hate the rich.

48
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,240
It's not the same thing.
It's not the same set of motivations.

49
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,450
And so let's say that you're a 
postmodernist and you privileged 

50
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,810
compassion for the oppressed.
Think,

51
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:52,340
well,
what do you pushed to the margins?

52
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Well,
what are you doing with all your hatred 

53
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,980
and your resentment and your evil?
It's like you don't any of that.

54
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,560
That's a bad theory.
That's a really bad theory.

55
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,400
Okay,
so fine.

56
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,110
So you can say,
well yeah,

57
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,780
you can say that,
but I don't buy it.

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,840
I still think that the people who stand 
to speak for the oppressed are in fact 

59
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,360
motivated by empathy and sympathy.
Their hearts are in the right place.

60
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,730
See,
I don't really buy that either because I

61
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:28,731
don't really think generally speaking 
that it's a credible claim for someone 

62
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:31,560
to make that their heart is in the right
place.

63
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Now you can ask that of yourself and if 
you think your heart is in the right 

64
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,170
place,
well more power to you.

65
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:38,970
You know,
I,

66
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,070
I,
I can't see the halo from here.

67
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,100
However,
and so given that you're just as 

68
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:53,301
malevolent as your neighbor or maybe 
even more so and that that's actually 

69
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:58,440
pretty malevolent given the intrinsic 
nature of human beings.

70
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,770
I can't help but wonder what you're 
doing with all those traits that you're 

71
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,570
not admitting to,
but you can.

72
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,540
You could even object.
Well,

73
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:14,541
you know,
that's a pretty pessimistic view of 

74
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:14,541
human kind.
It's not by the way,

75
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,750
it's just not naive,
but anyways,

76
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,970
you could object that and you can say 
no.

77
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:21,690
Actually,
the weight of moral authority is in fact

78
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,220
on the left,
the radical left with those who identify

79
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:28,570
with the oppressed and who are working 
better,

80
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:31,450
their conditions.
Okay,

81
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,900
fair enough.
So then let's say,

82
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:41,901
well,
let's give those people some power and 

83
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:45,861
if they're actually motivated by 
compassion and empathy and desire for 

84
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:49,521
the working class,
if you give them power and you give the 

85
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:51,480
ideas power,
then as those ideas unfold in real time,

86
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,150
you're going to find out better for the 
working class,

87
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,400
let's say,
or did they get worse?

88
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,090
Because we could.
We could consider that like an 

89
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,530
experiment.
We could consider the come proof.

90
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,620
I don't know what else you would do.
I don't know how else you would.

91
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,920
You would come to your decision because 
it's just theory until you see it 

92
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:12,920
happen.

93
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,110
Now.
Niches sat back in the 18,

94
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:21,890
late 18 hundreds that after he said that
God was dead.

95
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,360
And I suppose that would also mean the 
theory that of suffering that I outlined

96
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,500
at the beginning that is that the basis 
of Judeo Christian civilization,

97
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,070
the Guard was dad in the people had 
killed him and that we'd never find 

98
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,610
enough water to wash away the blood.
It's a paraphrase.

99
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:40,290
But I,
I've got the basic message,

100
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:45,291
right?
And he also said there'll be two 

101
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,481
consequences of that nihilism because 
there's no transcendent meaning and a 

102
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:53,130
move to totalitarianism because people 
can't tolerate nihilism.

103
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,790
He said the most likely pathway to 
totalitarianism would communism.

104
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,920
Essentially.
He didn't quite use those words,

105
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:01,280
but

106
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,690
he meant that

107
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,240
he words are close enough.
He said socialism,

108
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,570
but I'm going to use communism to 
distinguishing it,

109
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,680
distinguish it from Democratic 
Socialism.

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,040
And he said that probably tens of tens 
of millions of people would die in the 

111
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,190
20th century as we played out that 
experiment.

112
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,550
And then he said,
but it might be worth it if we learn 

113
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:25,550
something from it.

114
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,350
Rough man.
I mean,

115
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,550
and,
and unbelievable.

116
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:33,551
Like I cannot figure out how in the 
world he knew that that was going to 

117
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:33,950
happen.
Especially so far in advance.

118
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:38,951
But Dostoevsky knew the same thing.
He wrote this book called the Devil's 

119
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:40,220
are the possessed.
You could read that.

120
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,850
That's a great book.
It takes about 150 pages to get going.

121
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,440
But once it like everything,
everything snaps together after that.

122
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,180
And then it moves.
And it's basically his prophecy about.

123
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,330
It's an examination of the kind of 
person who had arisen in the aftermath 

124
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,090
of the death of God in Russia who would 
lead the communist revolution.

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,460
That's essentially it.
It's brilliant.

126
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:05,060
It's,
it's,

127
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:10,061
it's terrifying,
and it's a great intro to soldier 

128
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:13,710
Knutson's Gulag archipelago,
which describes what did happen when 

129
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,380
those sort of people took over the 
revolution.

130
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,970
So let's look at what happened after the
revolution and we might say,

131
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:20,360
well,
this,

132
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,170
how about we replicate the experiment a 
few times because you know how it is.

133
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:25,910
If you're running this scientific 
experiment,

134
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,250
you want to find out what something does
if you allow it to behave,

135
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,370
you don't want to just run it once 
because while maybe there was something 

136
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,250
specific about those conditions that 
lead to the outcome.

137
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,180
You want to generalize it across 
multiple circumstances.

138
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:42,170
So we might say,
well,

139
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,410
let's take this set of ideas and let's,
uh,

140
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,250
let's run it on large scale over a very 
long period of time in a variety of 

141
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,180
exceptionally diverse cultures and 
languages.

142
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,930
So let's do that.

143
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Okay,
well we can first start with the with 

144
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,190
the Soviet people even now because it's 
like the 100th anniversary of the 

145
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,600
Russian revolution are celebrating 
Lennon.

146
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,510
It's like,
that's not good.

147
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,890
That's like celebrating Hitler.
Okay,

148
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,770
I'm dead serious about that.
It's not good,

149
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,070
and the fact that people can dare to 
think that that's okay means that 

150
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,450
there's something wrong with the way 
that we look at history.

151
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,650
Landon was a monster and if you want to 
know about that,

152
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:36,651
you can read Solzhenitsyn's writings 
about lending because they communist 

153
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:36,651
apologist say,
well,

154
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:38,040
it wasn't landing.
Lennon was a good guy.

155
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,830
He was all motivated by love of the 
working class.

156
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,700
It's like,
well,

157
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,020
his henchmen was stolen and if you're 
Hansman is Stellan,

158
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,380
you're not a good guy.
And and London was around during the 

159
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,300
early collectivization and if you read 
what he wrote,

160
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:58,380
you'll find out he is perfectly willing 
to have any number of people die as long

161
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:01,410
as his ideological system could be 
brought into big.

162
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,730
So there's no celebrating Lennon.
There's no work,

163
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:07,830
cool young Marxists,
hip revolutionaries,

164
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,190
and he's our idol.
It's like there's none of that.

165
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,460
Not if you know anything,
not if you're decent,

166
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,890
whether it's death of the Kulaks I told 
you about that there was the Ukrainian 

167
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:22,930
famine.
That's $6 million gone there.

168
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,080
There was the rise of the Gulag state 
because it turned out that Russia,

169
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,140
the Soviet Union couldn't run on the 
principles that it had that had had a 

170
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,300
laid down as sacrosanct that just didn't
work.

171
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:39,301
So you had to enslave everybody and run 
your economy as a slave state 

172
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,120
essentially.

173
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,040
And try not to kill the people into 
gulags so fast that you can't suck some 

174
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,780
productive labor out of them is the 
death of tens of millions of people.

175
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,840
We don't even know.
The estimates range from 15 to $60 

176
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,831
million and like we won't get too picky 
picayune about the numbers because after

177
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:04,841
the first 10 million you kinda made your
point and the fact that we don't know 

178
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:10,271
between 15 and 60 is actually an 
indication of the horror of it because 

179
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,900
our count is off by tens of millions and
that's only within the last century.

180
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,710
And then there was the 1956 crackdown on
Hungary and the 1968 invasion of 

181
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,601
Czechoslovakia.
Then there was the whole like thermo 

182
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:29,990
nuclear Holocaust thing that was going 
on at the same time,

183
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:34,991
and the fact that in 1962 and in 1984,
we were seconds away from complete 

184
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:38,780
annihilation,
right during the Cuban missile crisis,

185
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,610
the keys were in the intercontinental 
ballistic missile release systems.

186
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,730
And Castro,
as he admitted to Jimmy Carter in case 

187
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,870
any of you are Castro fans,
which you shouldn't be,

188
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,250
that he was perfectly willing to have 
Cuba annihilated if it would've meant 

189
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,251
the defeat of the United States.
And then in 1984 approximately,

190
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,250
I may have the date exactly wrong,
the Russians received an indication from

191
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:12,251
their early warning systems that the 
Americans had launched five Thurman 

192
00:11:12,251 --> 00:11:16,870
Nuclear Missiles and one Russian decided
that it was a mistake and refused to 

193
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:21,140
launch the retaliation.
And he just died about two weeks ago.
