1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,500
All then we have jimminy cricket,
that's south southern US slang for Jesus

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,500
Christ by the way.
And the initial overlap isn't a fluke.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,560
I mean,
I'm sure the animators thought that was 

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:15,560
funny and of course it is funny and you 
know,

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,080
in,
in the lion king,

6
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:20,820
you know that that at bat boone,
who is the shaman basically?

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,110
Well,
to begin with,

8
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,510
he was kind of just a comic relief 
character,

9
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:25,770
like a fool,
you know.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,520
But one of the things young mentioned 
about the fool,

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,840
the fool tends to turn into the savior.
It's an,

12
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,660
it's an archetypal reality.
Bugs bunny is sort of like that,

13
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:34,650
you know,
he's a trickster.

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,830
And as the,
as the movie developed,

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,370
the character of the fool,
baboons took on the full fledged,

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,480
you know,
Shaman,

17
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:45,390
priest element and,
and you know,

18
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,680
okay,
well Jimminy cricket,

19
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,950
he's this little cricket and,
and he turns out to be the conscience,

20
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:51,150
which is pretty damn weird.

21
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,150
It's like a bug is your conscience and a
bug is jc and it's like that's a very 

22
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:00,120
strange juxtaposition of ideas,
conscience,

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,240
insect,
savior.

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,830
It's like,
what,

25
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:05,790
what's up with that?
And so.

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,200
Well,
what bugs you,

27
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,190
that's part of it,
while your conscious conscience 

28
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,010
certainly bugs you and you should pay 
attention to.

29
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:17,400
It's just little niggling annoying thing
that you can't quite.

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,900
You can override it,
right?

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,640
Obviously,
but it's this swallowed.

32
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:24,900
And he says,
when he talks to Pinocchio later,

33
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,540
he says it's that still small voice,
you know,

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,540
and I've asked people before,
like in my personality class,

35
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,010
like [inaudible] conscience is a weird 
thing.

36
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:35,730
And,
and like if I said to you,

37
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,660
if you're about to do something that you
know you shouldn't do,

38
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,680
do you have a voice in your head that 
tells you that you shouldn't do it?

39
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:45,720
So how many people have had that 
experience?

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,250
Okay,
okay,

41
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:47,880
good.
Now,

42
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,520
so other people have a feeling instead 
of a voice.

43
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:53,670
And so is there anybody here who's 
willing to admit it?

44
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,220
Who has neither the feeling nor the 
voice?

45
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,650
Okay.
So,

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,740
and you know,
it's a very understudied phenomena in 

47
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:03,740
psychology.
This conscience.

48
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,671
I mean people can be conscientious and 
maybe those are people who listen to 

49
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:08,400
their conscience more.
I don't know,

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,520
but nobody's ever investigated it.
And the fact that you do have this 

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,040
little voice,
whatever it is inside your head,

52
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,810
it's like,
what the hell is up with that?

53
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,510
You know?
And it doesn't tell you what you want to

54
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:21,000
hear,
at least as far as I can tell.

55
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:21,810
Now you could say,
well,

56
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:25,650
that's the internal representation of 
society operating within you.

57
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,900
That'd be a Freudian view.
That's the Super Ego.

58
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,110
And certainly there's something to that,
but I don't think it's necessary to 

59
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:34,860
presume that that's all there is to it.

60
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,350
And even if it is,
you still wouldn't have the voice.

61
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:42,351
It's if you didn't have the biological 
potential to have that voice embedded 

62
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:46,911
itself in you.
So even if it is socio culturally 

63
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:46,950
constructed,
which it is in part,

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,280
it's like language.
It's like your language associate 

65
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,810
culturally constructed,
but the reason you can speak is because 

66
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,320
human beings can speak and if you have a
conscience,

67
00:02:55,321 --> 00:03:00,321
that's because human beings have a 
conscience and the contents of that 

68
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:02,170
might differ.
But the fact that it exists,

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,190
what seems to be to be universal,
okay,

70
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:10,420
so well that's the conscience and that's
Jimminy cricket.

71
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,120
And then click the cricket opens this 
book,

72
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:15,340
and then you look at the book and you 
think,

73
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,020
well what kind of book is that?
Well,

74
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:20,230
it's got a spotlight on it.
So it's being highlighted.

75
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,450
This is an important book.
And what kind of book is it?

76
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,830
Well,
it's leather bound.

77
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,210
It has a lock on it,
you know,

78
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,280
it's not some cheap book.
It's kind of like a,

79
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,550
you might think about,
it looks like something from an old 

80
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,550
library or maybe it looks biblical,
whatever.

81
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,261
It's a major league book.
And this bug is the introduction to the 

82
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:40,381
book.
So it does that mean your conscience is 

83
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:41,650
the introduction to the book?
Well maybe that is what it means.

84
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:46,651
It's certainly what's being played out 
in the movie while then the cricket 

85
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:47,380
opens the book.
And so then what do you see?

86
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,490
Well,
what does that look like?

87
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,480
What does it look like?
What does it remind you of?

88
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,220
Okay,
so that's the van Gogh painting.

89
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,670
It's a nativity scene.
It's the,

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,930
it's the Christmas star and you know 
that because what's going to happen?

91
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,640
Well,
the hero is going to be born.

92
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,180
That's what happens.
And so a star signifies that,

93
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,540
why does this star signify the birth of 
an infant,

94
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,860
let's say?
Well,

95
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:21,420
because there's something miraculous 
about the birth of an infant and,

96
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,560
and why would the infant be a savior,
which is the Christian notion say,

97
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,890
well,
because that's what the infant is 

98
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,900
potentially every infant.
And so that's how you should act about 

99
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,450
them.
And you know,

100
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:36,150
one of the things that really is 
interesting about having little kids,

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,600
and I loved having little kids,
is that you have this opportunity to 

102
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,640
have this pristine relationship with 
someone like,

103
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,890
like a relationship you've never had 
with anyone because the kid really is 

104
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:48,920
just there to love you.

105
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,400
You like,
if you don't screw it up,

106
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:53,550
you've got that.
And then you can keep that going.

107
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,610
You know?
And you can try to keep that 

108
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:58,740
relationship like pristine.
And that's so fun.

109
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,600
It's so fun to try to do that.
It's,

110
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,110
it's really,
it's amazing.

111
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:08,070
It's an amazing thing and you know,
kids get a bad rap in our society,

112
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:13,071
but it's an amazing thing to helped 
little kids and they are remarkable and 

113
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:18,240
they give you back far more than they 
require from you and partly because they

114
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:23,241
treat you like you're,
you're valuable beyond belief.

115
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,680
That's what the kid thinks about you.
It's like,

116
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,310
that's pretty good.
So yeah,

117
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:32,190
it's something divine is going to happen
and so okay,

118
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:33,090
fine,
you know,

119
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,480
fair enough.
Well,

120
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:41,481
there's The star signifying that and,
and that's associated in some way with 

121
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:42,660
this star that you're supposed to wish 
upon.

122
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,920
Well,
that's kind of odd.

123
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:48,921
Like there's this,
there's this relationship that's 

124
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:51,501
implicit,
that star that signifies the birth of 

125
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:51,501
the hero is the same star that you wish 
upon.

126
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,060
Well

127
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,980
perhaps the star that you're wishing 
upon is the wish that the hero will be 

128
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,320
born in your soul.
It's something like that.

129
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,770
You're aiming at the ideal,
right?

130
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:04,370
It's the ideal you,
whatever that would be.

131
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Well,
you can certainly figure out what it 

132
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,761
isn't.
That's where you start as far as I can 

133
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:12,761
tell,
you know,

134
00:06:12,761 --> 00:06:16,481
you know,
what you shouldn't be doing and you 

135
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:17,090
could at least stop doing those things 
and then see what happens,

136
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,650
you know,
and if you ask yourself,

137
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:20,150
it's a meditative exercise,
you know,

138
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,670
and you do this with the autobiography 
to some degree.

139
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:23,720
It's like,
okay,

140
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:27,260
sit down for 10 minutes and have a 
little dialogue with yourself.

141
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,150
Like you actually wanted to know the 
answer,

142
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,950
you know?
So yeah,

143
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:33,440
ask,
well I'm probably doing something stupid

144
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,390
that if I quit doing my life would be 
better,

145
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,060
that I could quit doing that I would 
quit doing.

146
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,420
And maybe it's not a very big thing 
because you're not very disciplined,

147
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:45,110
but maybe there's something to ask 
yourself that question,

148
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:50,111
man,
you'll have an answer and no time flat 

149
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,111
like,
well,

150
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,111
I should start doing this.
It's like,

151
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,740
yeah,
I know I could.

152
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:51,830
I didn't,
you know,

153
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,790
I won't,
but.

154
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,160
Or maybe I would,
but if I did,

155
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,640
I know my life would be better.
It's like you can figure that out 

156
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,430
immediately and if you do that 100 
times,

157
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,750
well you'll be in way better shape.
So if you don't know what to do,

158
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:10,751
that's good.
You could at least figure out what you 

159
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:10,751
shouldn't do that's just moronically you
know,

160
00:07:10,751 --> 00:07:15,251
pathetic.
And you can be sure you're doing like a 

161
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:15,251
dozen of those things.
At least you know,

162
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:19,280
procrastinating or you know,
you know everyone.

163
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,540
That's what the conscience tells you and
if you ask,

164
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,350
they'll just tell you why you're stupid 
and insufficient.

165
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,110
And so who wants to hear that?
But what,

166
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,500
maybe you could do something about it.

167
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,140
Okay.
So the cricut comes into the village 

168
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,031
there and he sees this,
this like little house and there's a 

169
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,240
little fire in it.
And so it's Kinda got a welcoming place.

170
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:42,760
It's a light in the darkness.
This house just like the star.

171
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:46,270
And so he hops towards it and then he 
ends up inside it and you know,

172
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:49,870
there's a nice fire and you get to see 
the inside and the insights.

173
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,860
It's cozy,
you know,

174
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,930
it's welcoming.
And then when you look around,

175
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,240
you see that everything's kind of in its
place.

176
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,640
It's not hyper organized or anything 
like that.

177
00:07:57,641 --> 00:08:01,120
It's friendly and welcoming and it's,
there's a lot of wood and there's a nice

178
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:04,810
fire and then there's toys everywhere 
and they're well constructed.

179
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,060
So you know that whoever lives there 
likes children.

180
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,110
And so if someone likes children,
well,

181
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,120
if someone doesn't like children,
it's like you should run away from them 

182
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,120
very rapidly.

183
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,610
But if they liked children,
well then that's a good sign that you 

184
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:17,610
know Jesus there,
at least human.

185
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,520
It's a start,
you know?

186
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:22,870
And then these things are all high 
quality.

187
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:25,180
They're made very well.
And then there's,

188
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,260
and he's looking around to see all of 
this and there's,

189
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,710
there's toys and there's clocks and 
they're all handmade.

190
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,400
And so he sort of infers that maybe 
there's a woodcarver,

191
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,390
who,
who lives there and a woodcarver.

192
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,420
Someone who,
who can build things.

193
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:40,270
And if you build things that work and 
that are beautiful,

194
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,620
that's,
that's a kind of truth,

195
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:46,621
right?
It's like it's built right into the 

196
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:46,621
object.
That's what quality is.

197
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:46,990
Quality is the,
the,

198
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,920
the building into an object of truth.
The thing works.

199
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:55,921
It does what it's supposed to.
It has integrity and so you see that 

200
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,200
everywhere inherent,
so you're getting a sense of the,

201
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,670
the,
the,

202
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,190
the film makers are setting the stage 
and so while,

203
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:06,191
so they set the stage by showing you the
stage and the cricket tells you what he 

204
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:06,750
sees and he's pretty happy to be there 
because.

205
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,690
And this is also someone who's concerned
about time,

206
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,490
right?
Because there was a lot of clocks,

207
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:15,300
there's a lot of clocks and so time 
turns out to be an important sub element

208
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:20,301
of this story and then he sees the 
puppet marionette and so what's a marion

209
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:21,930
out?
Well,

210
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:23,940
a Marionette,
and then he'd be sitting on the shelf.

211
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,680
A marionette is something that's quite 
animated because it can move.

212
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,040
It doesn't really have a soul,
but it sort of acts like it has a soul.

213
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,050
It in,
in,

214
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,960
in,
in the sense of anima and soul.

215
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:39,961
It animated and.
But a Marionette is something that is 

216
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,430
being manipulated by something else 
behind the scenes,

217
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,470
right?
It doesn't have its own volition.

218
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,130
It's dependent on the will have 
something behind the scenes and so 

219
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,601
there's a strong implication that 
whatever this thing is is half formed 

220
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,850
and that it's being manipulated by 
unseen forces behind unseen forces 

221
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,270
behind the facade.

222
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,980
Well,
that's a freudian idea.

223
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,660
That's you.
That's all of you.

224
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:11,661
You know,
you're polled hither and fro by 

225
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:15,320
unconscious forces and some of those are
biological and some of them are 

226
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,320
cultural,
you know,

227
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,761
and you think about people who are swept
up in great ideological movements like 

228
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:22,890
the Communists or the fascist is like 
those people are marrying nets.

229
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,280
That's exactly what they are.
They all say the same thing.

230
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:31,281
They almost the same words.
They all act the same way and some 

231
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:32,940
things behind it.
And the question is what?

232
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Well,
that is the question and that's partly 

233
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,520
what this movie tries to figure out.
So you see this Marionette,

234
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,550
he's at half formed,
wouldn't headed puppet and he has a 

235
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,460
little bit of potential,
you know,

236
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:48,000
and the cricket goes up and interacts 
with them and sees that he's made out of

237
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:53,001
pretty good wood.
It makes a little joke about having a 

238
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:53,370
wooden head and you know,
that's kind of obvious what that means.

239
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,370
And you noticed the cricket is dressed 
like a tramp and,

240
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,490
and when you first saw him he wasn't,
he was dressed like a 19 twenties 

241
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:03,490
millionaire.
So,

242
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,180
but no,
but here he's a tramp and this is so 

243
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,180
interesting.
It's like,

244
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,030
so this bug,
that's a messiah,

245
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,330
that's the introduction to the book.
That's the conscience is also a tramp 

246
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,290
with no home.
It's like what does that mean?

247
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,240
And it took me a long time to sort that 
out and it's like he's been everywhere.

248
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,020
This tramp,
he's been everywhere and,

249
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,180
and he knows he's,
he's traveled the world and anybody who 

250
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
doesn't have a place,
he doesn't have a home.

251
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,450
He hasn't made a relationship with 
anything real yet.

252
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:35,220
He's,
he's kind of a potential.

253
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,520
And this is one of the things that's 
really interesting about this movie 

254
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,071
because if you think about the cricket 
as a fragment of the of the hero and say

255
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:46,350
a,
a reflection of the of the savior,

256
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:49,140
which is his relationship with jc of 
course,

257
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:54,141
and the person who introduces the book,
then the story gets strange because if 

258
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,880
it was merely a representation of the 
perfect person,

259
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:02,881
the archetype of the hero,
then the conscience would know 

260
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:02,881
everything,
right?

261
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:05,770
And it would just tell the puppet what 
to do and that would be the end of it.

262
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,150
But that,
first of all,

263
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:12,151
that's adult story.
It's like perfect conscience comes 

264
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:12,151
along.
Puppet does everything.

265
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:15,730
It says being goal perfection,
but that isn't what happens.

266
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:20,731
There's this weird idea that this thing 
that's got all these attributes needs a 

267
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:25,141
home and has to enter into a learning 
relationship with the thing that it's 

268
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:29,890
trying to transform.
It's so sophisticated because you know,

269
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:32,500
I could say you should do what your 
conscience tells you.

270
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,000
It's like,
well,

271
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,700
maybe not.
Maybe that's not exactly how it works.

272
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,910
Maybe your conscience isn't omniscient 
and omnipotent.

273
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,090
Maybe it's not gone right.
It's a guide,

274
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,990
but it's,
it's,

275
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,020
it's,
it's maybe smarter than you sometimes 

276
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,840
maybe because it's society in your head 
and obviously it's smarter than you 

277
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,801
sometimes because it tells you not to do
something and you go do it and then you 

278
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:55,930
get into trouble and you think,
well,

279
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:58,090
if I would've just listened,
but you don't,

280
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:59,200
and that's interesting too.

281
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,810
It's something that you don't have to 
listen to,

282
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,630
which is seems to be associated with 
freewill.

283
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,660
It's weird.
It's like if your conscience knows what 

284
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,850
to do,
why aren't you just a deterministic 

285
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,120
puppet of your conscience Christ?
That would work a lot better.

286
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,880
You wouldn't have to torture yourself 
and you wouldn't make any mistakes.

287
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:18,670
So why the separation?
Well,

288
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:23,671
maybe it's because of the conscience is 
generic and so it has to be taught.

289
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,850
It has to learn to,
and so what you do is you have a 

290
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,921
dialogue with your conscience.
It's something like that and then you 

291
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:34,891
expose yourself to more and more of the 
world and you get wiser in your 

292
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:38,851
conscience gets wiser and new.
You mature together and that's what 

293
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:43,351
happens in this story because the 
cricket starts out as a tramp that you 

294
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:47,611
know,
is smarter than the puppet but not as 

295
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:47,611
smart as he thinks he is.

296
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:49,390
That's for sure.
And when he first starts to operate as a

297
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:51,160
conscience,
he's completely useless.

298
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:56,161
Added.
He babbles off a lot of cliches about 

299
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:58,591
morality and then he's late the first 
day for his job and he's just not very 

300
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:02,881
good at it.
And so there's this weird idea that the 

301
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:05,461
conscience,
which is part of what puts you towards 

302
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:08,311
redemption is something that you 
actually have to interact with over the 

303
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:10,570
course of your life in order for it to 
develop as you develop.

304
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,050
And so then I would also say that the 
cricket represents,

305
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:16,450
at least in part what you described as 
the self,

306
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:21,451
which is like the potential fully 
developed human being that sort of 

307
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:23,980
exists within you as a possibility,
but it has to be.

308
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,430
It has to be manifest in the actual 
conditions of your life.

309
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,560
And so the conscience has to learn how 
to position itself here and now and it's

310
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,170
got generic advice and that's not good 
enough.

311
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,510
And so that's why the cricket is looking
for a home.

312
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,630
And so he needs a home even though he's 
all these other things we already said 

313
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,830
he was,
he has to find a specific home before he

314
00:14:44,831 --> 00:14:48,790
can become who he could be.
Well,

315
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,640
so then Japan,
oh,

316
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,660
shows up and he's a kindly old guy,
which is pretty much exactly what you'd 

317
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:54,660
expect.
And you know,

318
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,931
he,
he's a careful craftsman and he likes 

319
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:58,931
kittens and you know,
that's always a good thing.

320
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,250
And he has some fish and I know he's.
And He's good at making things and he's 

321
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,460
got a sense of humor and he's kind of 
playful.

322
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,280
And so he's,
he's a,

323
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,220
he's a good father.
Fundamentally.

324
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,370
He's the wise king.
He's the positive archetype of the 

325
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:15,370
masculine.
That's what he is.

326
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,960
And so he's culture and its positive 
manifestation.

327
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:21,590
And he gives rise to this creation,
which is his puppet,

328
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,590
which is what culture does because 
you're a puppet of your culture,

329
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:29,591
you're a Marionette of your culture.
And so maybe you could be more than 

330
00:15:29,591 --> 00:15:33,341
that,
and that's the other thing that's 

331
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:36,681
strange about this movie,
and it's strange about the mythological 

332
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,640
way of looking at the world because 
scientifically deterministically,

333
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,340
there's nature and there's culture and 
you are the deterministic product of the

334
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:47,940
interaction between nature and culture.
There's nothing else to you than that.

335
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:53,270
That's that.
But the mythological world doesn't say 

336
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:53,270
that.
It says something different.

337
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,280
It says that there's nature and culture,
and then there's you and the you that's 

338
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:04,041
in there has choices and the destiny and
that you actually affect the interplay 

339
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:07,380
of nature and culture in determining 
your own character.

340
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,500
And it insists upon that.
The oldest stories we have,

341
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,660
there's always the hero and the 
archetypal mother and the archetype.

342
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,680
Father.
There's always those three things.

343
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:20,760
There's never just two.
So from a narrative perspective,

344
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,330
there's always the implication that 
there is something autonomous about the,

345
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,330
the hero of the story.
