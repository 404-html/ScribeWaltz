1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,380
Breast is this positive study?
No,

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,020
it's maps of meaning positive psych.
It's definitely not that.

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,930
Why might you be villainous?

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,580
Well,
first of all,

5
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:31,670
because you can be.
That's a big deal.

6
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,120
You can be.
It's actually an offshoot of empathy.

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,960
This is something that took me decades 
to figure out.

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,470
I figured it out when I was studying the
book of Genesis because in the book of 

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,761
Genesis,
people become self conscious and they 

10
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:48,761
immediately have the knowledge of good 
and evil.

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,960
I just couldn't figure it out.
It's like,

12
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:55,961
what?
What the hell is the relationship 

13
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:55,961
between that?
And then really I tell you,

14
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:59,741
I thought about that like for 30 years 
trying to puzzle that out and then I 

15
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:03,200
realized what it was.
If you're self conscious,

16
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,710
you can,
you can conceptualize yourself as being 

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,910
you know that you are and you know what 
you're like and you know what hurts you 

18
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:18,280
and what doesn't,
and as soon as you know what hurts you,

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,900
you know what hurts her,

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,340
and so that's the knowledge of good and 
evil that comes along with being self 

21
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,431
conscious as this is something that 
distinguishes human beings from every 

22
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:31,130
other animal.
You know a lion will eat you,

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,610
but it doesn't really want to tear you 
apart slowly,

24
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,950
just for the fun of it.
Well,

25
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:39,190
it eats you.
It just wants to eat you and you,

26
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:41,270
you know,
you could call that evil it socks,

27
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:46,271
that's for sure,
but animals are beyond good and evil in 

28
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:46,490
that sense,
but human beings,

29
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:51,491
man,
we can aim our malevolence and we're 

30
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:51,491
really good at it because we can imagine
God,

31
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,060
this would hurt and if it hurts me,
man,

32
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:55,520
it's really going to hurt you.
So.

33
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:58,250
And you need to know that you're like 
that because you are like that.

34
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,730
And if you don't know you're like that,
or if you don't think you're like that,

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,880
you're even more like that than you 
think because the people who are most 

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,790
like that or people who don't think 
they're like that at all and you have to

37
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:15,791
contend with that and that's why in many
systems of thinking the world is 

38
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:20,891
conceptualized as a battle between good 
and evil and it's inappropriate 

39
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,740
conceptualization.
It's a medic conceptualization and

40
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,380
the culture is the wise king in the 
tyrant and that's always the case and 

41
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,990
you're always stuck with that because as
an individual with your negative side 

42
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,480
and your positive side year,
negative side is the resentful side that

43
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,720
is irritated that the limited conditions
of being and the suffering that entails 

44
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:47,821
and it's arbitrary and unfair nature and
no wonder you got that side has a case 

45
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:54,121
to make.
It's not trivial in in the brothers 

46
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:57,190
Karamazov,
that argument is laid out beautifully.

47
00:02:57,191 --> 00:03:00,040
There's a character Alioscha who's a 
monk,

48
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,550
monastery novitiate,
and not really a sparkling intellect,

49
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:08,551
but a very good person and he has a 
brother Ivan and Ivan's a vicious genius

50
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,170
and Ivan just take silly Osha apart and 
partly he does that by telling a story 

51
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,240
about that.
Dostoevsky took this from a news story.

52
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,570
The news story was that this mother and 
father had taken their young daughter 

53
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,430
and locked her in the outhouse overnight
when it was like 30 below and you know,

54
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,450
she stayed out there crying and 
screaming and froze to death and I even 

55
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,350
basically said to Lee Osha,
you know,

56
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,520
a world in which that could happen 
should not be.

57
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,020
That's good argument.
You know when you can multiply that by 

58
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,020
millions of examples.

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,800
So the part of us that is opposed to 
being and resentful,

60
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,290
it's got a point,
man.

61
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,840
The problem as far as I can tell is that
if you act that out,

62
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,140
then it makes what you're objecting to 
worse.

63
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,220
Now you might be happy about that and 
you might think,

64
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:18,221
well,
people couldn't be consciously pursuing 

65
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:18,221
that,
but yes they can.

66
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,280
I would recommend a book called Pans,
Ram if you're interested in that sort of

67
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:27,281
thing.
It's a book written by a man who raped 

68
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,771
1200 men and killed dozens and burn 
things down to the ground every chance 

69
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:35,081
he got and tried to start a war between 
England and the US and who is aimed at 

70
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:39,131
nothing but mayhem and he wrote an 
autobiography at the request of a doctor

71
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:44,471
who had befriended him and he tells you 
exactly what he did and why the story,

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,040
heroin adversary,
adversary order and tyranny,

73
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,860
destruction and creation.
That's the basic landscape and outside 

74
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:08,160
of that chaos.
And so let's take a break.

75
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,390
Here's another way of looking at this 
idea.

76
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,230
The individual is the person who pays 
attention and explores and masters or 

77
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:27,510
who looks away

78
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:30,900
and the

79
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,170
the person is still inhabits unexplored 
territory and this is unexplored 

80
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:42,110
territory,
and so wherever you go,

81
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:45,260
there's you have two halves of you

82
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,210
that you have to contend with and

83
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:54,510
wherever you are with people,
there's the society with its tyrannical 

84
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:59,701
and beneficial nature and this society 
in some sense is that match between what

85
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:05,531
you're doing and what's happening.
It's really important to get that right 

86
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,760
and then unexplored territory that's 
wherever and whenever.

87
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,420
What you're doing stops working and so 
it's not exactly a geographical idea,

88
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:19,901
you know,
because when you think of explored 

89
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,281
territory,
you think of geographic landscape like 

90
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:21,281
that,
like the domain of an animal,

91
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,240
you know,
or like your house and you know that's,

92
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,290
that's definitely an element of it,
but you know,

93
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,830
if you're in your house and a snake 
comes into your living room and you're 

94
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,830
in there,
it's like,

95
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,600
well that's an important difference 
between your house.

96
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:42,470
One second to go in your house now and 
so your house can turn into unexplored,

97
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,110
unexplored territory at the drop of a 
hat.

98
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,110
And that's because we live in space and 
time and so the unexplored territory is 

99
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,000
conceptual.
It's a conceptual territory and it's 

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,270
just wherever you are,
when things aren't working for you the 

101
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:02,150
way they're supposed to be.
And so,

102
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,140
and these are permanent parts of the 
human experience,

103
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,470
which is why I think they are 
fundamental characters in our 

104
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:11,470
narratives.
There's always you.

105
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,550
There's some subject of the story and 
that subject is an ambivalent person 

106
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,771
with many different potentials and 
you're always somewhere and with other 

107
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:21,680
people because that's our territory,
right?

108
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:25,370
I mean we're social beyond comprehension
and you know,

109
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:30,371
even our primate ancestors,
most of their territory was other 

110
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:34,451
primates and their brains and our brains
are specialized to view the world as an 

111
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,300
aggregation of personalities.
It's really important to us and so we 

112
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,870
tend to view the whole world that way.
And then unexplored territory.

113
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,870
Well,
that's where you don't know what to do 

114
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,940
and but you know,
you do know what to do when you don't 

115
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,390
know what to do peculiarly enough.
It's rather nonspecific.

116
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,460
It's this generalized stress response 
and so what happens is you freeze,

117
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,530
roughly speaking,
if the threat is enough,

118
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,830
then you produce a lot of cortisol and a
lot of adrenaline so that you're bloody 

119
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,960
well ready to move quick and whatever 
direction you have to,

120
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,200
and then maybe you pay more attention 
and that's what you do when you don't 

121
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,491
know what to do.
And the problem with that is as you can 

122
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:21,491
stay in that state forever,
man,

123
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,240
that's kind of what posttraumatic stress
disorder is.

124
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,610
It's like you're just like that all the 
time.

125
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,150
And the problem with that is it's a very
uncomfortable.

126
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:34,151
I mean,
you stay like that for any length of 

127
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:34,151
time.
You're going to get depressed,

128
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:34,151
you're going to develop an anxiety 
disorder,

129
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:38,960
you're going to get old because you're 
burning up resources like mad.

130
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,960
You know,
your system is shunting everything to 

131
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,380
maintain that state of emergency 
preparation.

132
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:49,490
And it's exhausting.
It's not where you want to be.

133
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,360
So that's partly why people are so prone
to defend their territories.

134
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,790
They're familiar territory because if 
they're familiar territory is invaded or

135
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:04,791
disrupted,
then they default back to the state of 

136
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,070
emergency preparation.
And that's like,

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,360
that can unglue you if it's.
If it's profound enough.

138
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,160
You know,
and you guys know this already.

139
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:13,470
I mean,
I think people experience this most,

140
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:18,471
particularly when they're betrayed by 
someone they have an intimate 

141
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:18,730
relationship with.
You know,

142
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,210
when they're lied to.
There's other ways.

143
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,630
The collapse of a dream or a vision that
you've been pursuing or an illness or 

144
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,951
the death in the family.
There's lots of other ways but be is a 

145
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:32,520
really good one because if you're with 
someone for a long time,

146
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:33,300
you trust them.

147
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,510
You have a representation of your past,
you have a representation of you in the 

148
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,810
relationship,
you have a representation of them.

149
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,150
You have a representation of of 
relationships.

150
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,510
You have a representation of the future.
You get betrayed.

151
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:50,511
It's like poof.
Even the past isn't what you thought it 

152
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:50,511
was.
You know,

153
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:52,080
and what about you?
You know,

154
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,850
how clueless are you and maybe not at 
all or maybe ultimately gullible.

155
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:59,830
You don't know.
Is it your fault or you know,

156
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,840
or you so clueless that you just can't 
protect yourself or was the person 

157
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,391
malevolent in some subtle way that you 
failed to detect everything's up in the 

158
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:12,660
air,
not good and this idea that human beings

159
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,330
traveled to the underworld and come 
back.

160
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,360
It's like it's a really useful thing to 
understand because we do that all the 

161
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,390
time.
Whenever we fail,

162
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:26,391
it's like whip down into the underworld 
for awhile where everything's in chaos 

163
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,530
and then maybe we sort ourselves out.
Bang,

164
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:33,531
we're back up and so one way of 
conceptualizing yourself is not as order

165
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,710
and as not as chaos,
but as the thing that traverses between 

166
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,440
the two domains and that I would say is 
the mythological hero.
