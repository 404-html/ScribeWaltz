1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,010
Okay,
what time is it?

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,160
I started when 6:30.
I shouldn't stop them.

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,300
Thank you.

4
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,930
I'm going to go for five more minutes 
and then I'll wrap this up.

5
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:38,860
I want to talk about intersectionality 
and,

6
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,870
and white privilege a bit.

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,030
So.

8
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,580
So I first said,
well,

9
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,760
we analyzed Marxism,
we analyzed postmodernism.

10
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,530
I suggested that postmodernism was a way
for the Marxist to keep going under a 

11
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,791
new guys.
I suggested that Marxism was 

12
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,750
fundamentally based on hatred rather 
than sympathy and empathy.

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,130
I suggested that the corpses were the,
the evidence for that.

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,180
Um,
I told you why I think postmodernism is 

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,180
fundamentally wrong.

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,220
Um,

17
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,290
now I want to talk to you a little bit 
about white privilege.

18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,090
So the first thing that I,
and I haven't got this quite figured out

19
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:32,091
yet,
I can't quite figure out why the 

20
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:32,670
postmodernists have made the canonical 
distinctions.

21
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:35,550
They've made race,
ethnicity,

22
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,850
sexual proclivity,
sexual,

23
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,910
gender identity.
Let's say those are four dimensions 

24
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,511
along which people vary,
but there's a very large number of 

25
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:47,670
dimensions along which people vary,
right?

26
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:51,360
In fact,
given that there's an infinite number of

27
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:56,361
ways of interpreting the world,
you can immediately point out that 

28
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:57,690
there's an infinite number of dimensions
along which people vary,

29
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,990
and so then the postmodern question is,
why would you privilege some of those 

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,420
dimensions over the other?
And I would say,

31
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:08,421
well,
because it sustains your bloody Marxist 

32
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:08,421
interpretation.
That's why,

33
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:09,240
but you're not going to say that because
it marginalizes,

34
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,450
right?
You've marginalized that so you can 

35
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,371
ignore it.
So that's one of the fun things about 

36
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:16,371
postmodernism.
You can.

37
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:20,190
You can.
I have a very vulgar image in my mind,

38
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,230
but I won't share that with you,
but you can infer it.

39
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,460
Here's some ways people differ.
Intelligence,

40
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:30,900
temperament,
geography,

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,050
historical time.
You live now in not 100 years ago.

42
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,610
Attractiveness.
That's a big.

43
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,890
That's a big one.
That's a big one.

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,140
Would you imagine?
You could.

45
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,020
We won't.

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
We won't go there.
Either.

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,200
You eat.
It's advantageous to be young.

48
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,460
You've got potential disadvantageous to 
be old.

49
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,710
You've got wealth health.
That's a good one.

50
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,520
Sex women have advantages.
Men have advantages.

51
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,010
Maybe one has more than the other.
It's not self evident.

52
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,870
Women live about eight years longer 
there.

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,040
Athleticism,
well,

54
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,510
family structure,
friendship,

55
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,090
education,
well then there's the classic,

56
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,630
you know,
postmodern once,

57
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:15,590
race,
ethnicity,

58
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,650
etc.
Why not those other dimensions of 

59
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,671
variation.
There's no evidence that they're less 

60
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:24,671
important.
In fact,

61
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,490
there's quite a bit of evidence that 
they're more important,

62
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,150
so like Why not consider them?
Then you get intersectionality.

63
00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:34,151
This is one of the things that's really 
comical I think because the 

64
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,300
postmodernists identity politics types 
actually realized this.

65
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:36,230
They thought,
well,

66
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:37,370
okay,
race and gender.

67
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,170
Fair enough.

68
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,820
What if you're.
What if you're a black woman?

69
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,830
Well,
that's a problem because,

70
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,820
well now you've got two dimensions of 
differentiation.

71
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:49,020
What the hell are we going to do about 
that?

72
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,810
And what if you're,
what if you're gay and black and female?

73
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,740
Well then what if you're not very bright
and gay and black and female,

74
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,040
and then what if you're ugly and not 
very bright and gay and black and 

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,010
female,
and like you can keep playing that game.

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,520
You can keep playing that game and an 
infinite number of ways because there's 

77
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,010
an infinite number of ways to categorize
things.

78
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:13,011
As The postmodern authority pointed out,
and so the intersectionality theorist 

79
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:14,310
came along to plug the hole,
but they don't know where they're going.

80
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,520
They don't understand that the logical 
conclusion of intersectionality is 

81
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,331
individuality because there's so many 
different ways of categorizing people's 

82
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,690
advantages and disadvantages that if you
take that all the way out to the end,

83
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:28,140
you say,
well,

84
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:29,910
the individuals,
the ultimate minority,

85
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,510
and that's exactly right and that's 
exactly what the west discovered and you

86
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:36,290
know the intersection lists,
so get there if they don't kill everyone

87
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,300
first,
so onto white privilege.

88
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,540
So it's really interesting to find out 
where these ideas come from because it's

89
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:54,230
usually the scholarship is so awful,
you just cannot possibly believe it.

90
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:57,110
It's just absolutely.
It wouldn't.

91
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,810
In at the university of toronto,
in the psychology department,

92
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,140
the original paper on white privilege 
wouldn't have received a passing grade 

93
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,440
for the hypothesis part of a 
undergraduate honors thesis.

94
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,470
We're not even close.
There's no methodology at all.

95
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,620
The person who wrote It,
it was called white privilege and male 

96
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,401
privilege.
A personal account of coming to see 

97
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:23,570
correspondences through work in women's 
studies.

98
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,130
Well,
first of all,

99
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:26,420
personal account,
it's like,

100
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:27,380
sorry.
No,

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,290
I'm

102
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,450
so she,
she listed a bunch of ways that she 

103
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,121
thought she says these are personal 
personal examples of her unearned 

104
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:43,781
privilege or unearned privilege that she
saw as she experienced in the 19 

105
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:43,790
seventies,
19 eighties.

106
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,970
So this part of the way.
So this idea is the opinion of one 

107
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,971
person who wrote one paper that has 
absolutely no empirical backing 

108
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:56,381
whatsoever,
which is a set of hypotheses which had 

109
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:59,711
never been subject to any statistical.
Like if I ask you a bunch of questions,

110
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,840
it's not obvious how many questions I'm 
asking you because I could say,

111
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,210
how tall are you?
Or I could say,

112
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:08,090
if you're laying on the ground,
how extended would you be?

113
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,470
Like that?
Two questions.

114
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,220
It's like,
no,

115
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,940
it's one question.
It's just asked two ways and the way you

116
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,980
figure out if you ask someone a bunch of
questions,

117
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,981
how many questions you're asking them is
by doing something called a factor 

118
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,161
analysis,
which is kind of in an elementary form 

119
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:24,890
now of social science investigation.

120
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,890
If you make a questionnaire,
you have to subject it to a factor 

121
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,080
analysis because you've got to find out 
how many questions you're asking because

122
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,600
you might think it's 60,
but it's probably not.

123
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,790
It's probably five.
That's the big five,

124
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,200
by the way.
Anyways.

125
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,350
Who cares about that?
There's no such thing as methodology.

126
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:44,351
Anyways,
that's all part of the oppressive white 

127
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:47,291
male european patriarchy,
so we can just not bother with that and 

128
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:51,521
we can pin a few notes about how we 
think the world is constructed and then 

129
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:54,680
we can screw up the entire political 
system two decades later.

130
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,340
Okay,
so here's your white privilege lists.

131
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:03,341
Some of it.
There's like 50 things I can if I wish 

132
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:03,341
arrange to be in the company of people 
of my race,

133
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,660
most of the time,
if I should need to move,

134
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:10,661
I can be pretty sure of renting or 
purchasing housing in an area which I 

135
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:10,850
can afford and in which I would want to 
live.

136
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,160
That's actually a wealth thing.
By the way.

137
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,370
I can be pretty sure that my neighbors 
in such a location will be neutral or 

138
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,521
pleasant to me.
I can go shopping alone most of the 

139
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:24,101
time,
pretty well assured that I will not be 

140
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:25,781
followed or harassed.
I can turn on the television or open to 

141
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:28,841
the front page of the paper and see 
people of my waist race widely 

142
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:32,510
represented when I'm told about our 
national heritage or about civilization,

143
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,900
I am shown that people of my color made 
it what it is.

144
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,110
There's 50 of those I think something 
like that.

145
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,840
Okay.
Is that white privilege?

146
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:44,550
Is that like majority privilege?

147
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,270
It's the same tree.
You go to China,

148
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:48,440
you're chinese.
Is the same?

149
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:49,550
True.
If you're chinese,

150
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,690
does the majority privilege benefits?
Majority privileges.

151
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,070
Like isn't that just part of living 
within your culture?

152
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,340
So let's say you live in your culture,
you're privileged as a member of that 

153
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,361
culture,
while obviously that's what the culture 

154
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:07,361
is for.
That's what it's for.

155
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,550
Why would you bother building the damn 
thing if it didn't accrue benefits to 

156
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,550
you?
Now you mighT say,

157
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,781
well,
one of the consequences that it accrues 

158
00:08:16,781 --> 00:08:16,910
fewer benefits to those who aren't in 
the culture.

159
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,300
yeah,
but you can immediately associate that 

160
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,300
with race.
You can't just do that.

161
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,070
Say it's white,
privileged does many things it could be 

162
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,240
certainly could be well and the 
intersectional people have already 

163
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,360
figured out that there's many things 
that could be so like what the hell?

164
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,450
Seriously,
well what's going on while we let these 

165
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,361
pseudo disciplines into the university 
because we're stupid and guilty 

166
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:44,500
seriously and they have no 
methodological requirements and plenty 

167
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,301
of power and plenty of time to produce 
nonsensical research and produce like 

168
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:52,640
resentful activists and now we're 
bearing the fruits of that.

169
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,520
IT's not pretty so privilege.
Well,

170
00:08:56,521 --> 00:09:01,521
the other thing you might notice is that
to attribute to the individuals of a 

171
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:07,071
community,
the attributes of that community on the 

172
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,970
basis of their racial identity is called
racism.

173
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,900
That's what racism is.
There's no other way of defining it.

174
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,290
It's attributing to the individual the 
characteristics of the group as if the 

175
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,091
group was homogenous.
Now the intersection of people have 

176
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:26,421
already decided that's not a fair game 
because there's so many differences 

177
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:29,931
between people,
but the postmodernist don't care about 

178
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:30,990
logical coherence because they regard 
logical coherence.

179
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Here it comes again as a creation of the
white european male patrIarchal 

180
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,850
structure that's designed to oppress the
oppressed,

181
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,910
and that's technically the case.
So logical,

182
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:43,590
incoherence,
it doesn't matter,

183
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:44,760
and you could say,
well,

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,760
if you act out your logically incoherent
ideas in the world,

185
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:50,460
you're going to run face first into a 
brick wall,

186
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,420
and the postmodern answer to that is 
there's actually no real world.

187
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,240
It's all interpretation.
So there's no,

188
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:02,270
there's no having that discussion,
but the modernists don't care because 

189
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,290
they don't believe that discussion 
between people of different power groups

190
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,490
as possible.
Anyways.

191
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,340
So here we are.
Well,

192
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,350
so I made a case tonight,
you know,

193
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,910
I'll go over it.
What's the case?

194
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,960
The postmodernists are wrong.
They're philosophically naive,

195
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,280
they're right about an infinite number 
of interpretations and wrong about a 

196
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,750
finite number of viable interpretations 
and that's like that's,

197
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,020
that's death.
That's the end of postmodernists theory 

198
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,020
and that's not the only way in which 
they're wrong.

199
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,430
They're wrong and a bunch of other ways,
but they're more subsidiary.

200
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,930
The marxists.

201
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,850
They're not just wrong.
They're wrong and murderous or wrong,

202
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,330
murderous and genocidal.
Unless you think murderers and genocidal

203
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,570
doesn't mean wrong,
and you can think that there's lots of 

204
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,021
would be revolutionaries who would be 
happy to have blood running in the 

205
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:59,171
street if they had their chance for 
revenge and the opportunity to move up 

206
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:03,371
the hierarchy of charity so you can.
You don't have to think that murder and 

207
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:07,811
genocide is wrong,
especially if the right people are 

208
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:07,811
murdered in genocided.
Right?

209
00:11:07,811 --> 00:11:09,770
That's actually part of the part of the 
whole equation.

210
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,040
But if you're willing to think that 
murder and genocide on a mass scale 

211
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,060
across many cultures,
over many decades is wrong.

212
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Then marxism is wrong and the 
postmodernist don't get to just come 

213
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:27,461
along and adopt marxism as a matter of 
sleight of hand because they're marx's 

214
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,020
theory didn't work out and they figured 
out a rationalization.

215
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,050
They don't get to get away with that 
because it's too dangerous.

216
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:38,051
IT's too dangerous to the rest of us and
we don't and it isn't necessary for us 

217
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,940
who are trying with the small part of 
our hearts that might be oriented 

218
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,541
towards the good to allow people who are
manipulating us with historical 

219
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:56,641
ignorance and philosophical of hand to 
render a so god damn guilty about what 

220
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:01,060
our ancestors may or may not have done 
so that we allow our shame and our guilt

221
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:06,061
to be.
To be used as tools to manipulate us 

222
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:07,690
into accepting a future that we do not 
want to have.

223
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,980
And that's that.

224
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,170
Thank you.
