1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,190
You know,
people often say to their kids,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,430
it doesn't matter whether you win or 
lose,

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:10,431
it's how you play the game.
And the kid who of course has no idea 

4
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:10,431
what that means.
It's like,

5
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:11,550
what do you mean?
Now I'm trying to win.

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,110
And the parents says,
no,

7
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:14,670
no,
it matters how you play.

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,850
And the kid pushes them in.
The parents really can't come up with a 

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:19,860
good explanation of why that's the case.
They might say,

10
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:21,570
well,
other kids won't play with you if your.

11
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,310
Oh,
there you go.

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,590
Because you could say this is something 
to think about.

13
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:33,570
So there's a game and there's a victory 
within the game,

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,380
but then there's the set of all games 
and there's victory across the set of 

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,600
old games.
And the victory that you attained across

16
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:45,420
the set of all games isn't winning all 
the games.

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,910
It's being invited to play all the 
games.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,720
And so if you play fair,
then you're playing a metagame and the 

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,640
metagame is how to win across the set of
all games.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,010
And so if you teach your child how to 
behave properly,

21
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:04,011
then they always get invited to play.
And that makes them winners and that's 

22
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:09,441
that.
And so if you understand that you 

23
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:12,081
understand something phenomenally 
important about the emergence of 

24
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:12,810
morality,
you know,

25
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:17,811
because people moral relativists in 
particular think that morality is 

26
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:17,940
relative,
you know,

27
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:20,460
and,
and of course human beings are diverse,

28
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:25,461
just like languages are diverse and 
there's more than one playable game,

29
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,410
but there's not really more than one 
playable Medicaid.

30
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,310
It's like you're either the kind of 
person that other people want to play 

31
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,891
with or you're not.
And if you're not the kind of person 

32
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:37,410
that other people want to play with,
then you're a loser.

33
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,730
It's as simple as that.

34
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,970
And that's true of all cultures.
They might be playing different 

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,170
individual games within their culture.
Undoubtedly they are,

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,560
but the set of all games that they play 
is still common across cultures.

37
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:54,960
That's part of what makes us human.
And then you could say as well,

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,440
we're actually evolved to detect people 
who are good at playing the set of all 

39
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,421
possible games.
And we actually know that that's not 

40
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:05,421
theoretical.
We know,

41
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:09,621
for example,
some things are easy to remember and 

42
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:09,621
some things are hard to remember.
You know,

43
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,490
here's something that's easy to 
remember.

44
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,920
You play with someone in need,
cheat man,

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,740
you will remember that.
That's like in your mind,

46
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:21,741
that's not going anywhere,
and so you're great at detecting 

47
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:25,551
cheaters and you remember,
and that's because you can't trust a 

48
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:29,451
cheater and you shouldn't invite a 
cheater to play a game with you because 

49
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:29,451
they might cheat.

50
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:32,340
And so that's part of the innate 
morality system.

51
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:35,190
You remember cheaters because they 
aren't good at playing the metagame.

52
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,970
And of course your evolved.
Of course you're adapted to the metagame

53
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,410
because you're the product of this 
immense evolutionary history,

54
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:46,020
right?
And whoever your ancestors were,

55
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,500
which is an unbroken string of 
successful reproducers going back three 

56
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,380
and a half billion years,
you think about that.

57
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Every single one of your ancestors 
successfully reproduced it's 

58
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,820
mindboggling.
The chances against that are so.

59
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,040
It's billions,
billions to one.

60
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:08,041
And here you are,
the line of three and a half billion 

61
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:11,581
years of success.
The whole world was trying to kill you 

62
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:12,040
that whole time.
And here you are.

63
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,940
It's like a.
But you know,

64
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,060
you're still only going to last about 80
years.

65
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,950
So.
But that's,

66
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:18,640
you know,
still,

67
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,720
you know,
good for you.

68
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,780
So anyways,
there were lots of games that your 

69
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,800
ancestors were playing across that 
immense span of time.

70
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,090
Many,
many,

71
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,790
you know,
Lizard Games and tree dweller games and,

72
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,720
and,
and what,

73
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:35,830
and,
and Crustacean Games,

74
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:40,831
you know,
that huge set of games and you're 

75
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:42,250
adapted to win across those games.
All of them.

76
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,280
And that's built into you man.
That's,

77
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,380
that's your central human nature.
That's what makes you social.

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,400
And it's not some mere cultural 
construct.

79
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,370
Quite the contrary.
It's,

80
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,410
it's so deeply embedded in you.
It's what you are.

81
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,030
Alright?
So,

82
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,780
well this is a story.
It's a game too.

83
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,490
That's another way of thinking about it.
You know,

84
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,590
like that's a monopoly game.
Well,

85
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,430
what's the frame?
Well that's the rules of the game.

86
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,660
And are they,
why do you accept them or it's kind of 

87
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:14,660
arbitrary,
right?

88
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,290
It's like that happens to be the rules.
Hockey has different rules,

89
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,650
basketball has different rules,
but what they share is that they have 

90
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:22,650
rules.
Okay?

91
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,520
So there's a frame,
that's the rules.

92
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,520
And then within the frame there's a goal
and the goal is whatever the rules 

93
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,770
dictate,
you know,

94
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:34,771
there's usually,
it's usually the construction of a 

95
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:37,021
hierarchy of success within a frame.
And so that's what you play.

96
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,460
So you play monopoly.
It's like,

97
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,160
well we'll accept the rules,
that's the social contract.

98
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:44,410
And then we'll each try to win.
And that'll be fun.

99
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,110
We find that amusing music.
And if you lose,

100
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,480
what do you say while you say,
well,

101
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:52,270
there's always another game.
And so that's great.

102
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:55,180
So if you have that attitude and you 
play fair,

103
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:57,010
then it doesn't matter that much that 
you,

104
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,280
whether you win or lose,
although you still want to try to win 

105
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,280
because otherwise you're not a good 
player,

106
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,510
but you accept defeat gracefully because
you can play again and so and you'll win

107
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:09,040
some and you lose some.
And so that's not so bad,

108
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,460
you know?

109
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,190
And even if you lose,
well maybe you learn something and,

110
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,540
and you're doing a lot more than one 
thing while you're playing monopoly,

111
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:21,541
you know,
you're having a conversation and 

112
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:21,580
learning how to interact with people and
learning how to regulate your emotions.

113
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,980
And so even if you lose,
if you have any sense,

114
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:26,260
you win.
And if your kids have any sense,

115
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,270
they know that.
And so that way you buffer them against 

116
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,270
defeat.
It's like,

117
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,270
yeah,
yeah,

118
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,140
I get on next time.
It's like,

119
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,570
so okay,
then you should try.

120
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,920
But it's okay.
And,

121
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,330
and that's,
that's,

122
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,150
that's useful information for people to 
know.

123
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,120
So.
Alright,

124
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,160
so you're always in one of these little 
frameworks and there's just no getting 

125
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,160
out of it.
So.

126
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,160
And that's because,
you know,

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,320
at any given moment this is like,
it's like field theory.

128
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:58,321
There used to be psychological theories 
that talked about the field of human 

129
00:05:58,321 --> 00:05:58,490
experience,
something like that.

130
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,830
And this is kind of what that is.
This is a field.

131
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:05,720
And basically what happens is you parse 
out a little part of the world say,

132
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,320
and so you can handle.
So let's say it has some duration.

133
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,000
You're not aiming at something 50 years 
in the future.

134
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,740
It's because how the hell are you going 
to do that?

135
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,700
There's too many variables,
you know,

136
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,580
so you're aiming at some handleable 
amount of time and you pause it,

137
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,590
a goal in there.
And you plot your route and then that 

138
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,610
tells you what's up and tells you what's
down.

139
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,650
[inaudible] moves you towards the goal 
and down moves you away from the goal 

140
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,971
and that sets up your motivational 
framework so that you have some worth 

141
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:36,971
attaining.
You know,

142
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,930
that's a really interesting thing to 
know too.

143
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,580
It's like,
why have a goal ball?

144
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,370
It's easy,
no goal,

145
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,520
no positive emotion because you 
experienced positive emotion by noticing

146
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:53,921
that you're moving towards a goal and so
if you don't have to have a goal while 

147
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:56,690
you can't have any positive emotion,
so better have a goal,

148
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,430
and so you might say,
well,

149
00:06:58,431 --> 00:06:59,600
what should the goal be?

150
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,400
Well,
we could start by saying,

151
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,470
well,
any goal is better than none,

152
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,700
and then we might say,
well,

153
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:09,701
it should be a goal that other people 
will let you pursue because otherwise 

154
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:12,260
it's going to be kind of difficult and 
maybe there'll be even happy to help you

155
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:14,180
pursue it.
That would even be better.

156
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,230
And maybe it's a goal that would enable 
you to learn how to pursue other goals.

157
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:19,970
Well,
you pursue that goal.

158
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,740
Boy,
that would really be good.

159
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,430
And so you can see that your goal is 
parameterized,

160
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,130
but that doesn't mean that any old goal 
works.

161
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:31,700
It means there's some goals that were 
nicely and some not so nicely.

162
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,250
There are playable games and non 
unplayable games.

163
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,940
That's a good way of thinking about it.
And you want to have a playable game and

164
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:39,920
there's a lot of them,
lawyer,

165
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,480
plumber,
you know,

166
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,670
actor,
whatever,

167
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,120
they're,
they're playable games and,

168
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,180
and it's not obvious which ones better,
but it's certainly obvious which ones 

169
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,450
are sustainable and which ones are 
worse.

170
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,750
And so there's a set of playable games 
and you need to extract from that set of

171
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:59,150
playable games,
a game that suits you.

172
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,460
And that would be partly due to your 
temperament,

173
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:06,461
you know,
because extroverted people want to play 

174
00:08:06,461 --> 00:08:08,501
an extroverted game and highly neurotic 
people want to play a safe game and 

175
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:12,760
agreeable people want to play a generous
game and disagreeable people wanting to 

176
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,560
play a game that's highly competitive so
they can win and you know,

177
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,890
fine,
but they're all within the realm of 

178
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,340
playable games.
And that means they're socially 

179
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,711
acceptable as well.
And so that means it isn't just 

180
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:31,660
arbitrary,
it isn't just relative what you decide 

181
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,690
to do,
it's heavily parameterized.

182
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,080
There's only,
there's a set of playable games and it's

183
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:37,910
large,
the set is large,

184
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,610
but it there are commonalities within 
it.

185
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,820
And that's why there are commonalities.
That's why morality has a common basis 

186
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,760
fundamentally.

187
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,550
And so that's partly what we're trying 
to investigate is like what's up?

188
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,850
What does that mean?
What does it mean?

189
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:54,710
Is there such a thing?
Now,

190
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,320
one thing to remember is that if you 
don't erect a hierarchical structure 

191
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,420
with a something to aim at,
you got no positive motivation because 

192
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,030
you experience positive motivation in 
relationship to a goal,

193
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:14,031
not from attaining the goal,
that satisfaction and besides it's 

194
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:14,910
fleeting,
you know perfectly well,

195
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:16,740
you graduate from university,
Poof,

196
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,010
next day you have a problem,
which is what do you do next?

197
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,200
And that's a.
that's a tough problem.

198
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,710
It's not like you've solved your 
problems by winning that game.

199
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,950
You just introduced the problem of 
having to introduce another game.

200
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,460
So it's unreliable as a source of 
positive emotion.

201
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:36,630
But what's reliable is you set a goal 
and you try to attain it,

202
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,990
and then that gives your life that 
literally provides your life with 

203
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:42,360
meaning.

204
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,300
That's what meaning is.
Now it's more than that,

205
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:48,300
but that's what it is.
And so then you might ask yourself,

206
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,940
well,
what's a really good goal?

207
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,940
Well,
that's what we're trying to figure out.

208
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,860
What's a really good goal?
And now,

209
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,270
okay,
so you got that.

210
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,910
So now I'm going to walk through at 
least partly through.

211
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,690
We'll see how far we get.
I'm gonna Walk Through Pinocchio with 

212
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:05,690
you because that's what the movie's 
about.

213
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,910
And it's uh,
it's hard to say how it came about.

214
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,330
Like it was written the story by a guy 
named Claudia I,

215
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,360
C o,
l l O v I,

216
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,260
it's quite a bit different.
The story,

217
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,050
that story,
the written one from the Disney version,

218
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,460
the Disney version was a product of the 
collaboration of geniuses,

219
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:26,580
of animation essentially.
So they were artistic geniuses,

220
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,730
great at capturing motion and emotion 
and all of that.

221
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,290
Be Stellar at that.
And imaginative,

222
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,590
tremendously imaginative,
but collectively imaginative.

223
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,230
And so they put together a collective 
product.

224
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,370
And you might say,
well,

225
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:42,750
how did they do that?
Exactly?

226
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:43,410
It's like,
well,

227
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,890
they were good storytellers.
What does that mean?

228
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,090
Well,
it means you know,

229
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,350
the story that works and the story that 
doesn't.

230
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,830
And maybe partly what you do is you kind
of think out a story and you think,

231
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,240
well,
what if this happens?

232
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,460
And maybe this should happen.
Oh,

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,290
that's the thing.
Oh,

234
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,500
that would work.
It's like the little flash of 

235
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,500
inspiration,
right?

236
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:06,930
It's like you got a piece of the puzzle 
that fits you think,

237
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:08,100
yeah,
that would work there.

238
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,420
And then you talk to the other people 
and you generate ideas and someone says,

239
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,020
well,
what if,

240
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,120
what if they do this?
And everyone goes now,

241
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,790
now that's just not believable.
No one's going to buy that.

242
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,190
And someone else has a little 
revelation.

243
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,700
They said,
well,

244
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,520
you know,
it makes some sense somehow with if they

245
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:24,750
do this.
And everybody goes,

246
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:25,240
Oh yeah,
that,

247
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,670
that really,
that really,

248
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,260
that really works.
It's like,

249
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,390
why?
Why,

250
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,920
why?
Why?

251
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:34,080
You don't know.
You don't know why it works,

252
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,330
but it works because it works because 
it's the right story.

253
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,000
And so what does that mean?
Well,

254
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,790
it's kind of associated with this 
metagame idea.

255
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,180
You know,
it's like there's a story that you 

256
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,980
should be acting out that works across 
games and you have an inkling of it.

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,920
Do you have a notion of it?
You have a vague apprehension of it.

258
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,950
It's sort of built into that archetype.
That's an archetype.

259
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,650
And so then when you read a story that 
works,

260
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:04,651
you're just entranced by it and you all 
know that you go to a movie and it's a 

261
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:05,680
great movie and it's like you're just 
blown away.

262
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,710
You know,
it's a movie can pull you in and turn 

263
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,341
you into one of the screen characters 
and I can run you through a huge set of 

264
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:18,241
emotions.
I saw this movie once about South 

265
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:21,570
America.
It started with this guy running out of 

266
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,041
a subway naked and he didn't know where 
he was and it turned out that he had 

267
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,310
been absconded by,
uh,

268
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,340
the totalitarian death squads and he 
couldn't remember anything about 

269
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,130
himself.
And he went back to his village.

270
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:35,131
And basically what happened was that he 
ended up back in the totalitarian death 

271
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,980
grip.
And it was,

272
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:43,750
it showed how the fascist state had 
saturated the village completely,

273
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,790
and so it was a tragedy and you could 
see with every action that this guy,

274
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,330
this amnestic guy,
as he recreated him himself and 

275
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,931
remembered his identity,
was going to travel down exactly the 

276
00:12:57,931 --> 00:13:00,901
same road because nothing had changed.
And by the time I wish I've looked for 

277
00:13:00,901 --> 00:13:03,610
what that movie was for years,
I've never been able to find it again.

278
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,880
But when the movie was over,
every single person in the theater was 

279
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,430
crying and not just a little bit.
It was like they were just out of it.

280
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,680
It was brilliant,
terrifying movie.
