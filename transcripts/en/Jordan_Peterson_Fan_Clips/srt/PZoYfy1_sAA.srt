1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,360
The system in Russia,
the Soviet Union,

2
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:07,700
which was a collection of states,
an empire,

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,590
and the system that was established in 
China and the system that still exists 

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,061
in Korea as a remnant of the Cold War 
and systems in Southeast Asia and in 

5
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:26,791
Africa were all predicated on Marxist 
presuppositions,

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,320
presuppositions that were Utopian in 
nature

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,350
and that

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,130
posited a utopian future where property 
was held in common and everyone had 

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,960
enough and everyone was called upon to 
do what they could write from each 

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,240
according to his ability to each 
according to his need,

11
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,450
which is a lovely sentiment and you can 
imagine how it would be attractive even 

12
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:59,210
intellectually because of course other 
systems,

13
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,860
all other systems produce vast 
disparities in income.

14
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,320
It's like a natural law.
It's actually governed by.

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,360
You can model it

16
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,670
with a distribution called the prieto 
distribution and the prieto 

17
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:18,670
distribution.
It looks like this.

18
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,020
It doesn't look like a normal 
distribution.

19
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:25,370
A lot of you guys have been told about 
normal distributions and how many things

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,910
follow a normal distribution.
Most things,

21
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,030
but that's really a limited case.
You can understand that prieto 

22
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:35,570
distribution,
if you.

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,220
You've all played monopoly,
I presume at the beginning.

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,140
Everyone has the same amount of money,
will include property,

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,200
the same amount of wealth and then what 
happens as the game progresses and 

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,861
really as a function of chance.
I mean I know yet you have to use your 

27
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:57,011
head a little bit monopoly,
but the basic rule is just buy 

28
00:01:57,011 --> 00:01:59,690
everything you can get your hands on and
then trade meanly,

29
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:04,691
something like that.
So at the beginning everybody has the 

30
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,080
same amount and then as you begin to 
play,

31
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,430
if you had enough players,
you would develop an,

32
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,330
a normal distribution because some 
people would win,

33
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,590
see relatively consistently and some 
people would lose relatively 

34
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:17,590
consistently.

35
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,110
And so the money starts to be 
distributed in a normal distribution.

36
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:26,111
But the thing about money and the thing 
about lots of things is that zero is 

37
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:33,641
involved in zero is a weird place 
because if you're playing a trading game

38
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,850
and you hit zero,
then you're done.

39
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,260
And so,
and it's very hard to recover from zero 

40
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,260
and you know,
it's really hard to recover.

41
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,710
You know when you're doomed and 
monopoly,

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,650
you know,
you can tell you've got some resources,

43
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,920
but there's gonna be some crisis when 
you land on some hotel and you're going 

44
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,400
to get wiped out,
you know it,

45
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:58,910
so there's a point at which you're 
headed for zero.

46
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,930
Even if you have something you know and 
you might be rescued by luck,

47
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,750
but you know when you're doomed.
So what happens is that as you continue 

48
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:19,091
to play monopoly more and more people 
stack up at zero and fewer and fewer 

49
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:24,980
people have more and more money,
and when the game is over,

50
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,910
everyone has nothing except one person.
They have all of it.

51
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,180
Now,
the funny thing about that is that in 

52
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,640
some sense that's how trading games 
work.

53
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,840
You know,
you've got.

54
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,960
You might wonder why is that,
why there is any quality in this society

55
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,260
and it's easy to consider that it's 
because the society is corrupt and 

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,960
perhaps no society is ours somewhat or 
horribly corrupt.

57
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,220
That's the variation.
There is no society that's without.

58
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:57,221
It's criminal and criminal element,
fixed element anyways.

59
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Trading Games tend to produce a prieto 
distribution so that very many people 

60
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,240
have very little and a tiny minority 
have a tremendous amount.

61
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,730
That's the one percent that you hear 
about.

62
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,820
Right?
And you know the thing about that one 

63
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,090
percent is that that's happened in every
society that's ever been studied.

64
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,690
It doesn't really matter what the 
governmental system is and it certainly 

65
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:22,690
handled.
It certainly happened under the Soviets,

66
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,670
that's for sure.
And there was a lot of people who had 

67
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,350
enough zero so they just died.
So you know,

68
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:31,610
the,
the,

69
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,970
the Utopian dream was completely 
unimplementable for a variety of very 

70
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:43,751
complex reasons.
One is that it's very hard to fight 

71
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:47,411
against that distribution pattern when 
people are trading because mirror 

72
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,790
statistics will do that.
And then there's other things that,

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,420
and I should tell you as well that the 
prieto distribution government governs a

74
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:54,320
lot of things.

75
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,380
So if you look at books,
if I remember properly last year there 

76
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:05,381
was something like a million English 
language books published and I think 500

77
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:08,660
of them sold more than 100,000
copies,

78
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,950
which is none,
right?

79
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:14,951
That's none of that 500,
you can be sure that one of them was by 

80
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:18,791
Stephen King and he took half the money 
because there's like five authors in the

81
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:23,600
English language who are on every 
airport,

82
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,310
paperback stand,
occupying the top rung,

83
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,930
and that's massive real estate,
right?

84
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:34,910
Because it's replicated everywhere and 
because they're so prominent and because

85
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:39,911
there are no names when people are in a 
hurry and they just want something to 

86
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:44,081
read,
they just grabbed that and then more 

87
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:44,081
money goes to those people and so you 
know,

88
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:48,250
success breeds success and failure 
breeds failure and it's not necessarily 

89
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,020
linear.
Now.

90
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,050
It's a really difficult thing to deal 
with and it's hard on societies because 

91
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,490
one of the things we do know is that,
you know,

92
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,940
as you stretch out the inequality,
you make men particularly on the lower 

93
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:08,570
end of the distribution,
more and more likely to be aggressive.

94
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,600
It's sort of like imagine every man has 
a threshold for violence and status is 

95
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:17,210
important to men.
Not that it's not important to women,

96
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,660
but it's a different.
It's a different kind of status.

97
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:25,661
It's status is important to men because 
it's one of the things that makes them 

98
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:28,340
marketable as partners to women's what 
actually turns out to be quite important

99
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:31,880
to men than men.
Men tend to compete with one another for

100
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:36,881
status,
hierarchy position and in a really 

101
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:40,631
unequal society.
If you're like a low rung guy then and 

102
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:46,361
you don't have any opportunity to rise 
because the society isn't structured so 

103
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:50,711
that there's mobility.
Then the more aggressive guys tend to 

104
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,330
turn into criminality and you know,
and so you could say there's a threshold

105
00:06:56,331 --> 00:07:01,331
for criminality and the more inequality 
pressure you put on a particular area,

106
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,520
geographic or political area,
the more inequality pressure you put on 

107
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,401
it,
the more men slip past that threshold 

108
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:12,800
and into criminality.

109
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,230
And you know,
there's been pretty good studies done of

110
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,580
drug gang in Chicago.
That was the best one.

111
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:22,430
As sociologist actually went and hung 
out with a drug gang for.

112
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,790
He got into it.
I guess the drug gang leader was.

113
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,160
No,
I wouldn't say necessarily narcissistic,

114
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:36,161
but that might be a reasonable way of 
thinking about it and he was kinda happy

115
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:41,381
with the idea of maybe being a subject 
of a book and and so this guy was able 

116
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:46,940
to associate with them,
got to know them quite well.

117
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,420
And then the housing project in which 
the gang was how housed was slated for 

118
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:57,551
demolition and the gang broke up and he 
got the books because the books and what

119
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:01,010
he found was the average street drug 
dealer,

120
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,040
first of all was employed in another job
as well and was making far less than 

121
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:12,341
minimum wage now.
But the guys further up the chain of 

122
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:16,490
course followed the prieto distribution.
And so there was a tiny minority of them

123
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:18,470
who were raking in a tremendous amount 
of loot.

124
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,860
And the guys at the bottom,
we're just waiting around for the 

125
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,090
possibility that they could rise up the 
hierarchy.

126
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:27,670
And you know,
it's pretty violent game.

127
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:30,500
So the chances that someone is going to 
be

128
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,780
taken out is pretty high.
And then a little slot opens up for some

129
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:41,781
opportunistic second rater.
And perhaps he can move up the 

130
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:46,641
hierarchy.
So the prieto distribution,

131
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,320
governance,
all sorts of other things too.

132
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:55,830
I mentioned it governs the popularity 
books,

133
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,170
the sales of books,
but it also,

134
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,680
it also characterizes the distribution 
of everything that people produce.

135
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,530
So if you think of creative production 
of any sort,

136
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
artistic production,
industrial production,

137
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,100
it doesn't matter.
Almost everything fails

138
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,140
and a few things succeed beyond anyone's
wildest imagination.

139
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,500
Apple's a good example of that.
No,

140
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,020
I mean the iphone,
they have their competitors,

141
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:33,021
but is it extraordinarily dominant 
product and they rake in billions of 

142
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:33,021
dollars,
I think.

143
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,240
I don't know if apple is valued at a 
trillion dollars,

144
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:40,410
but it's close to that.
And that's a lot of money.

145
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,040
And I think if I remember correctly,
it's something like this,

146
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,950
I probably have the figures wrong,
but like the top 40 people,

147
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,160
the richest 40 people in the world have 
as much money as the bottom 2 billion 

148
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,600
right now.
You know,

149
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,620
it's not like they're stuffing their 
mattresses with that money or they have 

150
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,191
a skyscraper full of cash.
That money is out in the economy doing 

151
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,860
whatever money does.
So you know,

152
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:07,470
you can't spend $28,
billion dollars,

153
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,530
so and sometimes you can even do some 
good with it.

154
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:15,531
You know,
Bill Gates seems to be doing something 

155
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,621
reasonable with his money.
But the reason I'm telling you this is 

156
00:10:18,621 --> 00:10:22,011
because one of the things you should 
know is that this proclivity for 

157
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:27,621
inequality is pervasive among the 
creative products of human beings.

158
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,350
It's the case with with goals scored in 
hockey.

159
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,650
My son told me,
and he's a reliable source on hockey 

160
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:36,650
statistics that

161
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,400
if Wayne Gretzky,
if you don't count any of the points 

162
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,861
that Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring,
he still had enough points just with 

163
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,170
assists to have more points than any 
hockey player that ever played.

164
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,560
So you know,
you even at the upper end of,

165
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,030
of,
of the distribution or some person who's

166
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,830
hot,
they're so good at what they do.

167
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:02,831
And then there's another person that's 
so much better than them that it's not 

168
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:04,130
even comparable.
And so.

169
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,120
And the benefits flow to people who are 
in that position.

170
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:13,121
And you can understand why I would say.
Because now let's say you start writing 

171
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,490
and you get a book and a rare thing,
very rare things to have happened and 

172
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:20,450
then some people read it and they like 
it,

173
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:23,450
and then of course it's much more likely
that you'll get a next book.

174
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,840
And if people like that,
well it's even more likely that you'll 

175
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,421
get a third book and then people start 
to know who you are and then because 

176
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:34,721
they know who you are,
they phone you up and offer you 

177
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:36,731
opportunities and your network grows and
it's like this exponential increase in 

178
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:42,941
your reach and your capacity for 
production and more and more flows to 

179
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:43,190
you.
