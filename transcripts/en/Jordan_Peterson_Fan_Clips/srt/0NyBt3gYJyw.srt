1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,980
Next equality,
equity,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,210
equity,
that's worse,

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:09,360
right?
Equity means equality of outcome.

4
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:13,980
It means that every single organization 
has 50 percent women and 50 percent men.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,120
It doesn't matter whether the men and 
women differ in their intrinsic 

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,981
preferences,
which by the way they do the scientific 

7
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,891
literature on that is completely clear.
It was established by the early 

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:29,301
nineties.
It was established in the Scandinavian 

9
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:31,761
countries where they've done most to 
flatten out the socioeconomic 

10
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:36,020
differential between men and women.
Didn't get rid of the differences 

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,020
between men and women.
In fact,

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,520
they became exaggerated.
The biggest personality differences in 

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,160
the world between men and women are in 
Scandinavia,

14
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:46,161
just as the biggest differences in 
interests between men and women are in 

15
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:49,071
Scandinavia because when you get rid of 
the sociocultural differences between 

16
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:54,051
men and women,
the biological differences don't 

17
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:54,900
disappear.
They maximize how else could it be,

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,020
and as I said,
the literature on that is clear and the 

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,780
way that the postmodernists radicals 
react to that is by criticizing the 

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,500
scientific method itself on their 
computers,

21
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,050
which only work of course,
because of the scientific method.

22
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:07,470
Actually.
Yeah,

23
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,080
works.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,450
You hear the egalitarianism,
Clarion call everywhere.

25
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,350
Everything should be equal.
Everything should be equally 

26
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,350
distributed.
We should strive for equity.

27
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,080
It's like wrong,
especially if you're a conservative,

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,320
wrong.
What we want are just hierarchies of 

29
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,630
competence.
Not everyone's a neurosurgeon.

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,840
You know,
if your father has a brain tumor,

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,020
you probably want a hierarchy of 
competence for neurosurgeons so you can 

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,610
pick the one that's the best so that he 
might not die.

33
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,100
That's what a hierarchy of competences 
for.

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,980
For the postmodernist,
there's no hierarchy that isn't based on

35
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,150
power.
Well,

36
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:03,151
because they think the world runs on 
power and that's why they're willing to 

37
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,260
use power to get what they want because 
it's the only thing they believe in,

38
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,930
but a valid hierarchy of competence.
It's God,

39
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:09,070
we need those things,
man.

40
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,460
We need the best plumbers.
We need the best contractors.

41
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:13,240
We need the best.

42
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,530
We knew we need the best carpenters,
we need the best lecturers.

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,680
There has to be a hierarchy of quality,
not only so that we know who the best 

44
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:28,261
are and can reward them properly,
but so that we can reward them so they 

45
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:28,390
keep being the best.
It's like you know,

46
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:30,850
if,
if you have a great educator,

47
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,050
if you have a great leader,
if you,

48
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,160
if you have a great thinker,
you want to reward them so they keep 

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,280
thinking and they keep educating so they
can tell you something.

50
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,950
It's not a reward for their intrinsic 
being.

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,160
It's a calculated move on your part to 
suck everything out of them that's 

52
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,290
valuable as fast as you can.
That's what a hierarchy of competence is

53
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:55,291
for.
And the idea is that hierarchies of 

54
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:55,291
competence don't exist is it's so 
cynical,

55
00:02:55,291 --> 00:03:00,271
it's such a pathologically cynical idea 
and it's actually quite untrue because 

56
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:02,770
here's an interesting tidbit from the 
psychological literature.

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,750
Let's say you want to determine what the
best predictors are for lifetime success

58
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,880
in a Western society.
Well,

59
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:13,190
what would you hope for?
How about intelligence there?

60
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:18,191
It'd be a good one.
Let's hope the smart people occupied 

61
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:19,300
more positions of complexity,
right?

62
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:23,170
Because they're smarter when you want it
any other way.

63
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,880
Okay.
And then so and that's great.

64
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,940
The number one predictor of 
accomplishment in western societies is 

65
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,630
intelligence.
So that means the system works.

66
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,050
What's the number to predictor 
conscientiousness?

67
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:35,890
Well,
what's that?

68
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:38,720
It's a trait marker for hard work,
so who called,

69
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,740
who gets ahead,
smart people who work hard now that 

70
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,241
doesn't account for every bit of the 
difference between people in terms of 

71
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,050
their hierarchical structure because 
hierarchies aren't perfect.

72
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:55,051
They're corrupt.
People get to the top sometimes because 

73
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:55,051
there's psychopathic,
although believe me,

74
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:59,371
a hell of a lot less than you think 
because a psychopath has to keep moving 

75
00:03:59,371 --> 00:04:03,391
from place to place because once he 
reveals himself as deceitful and 

76
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:06,741
untrustworthy,
he has to go find new soccer's to 

77
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:06,741
fleece.

78
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:08,200
So the idea that you know,
there's no distinction between a CEO and

79
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:13,201
a psychopath.
It's like that's only made by someone 

80
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:13,330
who a knows nothing about psychopaths 
be,

81
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:18,331
knows nothing about ceos and c has 
something fundamental against the entire

82
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:21,640
capitalist structure because it's simply
not true.

83
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,190
Corrupt,
sometimes greedy,

84
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,230
sometimes short,
shortsighted,

85
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,350
sometimes running companies that are 
doing their best to auger themselves 

86
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,090
into the ground and so you know it's bad
people running a dying organization,

87
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,430
but generally speaking,
it's not the case.

88
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:41,431
Our hierarchies of competence are 
reasonably functional and not only are 

89
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:41,980
they functional,
they're valuable.

90
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,010
We need to know who the competent people
are and we need to reward them and even 

91
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,590
more importantly,
we need to tell young people,

92
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,890
hey,
there's some hierarchies of competence 

93
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:52,890
out there,
like a thousand of them.

94
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,210
Go be a plumber man,
but be a good one.

95
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,350
You know,
being honest.

96
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,150
One B.
I had a plumber once,

97
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:00,250
you know,
it was the night,

98
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,800
it was the night before we were putting 
drywall in our house.

99
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:06,190
We were redoing a house and he had put 
in all the plastic piping,

100
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,620
you know,
and I was going to test the joints,

101
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:13,621
the,
they're supposed to be glued together 

102
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:13,621
with his pipe glue.
Right?

103
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,410
And I said,
I told her I had to test the joints and 

104
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:16,410
he said,
well,

105
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:16,410
you don't have to test my joints.
They never leave.

106
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:16,900
Can I thought,
yeah,

107
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,880
that's okay.
How about if I test them?

108
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,420
So I went up on the third floor and 
filled the pipes with water,

109
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,570
capping them in the basement like you're
supposed to.

110
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,640
Like half an hour later I had two inches
of water in the basement.

111
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,400
There were 30 leaking joints.
That was the night before the drywallers

112
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,770
were supposed to show up so well,
so he wasn't particularly competent.

113
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,770
That's the point of that story,
but even more so he had put a bunch of 

114
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,910
plastic pipe outside where the drywall 
would be,

115
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,440
so it would have been sticking through 
the wall.

116
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,480
So I spent a frenetic night,
you know,

117
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,200
sawing through plastic pipe and re 
gluing joints so that my.

118
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,160
So that the drywallers could come in.
What's the point if you're going to be a

119
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:54,940
plumber,
man,

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
be a good plumber because otherwise all 
you do is go out there and cause 

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,100
trouble.
We don't need people to cause more 

122
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,100
trouble.
We need people to solve problems,

123
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,170
you know?
And so you can be a tradesman and you 

124
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,911
can be,
you can make a lot of money as a trades 

125
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:09,911
person.
It's a bloody reliable,

126
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,660
honorable,
a forthright,

127
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,690
productive way of making a living.
And there is a hell of a lot of 

128
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,661
difference between a working man who 
knows what he's doing and one who 

129
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,980
doesn't both in terms of skill and 
ethics.

130
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,440
Right?
And you work with someone who knows what

131
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,760
they're doing.
It's a bloody pleasure.

132
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,090
They tell you what they're going to do,
they tell you how much it will cost.

133
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,560
They go and do it.
It works,

134
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,470
and you pay them perfect.
Everyone's happy,

135
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,950
and that's what happens when you have 
genuine hierarchies of competence and so

136
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:41,951
you to.
You listen to these panderers of 

137
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:41,951
egalitarianism,
a gallery,

138
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:45,490
egalitarianism and equity,
and they fail to recognize completely 

139
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,610
that there are differences in rank 
between people.

140
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,290
It's not such a terrible thing,
man.

141
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Maybe he wouldn't be a great lawyer like
it's certainly possible.

142
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Most people aren't,
but that doesn't mean there isn't 

143
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,631
something you could be great at.
There's lots of hierarchies to attempt 

144
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:00,860
to climb and if you fail in one,
go try in another,

145
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,070
but the point is you're still trying to 
aim for the top and what the hell are 

146
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,070
you going to do?

147
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,190
If you don't try to aim for the top,
you know,

148
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,310
flap about uselessly and whine about 
your life.

149
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,310
It's not helpful.
It will just make you miserable.

150
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,820
You're not reliable to anyone.
You can't help out in a crisis.

151
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,840
It's like,
so you tell young people,

152
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:20,460
and this is another message for 
conservatives,

153
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,980
like,
I don't care why you're going to do,

154
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:24,770
but go out there and make something of 
yourself for God's sake,

155
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:29,771
be an honest person and work and get to 
the top of whatever it is that you want 

156
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:31,490
to get to the top of you know,
and,

157
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,380
and,
and,

158
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,760
and stand up for yourself like a 
respectable human being and be a bit of 

159
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,020
a light on the world instead of a 
blight.

160
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,530
You know,
and you can tell young people that and 

161
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,961
they haven't been told that by anyone 
now and so the young men are so hungry 

162
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:46,961
for that,
that it's,

163
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:48,140
it's painful to watch.

164
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,320
They're so relieved when finally someone
finally comes up and says,

165
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,100
Hey,
you know,

166
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,480
you,
you get your act together,

167
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,470
bit discipline yourself.
See if you can learn to tell the truth,

168
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,360
concentrate on something for a year or 
two.

169
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,980
You could be a bloody world beater.
They think that's possible.

170
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,970
Wow.
That would be,

171
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,060
that would be interesting.
That might make life or life worth 

172
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,060
living.
It's like,

173
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,310
yeah,
it might.

174
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:15,311
So why don't you go do it now?
That's what the damn universities we're 

175
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:15,830
supposed to be teaching people and 
they've forgotten that.

176
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,500
I went to Harvard month ago,
month and a half.

177
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,470
He used to teach there and I talked to a
bunch of students.

178
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:24,260
You know what I told them?
It's not easy to get into Harvard,

179
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,990
you know,
like you're a Valedictorian if you're at

180
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,360
Harvard and not only are you a 
Valedictorian,

181
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,510
you're way better than most people,
at least two other things or you don't 

182
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:34,510
get in.

183
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,640
It's so like it's.
I don't know what the acceptance rate is

184
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:39,560
like five percent.
And believe me,

185
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,590
not everybody applies.
So it's a very selective school.

186
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,250
And so why am I saying that?
It's like these are high quality kids.

187
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,190
So I told them what I just told you.
It's like,

188
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,910
here you are at Harvard.
It's like get yourself educated man.

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,530
Read some books,
learn to talk,

190
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:56,880
learn to think.
Make yourself into something,

191
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,450
get the hell out there and make the 
world that put you here.

192
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,990
Happy that you were put there in that 
great institution,

193
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,260
you know?
And they came up to me afterwards and 

194
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:09,260
said,
God,

195
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,490
I wish someone would have told us that 
when we were in our first year.

196
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,690
It's like,
Jesus,

197
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,480
why didn't someone tell them that for 
God's sake,

198
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,270
it's supposed to be the greatest 
university in the world.

199
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,480
Is it so difficult to figure that out?
Well,

200
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,570
it is.
If that is what you want to have happen 

201
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,971
in the university,
you want to make cringing milk sops who 

202
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:30,420
whined about being victims while they're
going to ivy league institutions.

203
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,290
Jesus

204
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,600
pathetic.

205
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,480
Here's an old idea from Carl young.
I really liked this idea.

206
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:46,530
It's a rough one,
man.

207
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,710
It's like a psychotherapeutic scalpel.
Let's say someone's doing something to 

208
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:51,710
you.
You don't understand.

209
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,400
It's producing nothing but misery as an 
outcome.

210
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,200
It's like,
what the hell is your motivation?

211
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,210
They won't tell you.
Maybe they don't know.

212
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,330
So Carl [inaudible] advice was look at 
the outcome and infer the motivation.

213
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Okay?
So you produce a generation of students 

214
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,570
privileged beyond belief in comparison 
to the rest of like struggling humanity 

215
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,521
in all of history.
You put them in Ivy League schools and 

216
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:19,311
they come out thinking that they're 
members of an oppressed group and 

217
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:19,311
victims.
It's like,

218
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:19,620
well,
why would you?

219
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,290
Why would anyone?
Why would that happen?

220
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,550
And the answer is,
well,

221
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:28,551
that's what the people who taught them 
wanted to turn them into and then you 

222
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:28,551
might think,
well,

223
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:29,640
did they do that because they cared for 
them?

224
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,810
It seems bloody unlikely to me.
You take this great raw material,

225
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:34,420
right?
I mean,

226
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:39,421
it's taken a lot of work to make an 
institution like the University of 

227
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:42,830
Toronto are like Harvard.
We'd been working on that for thousands 

228
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,980
of years and you invite people in.
You thank God we selected you so 

229
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,281
carefully because we think you can be a 
world beater and then what we do is we 

230
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,040
don't teach you how to think.
We don't teach you how to speak.

231
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:55,041
We don't get you to read great books and
we convinced you that you're a victim 

232
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,460
and that your culture is corrupt.
So great with those people are no 

233
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,310
friends of those institutions.
I can tell you that,

234
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:01,410
and they're even less friends of those 
students,

235
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,970
so hierarchies are cough,
competence are desirable,

236
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,110
and they should be promoted.
So none of this idiot,

237
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,650
egalitarian equity,
it's not good for anyone.

238
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:14,880
First of all,
it's impossible.

239
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,740
Second,
it would be murderous to impose,

240
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,630
but third,
even if it succeeded,

241
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,520
it would fail as fast as it succeeded.
That would be how fast it would fail.

242
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,360
Why would you strive for anything if 
there was no option to strive for?

243
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,520
If everything's flat and equal?
Well,

244
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,730
when you're starving or dying than 
everyone's equal,

245
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,560
and believe me,
the egalitarian,

246
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,400
the iee Galitary and totalitarians who 
dominated the 20th century knew 

247
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,051
perfectly well how to make people equal 
and they made them equal in gulag work 

248
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:48,921
camps and in starvation,
and I'm sure we could attain that if we 

249
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:48,921
wanted to.
