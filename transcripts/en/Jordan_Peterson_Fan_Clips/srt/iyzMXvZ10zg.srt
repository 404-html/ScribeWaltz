1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,450
No,
and so when,

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:04,890
when you're telling your kids to be 
quiet and settled down,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,250
it isn't because they're making a lot of
noise being in pain is because they're 

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,661
running around like wild baboons having 
a blast and disrupting things like mad,

5
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,500
you know,
and so you got kids,

6
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:17,820
you got to settle down,
you know,

7
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:22,821
like quit having so much fun and it's,
it's kind of awful that you do that,

8
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:28,401
but,
but you do and that's because the 

9
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:32,691
emotions and the motivations have to be 
brought into like a relationship with 

10
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:35,100
one another within the person.
So that,

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,550
you know,
one thing I remember with my son who is 

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:40,550
quite,
he's quite disagreeable by temperament,

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,660
which is actually a good thing as far as
I'm concerned,

14
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:47,661
although it brings its own challenges.
And so with my daughter when she was 

15
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:51,540
misbehaving,
she was pretty agreeable and uh,

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,340
you know,
if she was misbehaving I can basically 

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,340
just look at her and then she'd quit,
you know,

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,840
but my son was like,
that was just nothing.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,890
You're looking at me.
It's like,

20
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,870
no,
that's just not gonna go anywhere man.

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,190
And so then I'd like tell them to stop 
and that really wasn't having much of an

22
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:10,660
effect either.
He just sort of made me laugh or runaway

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,760
or whatever.
I mean he was a tough little rat and you

24
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:19,761
know,
what I would do with him is he would be 

25
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:20,910
doing something and it interfered and 
he'd get upset and you know,

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,180
angry.
And so then I get them to sit on the 

27
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,180
steps and I told him,
this is when he was about to.

28
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,090
I said,
look,

29
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:28,890
you're going to sit on the steps.
That's time out.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,920
You're going to sit on the steps until 
you've got control of yourself and you 

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,050
can come back and be and play the game 
again.

32
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,410
I basically said,
be a civilized human being and then 

33
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:42,410
you're welcome again.

34
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,340
And so he'd sit on the steps.
It was so interesting to watch because 

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,370
he was just enraged.
She'd sit there like,

36
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:49,290
have you ever seen a two year old had a 
temper tantrum?

37
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,400
It's really quite the bloody phenomena.
If you ever saw an adult do that,

38
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,500
you'd like,
you'd call nine one one right away.

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,670
It's like,
oh my God.

40
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,620
And I've seen adults do that,
you know,

41
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:03,621
because people say with borderline 
personality disorder will have temper 

42
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:04,050
tantrums and it's like,
man,

43
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,540
you want to be about 30 feet away from 
that person.

44
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,890
That's for sure.
It's really.

45
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,010
But in kids it's like,
well first of all,

46
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:16,011
they're only this long.
So how much trouble can they really 

47
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:16,011
cause?
But it's like,

48
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:16,650
you know,
they're just completely gone there.

49
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:20,940
Like on the floor of their face is red.
They're just furious,

50
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:25,941
like way more furious than you ever get 
if you are even vaguely socialized 

51
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:26,610
there,
just outraged.

52
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,250
And they're kicking and hitting the 
ground and like,

53
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,130
it's like a little epileptic fit of 
anger,

54
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:37,131
you know,
they're completely controlled by their 

55
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:39,291
rage.
And we took care of one kid for awhile 

56
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,400
who he was actually a pushover,
that kid you could get him to behave by,

57
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,110
you know,
kind of shaking your finger at him.

58
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,870
But his mother thought he was really 
tough because he had her.

59
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,260
He had her figured out and one of the 
things he would do is have a temperature

60
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,210
temper tantrum.
And during the temper Tantrum,

61
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,600
he would hold his bloody breath until he
turned blue.

62
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,040
It's like,
try that,

63
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,110
like you know,
as that's your homework,

64
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,450
go home and go home and have a temper 
tantrum and while you're doing it,

65
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:04,240
hold your breath until you actually turn
blue.

66
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,480
It's like you won't be able to do it.
You don't have the willpower of a two 

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:09,480
year old,
that's for sure.

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,110
That little varmint man,
he just have a fit.

69
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,360
Then he'd hold his breath and then he 
turned blue.

70
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,230
It was like,
wow,

71
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,550
that's,
that's amazing.

72
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
And we would just like,
let them do it,

73
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,970
you know,
he turned blue and everybody would be 

74
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:22,970
gone and he'd come out of it,
you know,

75
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,050
and it didn't work.
So he just quit doing it.

76
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,450
I think he did it like twice and he 
figured out,

77
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,350
oh well that's a lot of work for very 
little outcome.

78
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:33,520
And you know,
it's not like two year olds are stupid.

79
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,380
They're,
they're not stupid.

80
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,280
They're probably smarter than you,
but they're not civilized by any stretch

81
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:40,810
of the imagination.
And so anyways,

82
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:45,811
back to my son,
I'd put them on the steps and he'd be 

83
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:45,811
like,
oh,

84
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:48,910
it's just like in other aged and trying 
to get himself together,

85
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,820
you know?
And I'd wait a few,

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,920
few,
I kind a strict rule which was as soon 

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,100
as you're done,
you're welcome again.

88
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,770
So it's completely under your control.
You,

89
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,500
you get yourself calmed down,
you come and talk to me again.

90
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,690
If you're calm enough.
So I like you,

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,600
then you're welcome back in the family.
No grudge or nothing.

92
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,590
And so it's harder than you think.
Like people think they like their kids.

93
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,550
It's like don't be thinking that they're
hard to like they're little monsters and

94
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:17,350
they're very,
very pushy and provocative.

95
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,650
And so lots of parents do not like their
children and they do terrible things to 

96
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,860
them their whole life.
So it's no joke and it's a very common.

97
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:28,690
And you know,
that was Freud's observation,

98
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:33,691
fundamental observation that a lot of 
psychopathology is rooted in the family 

99
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:34,950
and you can be sure of that.
You know?

100
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:39,951
And when you hear about some mother 
who's done something terrible to her 

101
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:40,630
child,
which happens reasonably frequently,

102
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:45,190
you know perfectly well that she has a 
very terrible capacity to discipline.

103
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,190
The child is just provoked her and 
provoked or unprovoked or provoked or 

104
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,491
unprovoked or and it just happens to be 
a day where her new boyfriend left and 

105
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:57,720
she's quite hung over and she got fired 
and it's like that's the wrong data 

106
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,370
provoker and then she does something 
that is not good and you read about it 

107
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:02,370
and you think,
well,

108
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,420
how could that happen?
How could anyone do that?

109
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,310
It will.
That's how they do it.

110
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,120
And so and kids are very provocative,
just like little chimps,

111
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,690
chimps will.
The adolescents will like throw little 

112
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,640
pebbles and sticks at the sleeping 
larger males and bug them.

113
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,830
And that teasing,
which it is,

114
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,790
that teasing turns into full fledged 
dominance challenge behavior.

115
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,070
Once the adolescent males get big enough
to do it.

116
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,890
And so when you're being provoked by a 
child,

117
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,590
which they provoke your time,
they're trying to figure out,

118
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,920
well,
where are you exactly?

119
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:38,170
What happens if I do this?
What happens if I do this,

120
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,240
you know,
and how else are they going to figure it

121
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,860
out?
Anyways,

122
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:46,861
he'd sit on the steps and just,
he's just enraged and trying to control 

123
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:48,800
himself and I've watched that and then,
you know,

124
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,080
I come back after about two minutes or 
whatever and he'd still be around,

125
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,180
I'd say,
well are,

126
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,920
you know,
have,

127
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,650
have you got yourself under control?
Are you ready to get off the steps?

128
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,870
And then,
you know,

129
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,360
he'd get himself under control and then 
he'd come back and you know,

130
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,210
he'd be contrite and then I would like 
him right away.

131
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,680
You know,
you got to watch that,

132
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:14,681
you know,
because you don't like being dominated 

133
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:14,681
by a two year old.
No one does.

134
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:19,030
And so if the child hasn't mastered 
himself and started to act in accordance

135
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:24,170
with the prevailing social norms,
you won't like them while you think,

136
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,440
oh yeah,
I will because you know,

137
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm a good person.
It's like,

138
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:27,710
no,
you won't and no,

139
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:29,960
you're not a good person.
So don't be thinking about that at all.

140
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:34,010
It's just not true.
So when he was contrite,

141
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,510
then he'd come and we'd just go on like 
nothing had happened because that's what

142
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:39,290
you want to do,
right?

143
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,350
As soon as you get compliance,
especially if the compliance is in the 

144
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,460
best interest of the child,
you want to reward it instantly,

145
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,850
right?

146
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,020
That's the right thing to do because so 
then and,

147
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,780
and you could just see him gaining 
control over himself.

148
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:58,190
And so really what was happening is his,
in his mind,

149
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,450
in his brain will say there was a war 
between the psyche,

150
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:07,451
the ego that was starting to become 
integrated and starting to become a 

151
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:08,840
continuous person,
an identity,

152
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,440
and it's fragile in two year olds and it
can be disrupted all the time.

153
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:14,930
And it is.
That's why they're so hyper emotional.

154
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:19,931
It's fragile,
that little eagle and it doesn't have a 

155
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:22,691
lot of power.
And so what you want to do is reward it 

156
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:23,180
when it wins.
You know when it,

157
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,730
when he gets control over the underlying
motivations,

158
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:26,330
you want to say,
hey,

159
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:28,160
good work man,
good work kid.

160
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,300
You did it.
You know,

161
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,910
you got yourself under control way to 
be.

162
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,060
And the kids really happy about that 
because it's actually not that much fun 

163
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,000
to have a temper tantrum.
It's exhausting,

164
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,700
you know,
it takes you over question.

165
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,590
Oh,
just pat on the head or you know,

166
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,830
that's good.
You're kind word,

167
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:49,460
you know,
or,

168
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,290
or whatever earth.
Yeah.

169
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,610
Notice it.
Pay Attention.

170
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,570
That's it.
That's it.

171
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,610
Pay Attention.
And that's a great.

172
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,090
It's a great thing to know with people 
like in your relationships here.

173
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,210
Here's the key to a good relationship.
It's not the only one,

174
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:06,710
but watch your person carefully,
carefully,

175
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,980
carefully,
and whenever they do something that you 

176
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,261
would like them to do more of,
tell them that that was really good and 

177
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:18,371
mean it.
And it's not manipulative because if 

178
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:18,371
it's manipulative it won't work.
It's like you have to say,

179
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:19,580
wow,
I'm so glad you did that.

180
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:24,581
Did you have to be precise?
Here's what you just did that I thought 

181
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:25,970
was great and Oh boy,
that's so nice that you've noticed.

182
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,860
I can't believe they could notice.
It's like,

183
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,380
you know,
you do that 20 times and the person will

184
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:35,381
be like the rat.
That's just pushing the lever for 

185
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:35,381
cocaine.
You know,

186
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:35,381
so,
but no,

187
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,060
I'm serious.
It's skinner established this bf skinner

188
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,120
noticed this a long time ago.
Reward is intensely useful in terms of 

189
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,831
modifying behavior,
but the problem is is that it's really 

190
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:48,590
hard to notice when things are going 
right,

191
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,370
right?
Because you're kind of prime to notice 

192
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,440
when things are going wrong and so you 
use threat and punishment more often as 

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,420
agents of,
of shaping the people that you're around

194
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,310
because you know when everything's going
right,

195
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:02,730
it's like,

196
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,870
what are you going to say?
Everything's going right.

197
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,900
It turns to zero.
You just assume it and that's,

198
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,060
that's not good.
That's not good.

199
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,730
You want to pay attention and if the 
person,

200
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,990
your children,
your wife,

201
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:18,270
your whoever,
your mother,

202
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,300
your sister,
if you want them to,

203
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,520
if you want to rectify your 
relationships with them,

204
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,770
and I'm not saying to do this in a 
manipulative wait,

205
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,800
won't work,
but if they do something that's 

206
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:32,800
promoting harmony and peace and 
goodwill,

207
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,480
it's like attend to it.
Tell them that you noticed.

208
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:40,481
It's like it's so useful and you have to
get rid of your grudges and your 

209
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:40,940
resentment to do that.
Right?

210
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:45,941
Because you don't want you to kind of 
mad at your sister and then you know 

211
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:45,941
what,
if she does something good,

212
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:47,630
you think there is no god damn way,
I'm going to reward you for that.

213
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:49,910
So you ignore her when she does 
something good.

214
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:51,530
It's like,
that's brilliant.

215
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:55,010
That is because then you've just 
punished her for doing what you want.

216
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,620
And people do that with their kids all 
the time,

217
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,080
you know,
because they let the kids dominate them.

218
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,700
Then they get resentful.

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Then the kid will run up to them to show
them something that's kind of 

220
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,220
spectacular and they'll,
they're not happy.

221
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,090
They'll think,
oh yeah,

222
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,750
that's,
you know,

223
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,290
I'm,
I'm,

224
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,100
I'm working.
You know,

225
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:16,210
little kid has all sad about that and 
he's just learned something so.

226
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,680
And it's not perhaps what you want them 
to learn.

227
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,370
And so you have to keep your,
your relationship with your children 

228
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,821
pristine.
And that means that you can't hold a 

229
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:31,451
grudge or resent them.
And that means that you have to help 

230
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:32,270
them learn how to behave so that you 
liked them.

231
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,660
And that way if they,
if you like them and you're kind of 

232
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,480
sensible and maybe your partner also 
likes them,

233
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:40,670
so you know,
you got a consensus going there,

234
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,820
there's a reasonable possibility that 
other people will actually liked them 

235
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,250
too,
including other children.

236
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,260
And then the world will open up to them,
you know,

237
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,310
then you'll bring them to people's 
houses and the people will actually 

238
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,480
smile at them and give them a pat on the
head and instead of thinking,

239
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,480
oh my God,
that Brad's coming to visit again,

240
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,710
I wonder what will break this time,
you know?

241
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,710
And that's just a horrible thing for 
your child to experience repetitively in

242
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:11,321
situation after situation.
All they learned is that adults have a 

243
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,160
false smile,
but they're really lying all the time.

244
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,770
God,
it's like a bit of hell.

245
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,080
And there's a lot of children who are 
trapped in that.

246
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:23,081
It's really awful to see.
I can see kids like that when I walked 

247
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:23,081
down the street,
you know,

248
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:26,840
it's like their little doomed things and
there they are and you know,

249
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,200
they're screwed in 15 different ways and
there's no way out of it.

250
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:35,201
It's really awful,
so I would not recommend that you do 

251
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:39,311
that.
It's better to notice that you're a bit 

252
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:41,411
of a monster or a lot of a monster and 
notice that you are much happier with 

253
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:47,951
the people around you when they behave 
in accordance with reasonable source 

254
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:51,160
social norms and then you actually feel 
genuinely connected to them and you want

255
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:53,800
to work on their behalf so that 
everything out.

256
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,280
But if you think you're a good person 
and that you'd never do anything that 

257
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,221
was harmful to your children,
then you can just forget about that 

258
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,490
because you'll never take it seriously 
enough to actually learn.

259
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,000
So.
Alright.

260
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,100
So anyways,
we live inside this story as far as I 

261
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,580
can tell and you know,
we kind of put the story together inside

262
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:17,581
us to begin with and that happens 
between two and four when you're 

263
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:20,970
integrating those motivations and 
emotions into a relatively functional 

264
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,480
unity.
Right?

265
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,050
And,
and,

266
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:28,051
and,
and that does happen between two and 

267
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:30,031
four.
If you don't have your kids socialized 

268
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,191
by the time,
therefore you might as well just forget 

269
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:34,441
it.
And I know that sounds terribly 

270
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:36,691
pessimistic and all of that,
but I know the literature on trying to 

271
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:39,370
rectify antisocial behavior in children 
and after the age of four,

272
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:41,470
it's virtually impossible no matter what
you do.

273
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,970
And the reason for that is that kids who
are still acting like two year olds when

274
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:47,730
they're for that,
you know,

275
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,830
they're twice as old as a two year old.
That's a lot of difference like four 

276
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,420
year olds in adult as far as the two 
year old is concerned.

277
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,150
And so if the four year old is still 
acting like a two year old,

278
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:03,151
that's really not good.
And other four year olds will come up 

279
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:05,020
and you know,
do a little play invitation like the dog

280
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,060
and you know,
the,

281
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,150
the kid a two year old,
four year old has no idea how to react 

282
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,530
to that.
And so the more mature kid thinks,

283
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,890
oh,
well how about a play with you?

284
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:20,070
And then that kid is isolated from the 
peers and after four year mostly 

285
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,620
socialized by your peers.
And so you just fall farther and farther

286
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,520
and farther behind.

287
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,520
You're more and more alienated.
You're more bitter and angry and no 

288
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,680
wonder and it's just not.
You can't rectify it so,

289
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,980
so,
so that's useful to know.

290
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,640
It's like your job from two to four is 
to turn your child,

291
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,510
help turn your child into a functional 
unity and buy three.

292
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:48,511
They should be functional enough as a 
unity within themselves so that they can

293
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:53,620
concentrate on a voluntary goal for some
reasonable length of time,

294
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,400
which is also why it's useful to let 
them spend some time alone so that they 

295
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,820
can learn to amuse themselves because if
they can use themselves,

296
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:05,821
they're not going to be able to play 
with other kids and then by three 

297
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:09,180
they're sorted together enough.
So if another three year old comes 

298
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,791
along,
they can at least play in parallel and 

299
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:15,301
may also start,
may be able to start playing a 

300
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,200
cooperative game.

301
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,800
And so that's often a fantasy game,
you know,

302
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,420
pretend.
And so what the kids will do it.

303
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,680
Sometimes they mediated verbally,
but sometimes it's,

304
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,120
it's more acted out.
It's a combination of the two.

305
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,570
They'll assign each other rules.
They'll do this with you too.

306
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,400
It's like let's have a tea party.
Well,

307
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,200
what does that mean?
Well,

308
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:40,201
it means let's sit down and act out the 
act of sharing food and see if we can 

309
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:43,210
get that right.
That's what the kid saying.

310
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,980
I'll have a little tea party.
You know,

311
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:47,200
it's very important because human being 
shared food,

312
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,210
like this is a major thing to get right 
man.

313
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,630
And so the kid will say,
well you be the mom and I'll be the dad 

314
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,301
and you know,
we'll make little fort and that'll be 

315
00:14:58,301 --> 00:14:58,301
our house and we'll go in there and 
we'll run our roles and you know,

316
00:14:58,301 --> 00:15:01,850
we're acting out,
we're acting out family.

317
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,080
And,
and if,

318
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,990
if were both reasonably civilized as 
three year olds,

319
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,170
we can concentrate on that goal.
We can establish that little fictional 

320
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:11,510
world.
We can,

321
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,520
we can negotiate our mutual goal and 
then we can run the simulation.

322
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,670
And that's what kids are doing when 
they're pretending it's bloody 

323
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,670
brilliant.
That's play man.

324
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,760
It's like,
it's brilliant.
