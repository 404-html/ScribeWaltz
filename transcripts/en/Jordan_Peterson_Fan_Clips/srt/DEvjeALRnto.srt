00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,160
Hello Dr Peterson,
thank you very much.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:07,630
And my question is regarding Adhd,
which is something I haven't heard you 

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,880
speak a whole lot about,
maybe a little bit.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,140
Um,
now it seems to me that we are at least 

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,810
maybe just me do not quite understand 
adhd to what could be its full capacity 

6
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:23,211
maybe and because there's many,
many voices saying that it's an 

7
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:27,831
overdiagnosed overblown small mental 
variants that's prevalent in boys or 

8
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:32,430
it's just young boys being young boys 
and then there are some that would fight

9
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:37,350
and advocate for a very different 
treatment in the academic world.

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,870
And I was wondering what you,
what your thoughts are on Adhd itself.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,440
Um,
and on the,

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,770
whether you think it's overdiagnosed and
maybe advice for me as someone who has 

13
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,571
been diagnosed with adhd on how to 
overcome it without maybe becoming 

14
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:59,640
completely reliant on prescribed 
medication.

15
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:00,950
Okay.

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,290
Okay.
So first of all,

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,910
it's definitely overdiagnosed.
Second,

18
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:13,400
it's very unreliable.
Psychiatric diagnosis.

19
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,490
Many psychiatric diagnosis are 
unreliable and that's because 

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,450
psychiatric diagnosis aren't precisely 
scientific categories.

21
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:21,740
They're weird hybrids,
right?

22
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:23,960
First of all,
psychiatrists aren't scientists.

23
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:28,961
They're engineers.
Engineers are trying to do something 

24
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:31,811
rather than to describe the objective 
world and psychiatrists are trying to 

25
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:32,180
make people healthy.
Whatever that means.

26
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,300
It's actually partly ethical.
It's very complicated.

27
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,630
We don't know how to distinguish it from
temperamental variation,

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,080
so for example,
if you're high in openness and high in 

29
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,080
extroversion and low in 
conscientiousness,

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,720
low in agreeableness,
conscientiousness and and high in 

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,291
neuroticism,
you're likely to manifest symptoms of 

32
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,590
Adhd.
It's because your exploratory,

33
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,110
you don't like to sit down,
you're full of ideas.

34
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:08,111
Your attention scatters across a wide 
variety of topics and you're not very 

35
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:12,191
stable.
Temperamental variation is also much 

36
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:12,191
more common among boys.

37
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,090
Panksepp showed same guy with rats that 
if you deprive young routes of rough and

38
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:25,331
tumble play,
which is what the young boys are 

39
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:28,211
deprived of in school,
let's say that they get hyperactive and 

40
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,110
then their prefrontal cortex is don't 
develop very well because they're not 

41
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,871
having the right kind of experiences and
that you can treat that quite 

42
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:39,140
effectively with psychomotor stimulants 
like Ritalin.

43
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,310
So that's kind of an interesting bit of 
scientific information that no one pays 

44
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,121
any attention to.
There is also absolutely no evidence 

45
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:52,781
whatsoever that longterm use of 
psychomotor stimulants produces 

46
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,020
increases in cognitive gain,
zero,

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,210
and there's plenty of evidence that it's
harmful.

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,960
So then the second part of that was what
about,

49
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,460
yeah,

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,220
adjustments for in the academic world,
say disability adjustments.

51
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:16,711
It's like,
that's such a rat's nest that I don't 

52
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:16,711
want to even discuss it.
I mean it,

53
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,750
it,
I'll discuss it for like 15 seconds.

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,330
There is a never ending multiplication 
of disability.

55
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,810
That's what's happening right now.
The disability offices in the 

56
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,550
universities are swamp.
Like I know some people have it rough,

57
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,350
like believe me,
I know that I,

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,960
I,
I seriously know that I've dealt with 

59
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,050
extraordinarily damaged people in my 
life.

60
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,720
You,
you're,

61
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,730
you're bloody hard pressed to find 
someone who doesn't have a serious 

62
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,291
problem or who doesn't have a serious 
problem in a close family member.

63
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,010
It's like,
where do you draw the line with regards 

64
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,530
to disability where you can't,
you can't.

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,700
They multiply just like lgbt identities.
Multiply.

66
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,880
Just knows.
She really technically just like that.

67
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,840
Just like intersectionality categories 
of oppression multiply.

68
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:12,870
It's,
it's,

69
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,160
it's inevitable the way that you deal 
with it.

70
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:19,160
As you have objective standards,
you apply them to everyone.

71
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,160
Not because that's fair.
It's not fair.

72
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:27,161
If you.
If your criteria for fairness is that 

73
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:27,620
everyone has the same outcome.
It's not fair at all.

74
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:32,621
It's not even close to fair.
It's just less piratical than the 

75
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:36,521
alternatives.
Now we don't know that yet because we 

76
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:39,311
haven't seen the full range of the 
tyranny of the alternatives manifests 

77
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:39,920
itself,
not in our culture,

78
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:43,820
but it certainly did in other cultures.
I think it's a bad idea now.

79
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,080
I don't want to be absolute about that.
Like it's tricky,

80
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,000
you know,
because if you have a disability

81
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,280
that

82
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,570
would allow you to do the work in the 
university and in the workplace with a 

83
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,451
modification,
then perhaps the modification could be 

84
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:11,291
made,
but I think that was done a lot better 

85
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:11,291
when I was in the hands of the 
professors and not in the hands of these

86
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,100
crazy bureaucratic structures that have 
risen up around the disability issue.

87
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,460
Like they're one of the 10 things that 
are going to kill the universities or 

88
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,061
maybe have already killed them possibly 
because they made their walking corpses 

89
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:28,100
as far as I can tell zombies,
so and that might be wrong,

90
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:33,101
but that's what it looks like to me 
versus I want to say thank you so much 

91
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:36,680
is an amazing talk and I was wondering 
if you could elaborate.

92
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:41,681
What I noticed a lot,
I go here to UBC is that a lot of 

93
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,010
students and young people,
they're often desensitized to,

94
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:48,011
for example,
the atrocities that communism or 

95
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,621
ideologies that forced terrorism and 
maybe it's some sort of Stockholm 

96
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:54,170
syndrome that I'm seeing where it's like
people are just there,

97
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,220
they're like trapped and they can't.
They feel in way they can do anything

98
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,680
about it and then they start to like,
like,

99
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,740
like communism or they start to see more
social or adopt socialist policy that in

100
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,470
the end we'll get them killed.
We'll get them hurt.

101
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,120
As long as you kind of elaborate on what
you think can be done about that or even

102
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:16,370
if something can be done in that 
respect.

103
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,460
Well,
I think something can be done.

104
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,160
I mean,
I've been trying to educate people about

105
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,190
the horrors of the Nazi regime in the 
Soviet regime in particular.

106
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,180
I've concentrated mostly on those two 
cars,

107
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:35,181
but that's good enough and trying to let
people know that it was through the 

108
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:39,700
fault of people,
much like them,

109
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:44,701
that those systems are rows and,
and that there are steps you can take to

110
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:51,601
limit the probability that you would 
participate in such a thing and that 

111
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:55,651
those steps are associated with trying 
to be truthful in your speech and 

112
00:06:55,651 --> 00:06:59,641
actions because the stability of those 
systems depends on the willingness of 

113
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:03,721
individuals to lie and,
and also on your willingness to take 

114
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:07,420
responsibility for the malevolence in 
your own heart.

115
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,270
That manifests itself in those social 
movements.

116
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,070
And so that when I've done,
when I do my lectures,

117
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,380
when I do talks like this,
when I put them on Youtube,

118
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,410
what I'm trying to do is exactly that 
because that was the best pathway 

119
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:30,160
forward through such things that I could
think up over 20 years of thinking about

120
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:30,280
it.

121
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,130
Um,
you know,

122
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:38,131
one is so habituated to suffering that 
they can read the Gulag archipelago,

123
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,900
which is actually quite hard to read 
without having an effect them like your 

124
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,710
psychopathic.
If that book doesn't affect you,

125
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,150
you know,
it should,

126
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,720
if you read it properly,
it affects you deeply.

127
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,350
And it's not the only example of that 
kind of literature.

128
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:05,010
So the people who are habituated aren't,
they've just been shown low resolution 

129
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,800
representations of things they don't 
understand that looked vaguely bad.

130
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:14,030
They don't know a damn thing about them.
And our education system has done a 

131
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,910
tremendously appalling job of educating 
young people about the absolute 

132
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:22,870
catastrophe of radical leftism.
Now it's not much better with regards to

133
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,140
say the actions of the Nazis,
although I would say on average people 

134
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,110
are more aware of that,
but they don't.

135
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,420
But it's shallow,
shallow knowledge.

136
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,140
So you make the knowledge deep and deep 
knowledge changes people and wakes them 

137
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,420
up.

138
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,230
You know?
I mean,

139
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:43,590
the only reason that I ever got 
convinced that they're that good and 

140
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:43,590
evil,
we're real more,

141
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,350
more real than anything else wasn't 
because I learned that good was real.

142
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,530
That's hard.
That's hard.

143
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,880
It's hard to learn that you have to find
examples of transcendent good,

144
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:56,160
you know,
they're rare,

145
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,550
evil.
All you have to do is look,

146
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,360
read history a bit and read it like it's
about you and there's no way that you 

147
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,920
can do that without a transformation,
but people won't do it.

148
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,590
It's like you want to imagine yourself 
as an Auschwitz guard.

149
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,980
That's a rough thing you see because you
have to figure out,

150
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,920
see young set,
if you confronted the shadow,

151
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,500
which was the dark side of people,
the aggressive side,

152
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,460
the malevolent side,
that it,

153
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,550
it really reaches all the way down to 
hell and Dante sort of was trying to put

154
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,430
forward the same thing when he wrote the
inferno,

155
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:32,760
right?

156
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,230
With the levels of evil,
right?

157
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,420
Because it was a voyage through the 
levels of evil,

158
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:38,780
right to the bottom.
He thought the bottom was betrayal.

159
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,630
It's pretty good.
The,

160
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,950
the most,
the center of malevolence as betrayal.

161
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,440
I liked that because to be trained 
someone,

162
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,260
you have to get them to trust you,
and trust is a moral virtue,

163
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,120
right?
Especially if it's courageous trust,

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,240
because it it,
it puts you in alignment with other 

165
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,431
people and allows you to move forward 
into life and if you'd be trained that 

166
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:58,431
you really,
it's like a knife in the.

167
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,540
It's like knife in the heart,
through the back,

168
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,120
especially if it's someone who loves,
loves you,

169
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:08,121
betrays you,
and especially if they be trey you for 

170
00:10:08,121 --> 00:10:08,280
your virtues.
That's a really nice twist.

171
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,820
So I believe because I think that people
are capable of good,

172
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,590
that if they know enough about evil that
that will straighten them out.

173
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,590
So,
but who wants that?

174
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,890
You know,
this is one of the things I really like 

175
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,571
about young.
He's often regarded as a new age 

176
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:29,571
thinker.
That's wrong.

177
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,180
He's no new age thinker.
He knew that the,

178
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,550
the pathway to enlightenment was barred 
by the necessity of a passage through 

179
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:42,900
hell and that no one was going to do 
that.

180
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,560
That's why there isn't a world full of 
enlightened people.

181
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:51,561
You might say like it was just a matter 
of doing nice things following your 

182
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:54,660
bliss.
Let's say however you might put it.

183
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,670
Then why wouldn't everyone walk up the 
stairway to heaven?

184
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,540
That isn't how it works.
That's not how it works at all.

185
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,170
I don't think you can be convinced of 
the necessity for moral action until you

186
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:12,171
understand exactly how dark and terrible
things can get and that it's your fault 

187
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,270
that they're getting that way.
Who wants to think that?

188
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,740
So you can think it though,
but not.

189
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,640
Not Without it burning you.
So thanks.
