00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.910
Okay.
I want to mention again,
campaign monitor.
Campaign monitor is a,

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.460
a tool I'm told that,
uh,

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.640
helps you send great looking emails to a large audience and it has templates and

4
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:20.090
drag and drop editors and full support seven days a week.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.530
I'm having a lot of trouble understanding exactly what campaign monitors all

6
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:28.880
about and so I'm going to reach out to the company next week,

7
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.721
uh,

8
00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:34.721
and really get into it so that I can better promote their product.

13
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.340
Hey,
Sonia.
In other way,
I'm always saying,
ah,
I got to go to the gym.

14
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:03.300
I'm going to jump on the treadmill.
I want to bring my iPhone,
but oh man,

15
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:08.190
do I have to bring the whole iPhone?
I say that.
Okay,
good.
Plan along will anyway.

16
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.730
Uh,
there's a great device.
If that's your problem,
it's called Palm.

17
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.970
It's back and it's available on Verizon.

18
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.850
It's this small companion device.

19
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:21.600
It syncs with your existing smartphone and it seamlessly connected.

20
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.970
You get to do all this stuff you can with your smart phone,

21
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.090
but it's much smaller.
That's nice.
Yeah.

22
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.490
You pressed the Internet.

23
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.670
Okay.
That's just because I put my phone down sideways.
See,

24
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.570
I shouldn't have an iPhone.
It's ridiculous.
I should need something smaller.

25
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.660
What could I get that smaller that seamlessly connects to my iPhone?

26
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.250
I mean off the top of my head may be a Paul.
I should get a palm.
Palm is great.

27
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.600
Not a replacement for your smartphone,
but a great ancillary device.

28
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.810
I hope I use that word correctly.
Go to palm.com to learn more.

29
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.720
Run to your nearest Verizon store.
Don't really run.

30
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.230
Just get there quickly and safely and checkout pawn for yourself.

31
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.773
<v 0>Hi.</v>

32
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.270
<v 1>Hi.
My name is Ron Funches</v>

33
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.970
and I feel grateful and excited about being Conan O'Brien's brand.

34
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.810
I've always wanted to be

35
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.473
<v 0>phones.</v>

36
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.030
<v 1>Hey there.
Welcome to Conan O'brien needs a friend.</v>

37
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.100
This is the show where I use basically a podcast to meet people,

38
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.600
see if there'll be my friend or talk to friends and wonder why we're not better

39
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:55.710
friends.
It's a scam,
really.
The one that seems to be working.

40
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.070
I'm here with my trusty assistant,
Sonoma of Sassy and hey,
sona.
Hi.

41
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.330
<v 2>You think I'm a pretty cool guy,
right?
And my producer Matt Gorley.</v>

42
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.450
Hi.
Thank you,
Matt.
You,
uh,
you are the glue that holds this thing together.

43
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.270
I'm trying.
Yeah,
you really are.
You are the gums.

44
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.590
You're the fleshy red gums that hold the teeth in alignment.

45
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.970
You're covered in saliva and you're prone to disease.

46
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.620
Anyway,

47
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.360
today's guest is a hilarious comedian

48
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.040
<v 3>and also a terrific,
terrific human being.
I just toured with him.</v>

49
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.330
His name is Ron Funches,

50
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.420
<v 2>my podcast just at my house.
And my mom brings you coffee.
Will you do it?</v>

51
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.810
I will do it.
You know,

52
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.580
I want to point out to people that I've been touring with you and I just spent,

53
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.371
I don't know,

54
00:03:55.371 --> 00:04:00.371
almost a week with you and got to know you really well.

55
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.960
I've always known you always loved your comedy.

56
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.680
I love you as a comic and I love Your Voice,

57
00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:10.610
both your actual voice and your view of the world.

58
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.580
You do this thing as a comedian.
That is so rare,

59
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.070
you almost start your act by saying,

60
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.590
I like to talk about things that make me happy.

61
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.630
I like to talk about positive things.

62
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.310
And so many comics come out and they have an ax to grind or they're talking

63
00:04:25.311 --> 00:04:28.700
about what's wrong with the world and you just talk about things that make you

64
00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.820
happy and it's,
and it's hilarious.
It's really funny,

65
00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:33.170
but it's a completely unique approach.

66
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.820
<v 3>Um,
and it's just what I like to do,</v>

67
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.720
especially when I realized the job was saying the same jokes over and over and

68
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:41.670
over again.
Um,
I was like,

69
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:44.530
I don't want to go out there and be angry every night and,

70
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.060
and manufacturer and some anger or,
um,
and I don't,

71
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:51.540
that doesn't mean I like to try to shy away from negative aspects of my life is

72
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:55.740
just in general,
my,
my viewpoint and the perspective I have,

73
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.730
I try to keep as what is the positive of the situation.

74
00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:01.530
I tried to write my jokes about that.

75
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:05.700
And one of my favorite jokes when I was first starting out was just this joke I

76
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:10.620
wrote about the time where I was crossing the street from my apartment to a

77
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.760
convenience store and I was stuck in the middle of this intersection and this

78
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:18.660
guy just yelled at me and was like,
use the crossword cross walk inward.

79
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.730
And I would use the crosswork crosswalk and word wow.
And um,

80
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.420
and so to me,
I,
you know,
just like you're like,
oh,
there's nothing negative,

81
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.420
nothing positive about that.
But I took a joke about that and I was like,
oh,

82
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:31.860
he's just worried about my safety

83
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.790
would really prove her and he doesn't want to hit me.
He's

84
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.380
<v 2>racist.
But uh,
he is concerned for your safety.
Yes.
So,
okay.</v>

85
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.210
So there's some pieces that up there.
He's a safety conscious racist.
I see.

86
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.230
You really did find the silver lining.
Uh,
you know,
it's,

87
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.870
it's funny too because you come out as it as a,

88
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.920
when you hit the stage as a comic,

89
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.110
it's so interesting because the things you're talking about are things that you

90
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.810
wouldn't guess it all from looking at you.
Like you say,

91
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:09.200
I love rat professional wrestling.
I didn't know that.

92
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.480
It's not something that I would have assumed that you loved,

93
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.260
that you love professional wrestling and you delight in professional wrestling.

94
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.040
I think you really believe it's the greatest form of entertainment in the

95
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.480
history of the world.
Yes.

96
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.550
<v 3>Is the best.
And um,
it's the most open as far as like,
look,
we're fake.</v>

97
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.860
You know,
we're not real.
We're fake fight.
And um,
it was,

98
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.930
it overall we're all just working together to entertain people.

99
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.130
We're not trying to hurt each other.

100
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:38.240
To me that makes way more sense than something like UFC or boxing where you're

101
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:41.390
like real legitimate,
really trying to hurt each other.
Right.

102
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.570
And then that's why these people end up doing five or six fights and then they

103
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:49.460
have to retire.
And it's just like,
why don't you just do 30 years of fake fights?

104
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.240
And you make more money.
It makes sense to me.
Yeah.
More entertaining to me.

105
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:56.960
I don't want you getting hurt.
It's not entertaining to me.
Right.

106
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.700
It's like the show is entertaining to me.
Right.
You know,

107
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.710
so that's how I look at it.

108
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.840
<v 2>You,
uh,
you also,
you ate ally's Dwayne the Rock Johnson.
Yeah.</v>

109
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.460
But I mean a lot of people do,
but you have,
he's like a God like figure to you.

110
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.430
<v 3>Yeah.
Just because he did so many great things in wrestling.</v>

111
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.270
He's the best wrestler ever because he became extremely popular at wrestling and

112
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:24.260
then he left and didn't movies and then was great at that and then never had to

113
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:28.130
come back.
He's still wrestles when he wants to,
but he doesn't have to go back.

114
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:33.110
He doesn't need the money.
And he took his,
a lot of wrestlers,
you know,
they,

115
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.240
they get hot and you get a little bit of fame,

116
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.200
but they don't know how to handle their money and they never transitioned into

117
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:42.050
something else.
And he was one of the first people that was like,

118
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.420
I'm going to take these same skills that makes me great.

119
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:47.660
And wrestling and I'm gonna apply those to acting and I'm going to do roles that

120
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.900
people don't expect me to do.
I'm not just going to do action movies.

121
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:54.290
I'm going to do all types of movies.
And,
and he was the tooth fairy.

122
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:57.980
He was a to fairy.
But he do,
I mean he did a lot of the things he was in.
Um,

123
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.150
I think gets shorty,
he had a really small cameo role but was really good.

124
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:05.780
We played a really against type and um,
I was just,
that's when I was like,
oh,

125
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:09.830
he is taking the series came in the fast and furious movies.
I do,

126
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.520
why I learn to like them now because my son loves them so much.

127
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.700
<v 2>This is the secret to those movies,</v>

128
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:19.240
especially as they progress once you get to four or five,
six,
seven,

129
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.700
I think they're on 55 now one.

130
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.870
But the thing I learned about those movies is watched them as comedies and,

131
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.220
and uh,
Larry,

132
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.840
they are absolutely fucking laugh out loud.

133
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.680
Hilarious.
And there's a scene in particular that I was watching it.

134
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.790
I think maybe I was talking to you about this.
There's a scene in,

135
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.540
I think it's maybe too fast and furious movies ago before they battled a

136
00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:45.100
submarine with cars,

137
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.490
but there was a scene where the rock and vin diesel,

138
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.850
and this might be the beginning of where you can tell they don't like each
other,

139
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.620
but the rock and vin diesel have to be saying goodbye to each other at the end

140
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.454
of the movie.

141
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.840
And they're a chin to chin almost staring at each other.

142
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.720
<v 3>But each looking past each other while they're having a conversation and you</v>

143
00:09:08.721 --> 00:09:13.040
need to go and look at that.
I think it might be,
it is one of the most amazing,

144
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:16.850
they made a choice and I think it was they neither character.

145
00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:19.730
Each character thought they were too cool to look at the other character.

146
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.220
So they're looking past each other,

147
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:26.420
but their faces are almost touching and I've never seen two humans interact like

148
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:30.300
that before.
It's beautiful.
I just want her not to,
you know,

149
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.290
crazy.
Just the behind the scenes on that type of thing.

150
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.880
There's so many egos on the fast and the furious that I imagine,

151
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.670
I love to see it.
I'd love to see it.

152
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.630
I'm going to say something and you don't think I'm crazy.
I shot something with

153
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.570
<v 2>uh,
the rock.
I shot a remote with him.
I want to say about,
uh,
nine months ago.</v>

154
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.830
It was during a period when I was working out hard and the rock showed up and I

155
00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:54.130
swear to

156
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.480
<v 3>God I think I could take them in a fight.</v>

157
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.020
I was looking at him and I was thinking I'm going to go for it.

158
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.350
I think I could take him.
I think first of all I would have surprise.

159
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.450
Yeah you would definitely has surprise.

160
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.540
No one would see that come and no one would see that coming.
And I would,

161
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.960
I would go,
I would go in hard and quick like that's just,

162
00:10:13.961 --> 00:10:17.410
and I would try and do too.
We'll take the leg.
Uh No,
no,
no.

163
00:10:17.411 --> 00:10:20.530
I would go first of all I'd go for his face cause I know that he would be self

164
00:10:20.531 --> 00:10:23.110
con cause he's a movie star.
Yeah.
To be a little panic

165
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.010
<v 2>and worried about his face.
So I'd go for the face and then I would just,</v>

166
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.540
I would rip through his chest.
I would just go through him like a wild animal.

167
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.880
<v 3>I mean you have that type of look.</v>

168
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.720
I feel like there's a part of you that has it raged at your height and,

169
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.810
and are not hiding.
You know,
I am a very angry guy.

170
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.830
I am a very,
you know,

171
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.370
people that know me know I'm an angry guy and then I'm trying to be nice.

172
00:10:48.371 --> 00:10:51.700
I really am.
It's just,
I'm trying to have good pencils at all.

173
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.200
I don't think that's true at all from the time that we spent together this last

174
00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.130
week is one the reasons why I feel,
um,
closer to you is that I was like,

175
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.350
Oh I think you have to be nice.

176
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.910
I think sometimes you don't want to be as nice as you are,
but you,
you,

177
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.140
there's something in you that makes you be nice.
And,

178
00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:10.720
and I had that in me as well.
Um,

179
00:11:10.721 --> 00:11:14.230
but I just see the way that you interact with fans after the show and when

180
00:11:14.231 --> 00:11:16.570
you're interacting with comedians after the show and there's just,

181
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.860
or the fact that we were laying on the flight and then you brought me a pillow

182
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.680
or you moved a little,
no you didn't.
Brandy brought my pillow,

183
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.790
but you move the little snacks that were blocking my feet so that I can rest a

184
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:32.620
little bit.
And this is just a nice guy.
Oh,
I am,
I am a nice person.

185
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.640
I'm being a hundred percent honest right now.
I am a nice,

186
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.880
<v 2>uh,
and I,</v>

187
00:11:36.881 --> 00:11:41.730
I credit a lot of that to my mom and also probably somewhat to Catholicism,
but,

188
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.270
uh,
she drilled,
you know,
she drilled into us,

189
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:49.930
be nice and I want to make people happy,
but sometimes,
uh,

190
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.640
uh,
if I think people are taking advantage of a situation,
um,

191
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.730
<v 3>or if someone really screws me over or screws over someone I care about,</v>

192
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:05.190
I am capable of immense hatred and the hatred that lasts a lifetime as two sides

193
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:08.030
of a coin though,
right?
It's like if you're,

194
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.350
if you're able to be so nice and be so giving,

195
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.640
there's always going to be that other side of you.
I have that with me where,
um,

196
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.361
cause people are always like,

197
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.820
you're so chill and you're so relaxed and you're nice to everybody.

198
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:22.240
But I was like,
yeah,
but if you cross a certain line to me it's just,

199
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.940
I don't care.
I'm not like,
Oh,
I wish for your destruction.

200
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:26.710
I think it's just the fence.
I was like,
Oh,
you're dead to me.

201
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:31.480
You mean nothing to me.
And I,
if I cut you out,
I cut you out.
And,

202
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.460
um,
it's not,
I don't know if that's,

203
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.490
I think it's a good skill is you as it's been used useful in the past,

204
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:43.120
but um,
sometimes they have to learn now I think especially with relationships,

205
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:46.390
I learned to not be looking for reasons to cut people out.

206
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.670
We were out there on the,
are you in the dating world right now?

207
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:52.200
You have a steady girlfriend,
girlfriend.
She's going to be coming to Wa.

208
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.730
That's on the second part of this trip.
She's excited.

209
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.490
So I'll get to know her a little bit.
Yeah.
She loves you a lot.

210
00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:01.360
Should I a question her about a lot of things.
Find out about her,

211
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.230
if anything,
a tempter to be like,
Hey,

212
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.660
leave Ron and come be with me and my [inaudible]

213
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.890
<v 5>you want me to do that?
To test her</v>

214
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.220
<v 3>test her resolve.
You know,</v>

215
00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:18.810
the problem is I'm not the sexiest guy to dangle in front of me.

216
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:23.160
Doesn't care much for that.
I found out I'm the sex.
Why did you say,
wait?

217
00:13:23.161 --> 00:13:26.200
Why did you just agree with what I put out?
Yeah.
No,
I do agree.
Yeah.

218
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.330
<v 5>You had such an opportunity,
you had an opportunity to go like Conan.
No,</v>

219
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.500
but you just,
you,
you,
you said no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

220
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.730
She doesn't care about that will be fun.

221
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.390
<v 3>Are a non just muscle similar to myself.</v>

222
00:13:41.391 --> 00:13:44.840
You are a nontraditional good looking man.

223
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:49.010
As in like if you were to ask people what were the features that most people

224
00:13:49.011 --> 00:13:50.120
want and a man you,

225
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.020
<v 5>I really have.
No,</v>

226
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.280
that's great.
I could not agree with you more

227
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.840
<v 3>fudge mixed together when people were just the kind of like,</v>

228
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.390
it's like a Picasso where you're like,
it's,
it looks,

229
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.320
it's what is supposed to look.
So you're thinking,

230
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:17.380
God,
what's just say that there was a god,
you know,
the,

231
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.190
it created me and he just said like,
Eh,

232
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:26.180
it's supposed to look like that.
And then he moved on to like Ryan Gosling.
Right?

233
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:31.780
More like he was like,
uh,
I want to be able to keep an eye on this one,

234
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:33.330
so I'm going to make sure I could see them from far.

235
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.630
Okay.
You're very honest.
That's the other thing I noticed about,
oh,

236
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:45.550
because of the car,
the guitar thing.
Oh God,
that killed me.
Uh,
we were,
uh,
we were,

237
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.270
I'll just tell people that are listening to us on tour.

238
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.340
Just last week with Ron and one

239
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.590
<v 2>of the other comics,
uh,
James Beach,</v>

240
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.600
he got a new guitar and he was very excited about it and acoustic guitar and he

241
00:14:59.601 --> 00:15:01.280
was backstage and I have an acoustic guitar.

242
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:04.250
I always have a guitar around just cause it calms me down.

243
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:09.550
So we tuned up together just to test out his guitar and we just both started

244
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:12.380
playing something.
We were wandering.
The next thing I know we were,

245
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.560
I think we were in a dressing room and you were in there and you were suddenly

246
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:20.561
confronted by these two incredibly Pale white guys with acoustic guitars,

247
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.520
singing,
focusing music,
not my first time.

248
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.470
<v 5>Okay.</v>

249
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:33.450
<v 2>I immediately,
to my credit,
saw the look on your face and knew,
oh,</v>

250
00:15:33.451 --> 00:15:35.280
we gotta get the fuck out of here.
So I left,

251
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.110
I think James stuck around a little bit,

252
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:43.070
but you then proceeded to go out on stage and talk about it to the audience.

253
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.400
And it was hilarious.
I thought it was really funny.

254
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.530
<v 3>Yeah,
it was really fun.
I mean it just,</v>

255
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.710
and it was a fun experience because it was just me and Taylor Tomlinson.

256
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.880
I'm backstage before you got back there and James let's just there with his new

257
00:15:56.881 --> 00:16:01.881
guitar and he was tuning it up and he was asking requests and Taylor was trying

258
00:16:02.311 --> 00:16:05.160
to be sweet and so she was just like,
oh,
I can't think of she,

259
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.780
she also was not having fun and so she was just trying to be sweet and she was

260
00:16:09.781 --> 00:16:11.900
like,
I can't think of anything.
And he was like,
Ryan,
you got any request?

261
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.060
I just go,
ah,
you're good at this.
But to be honest,

262
00:16:15.061 --> 00:16:16.560
this just makes me uncomfortable.

263
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.690
<v 2>Yeah,
I would do.
Um,</v>

264
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.100
I remember when our head writer Mike Sweeney,
who,
you know,
uh,

265
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.700
Mike's Mike Sweetie years and go on the late night show,

266
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:36.230
it was his first day at work and he was about to leave for the day and I stepped

267
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:41.231
up to him with an acoustic guitar and started singing in his face and he said he

268
00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:45.320
didn't know me well enough to know that I was doing it in a joking way to be

269
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:47.990
annoying.
He was horrified

270
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.760
because there is nothing you can do in that situation when you're confronted by

271
00:16:53.761 --> 00:16:58.120
people playing their instrument,
even if they're really good,
you're,

272
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.090
and if you're a comedian,
you can't sit there and go like,
yeah man,

273
00:17:03.091 --> 00:17:04.080
that's really good.

274
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.810
<v 3>Yeah,
it's placed you in a bad position because you,</v>

275
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.700
especially if you don't know the person,
you can just tune everything out.

276
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:11.680
But if you know them at all,

277
00:17:11.681 --> 00:17:16.510
it's becomes like they're your three year old and you have to sit there and be

278
00:17:16.511 --> 00:17:18.220
like,
yeah,
yeah.

279
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:23.550
Well you said a really funny thing on stage I,
yeah.
Comfortable writing it.

280
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.530
I'm always comfortable tell people what you said.

281
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:29.020
You went on stage and you described,
oh,

282
00:17:29.021 --> 00:17:34.021
said that you force us to listen to you play guitar in the dressing room 30

283
00:17:34.571 --> 00:17:38.650
minutes before the show.
And that I don't fully understand,

284
00:17:38.651 --> 00:17:42.490
but now I get the gist of the women who had the deal with Louis C K women

285
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.300
<v 5>the corner and be like,</v>

286
00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:52.953
<v 3>yeah,</v>

287
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.880
audience really thought that was funny.

288
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.120
I laughed and went back to the agent Brooke,
my guitar and half,
you know,

289
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.910
who really liked it,
was there all the staff on the plane

290
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.200
and they're like,
good.
Finally,

291
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.460
uh,
let's talk about you.

292
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.090
Very inspiring part of your life is that how long ago?

293
00:18:24.091 --> 00:18:27.240
About a year and a half ago.
Two years ago.
You just,
you lost,

294
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:30.850
you decided I'm going to,
I'm going to lose weight.
So coming up,

295
00:18:30.851 --> 00:18:34.390
I be almost three years now.
Almost three years now.
Um,

296
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.070
it was around Thanksgiving three years ago.
Yeah.
When I was at my heaviest,

297
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.860
I was at like three,
360 pounds and,
and you know,

298
00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.480
I always been a heavy person and floating around 300.
Um,

299
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.300
and then when I got a on undateable and got some money,
I was,

300
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.680
had a lot more options.
And so I was able to be used to be like,
all right,

301
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:58.730
cheesecake for lunch and cheese steak for dinner and just ballooned up and put

302
00:18:59.991 --> 00:19:02.380
it on another 50 pounds and was up to three 16.

303
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.160
And that's when we talked on the plane about how my mom was just,

304
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.880
she came to visit me and she was like,
I don't like buying new clothes this big.

305
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:11.340
And then Bill Lawrence on the show was like,
Hey,

306
00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:15.300
I noticed you in the gym the first season and then you come back second season

307
00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:19.770
and then look like it stuck.
Uh,
so if you,
if you're want to,

308
00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:22.790
if you want more tools about this and you need help,
um,

309
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.570
oh it hook you up with my trainer.

310
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:28.140
And then bill paid for the trainer for the first year and,
and,

311
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.920
and just supported me and it was really,
he's a nice guy.
He's a very nice guy.

312
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.700
I really liked it because,
you know,
the character on the show was when,

313
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.270
when I got the role with like he's the overweight like shy guy and they,

314
00:19:40.271 --> 00:19:42.600
and he was just like,
look,
you're finding like we don't,

315
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.370
we don't need you to be this guy.
You can,

316
00:19:45.371 --> 00:19:48.660
you just be yourself and be healthy and that will be fine.

317
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.370
And so you lost all this weight and you said,
you said you're still,

318
00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:57.540
um,
I should probably point out to people you're drinking a glass of gravy.

319
00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:09.360
Never saw he didn't know if it came in cans.
Yeah.

320
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.520
It was a step above eggnog.
No,
cause I,
you know,
I,
I,

321
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.630
it's funny because you said that you're still getting used to your new body.

322
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:23.160
Oh yeah.
You told me it's set up straight.
Yeah.
I,
I'm very,
uh,

323
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.160
I'm always giving my son telling him like,
come on your posture and I,

324
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.750
I saw you like slumped over at one point and I,

325
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.640
and I just was kidding around and I was like,
come on and sit up straight you.

326
00:20:32.641 --> 00:20:36.570
And you said,
well,
I'm getting used to my new body.
And I thought,
Oh shit,
no,

327
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.300
I just,
cause I again,
I was like,
Oh yeah,
thank you.

328
00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:43.110
Because this is just the true for like,

329
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.020
I mean it was one of the reasons why I started going to wrestling school for a

330
00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:46.741
little bit when,

331
00:20:46.741 --> 00:20:50.140
so that I could throw my body around and figuring out where it ends and begins.

332
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.180
And,
um,
even now,

333
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:55.540
like when I go to workout and I'm doing set ups and my trainer goes to pick me

334
00:20:55.541 --> 00:21:00.100
up,
I like reach back and like,
you know,
try to brace myself as if I'm heavier.

335
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:04.240
Like I can't get up.
And he's like,
and he'll stop me.
He'll go like,
just get up.

336
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.630
You can get up.
You're,
you're not that heavy.
Just get up.

337
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.000
And I have to remember that.
And you've,
uh,

338
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:13.660
you've found it to be advantageous and your sex life.
Yeah.
Yeah.

339
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:15.040
I can pick people up.

340
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.810
I can go longer and as fun.
Um,
and I mean,
but what's great people up?

341
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.120
Don't pick people at,
Oh,
I mean,
what are you talking about?

342
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.030
You've got to have stronger arm.
No,
it's not because I can't,

343
00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:30.130
I wouldn't know what to do.
What does that mean?
Pick them up,
pick,

344
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:35.080
come up and carry him and place them on yourself?
Oh yeah.
I would.

345
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.440
I was never occurred to me to do that.
Well,
I mean,

346
00:21:38.441 --> 00:21:42.730
I was feeling adventurous for sure.
It didn't last long and then put her down,

347
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:45.570
but she was very excited about the time.
She likes to cheat.

348
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:50.470
You could pick it up and you said that if you're having sex standing up.

349
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.340
Yeah.
That's a big thing too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's my main,
picked her up.
Oh,

350
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:56.530
you picked her up and then you're acting out.
Okay.

351
00:21:56.531 --> 00:21:58.710
I'm not even sure me of the status.

352
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.630
Can you pick me up and show me exactly.

353
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.130
I would need for that to happen.

354
00:22:06.131 --> 00:22:09.400
I would need a series of pulleys and

355
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:15.580
I was feeling brave and I happened.
Wow.

356
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.210
That's like you were in the moment of just raw passion and power.
You know,

357
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.290
such a powerful tool you have is your voice.

358
00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.890
Your Voice is so disarming.
You're so likable.

359
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.240
You are one of the most likable performers that I've encountered,

360
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.830
which is why I was so happy when you agreed to go on the tour with me.

361
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.850
Did you always like your voice to people?
Oh no,
of course not.

362
00:22:39.851 --> 00:22:43.150
Especially being a,
you know,
a black kid from Chicago.

363
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.410
It w w having a sweet little voice wasn't the,
you know,

364
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:51.470
wasn't ideal.
It would,
it made you a target if anything.

365
00:22:51.471 --> 00:22:54.700
And um,
a lot of people made fun of me for it.
But that's,

366
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:58.390
I mean that's one of the lessons I learned quickly was things that people make

367
00:22:58.391 --> 00:23:02.530
fun of you for and are usually the things that set you apart and the things that

368
00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:06.040
you can then use to your advantage later.
He told me this once,

369
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.020
you used to use your voice a lot,

370
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.520
you had a job working for a bank and people would only know you through the

371
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:15.160
phone,
isn't that right?
Yeah.
And,
and,

372
00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:18.580
and you said that your voice deceived people sometimes.

373
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.900
Sometimes they thought I was a southern lady and I would just play it out.

374
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.980
You would not disabuse them of that notion.

375
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:30.220
You would let them believe that you were a southern lady.
Cause you know,

376
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:33.750
I be like,
hi,
I'm Ron.
But eventually they just hear Rhonda and Mel.

377
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.010
Thank you Rhonda.
You're so saw.
I'm like,
oh no worries.

378
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.130
Yeah,
you were also very,
you talked about this on my show,
but you were

379
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.040
<v 2>very,
uh,
you real human being.</v>

380
00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:51.520
You wanted to be a human being on the other end of the phone when you

381
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.580
represented a bank,

382
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.980
you didn't want to just be a robot who couldn't help people to be a human being.

383
00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:02.050
<v 3>Yeah,
I like to give money back.
Um,
I just never really liked banks that much.</v>

384
00:24:02.051 --> 00:24:04.810
They seem very predatory from the outside in.

385
00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.950
And then when I was working at this bank I was like,
okay,
definitely predatory.

386
00:24:08.951 --> 00:24:13.600
But just from the way they structure the fees and available balance compared to

387
00:24:13.601 --> 00:24:16.210
your actual balance and it's just,
it came,

388
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:20.050
became hard to like listen to people on the phone and just be like,

389
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.060
and they were explaining to you,
it's like,
look,

390
00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:27.061
I overdrew by a dollar and you guys charge me like $150 in fees and I'm singing

391
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.150
the math and I'm seeing they're correct and I'm supposed to just,
you know,

392
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.950
lie to them and be like,
well,
you did this.
You didn't,
you didn't know about this.

393
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.320
And I'd been,
should I just went,
Nah,
I'm just giving him,
it's not my money.

394
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.050
I'm just gonna give it back until they fire me.

395
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:46.170
<v 2>So you kept giving back money when you weren't supposed to and um,</v>

396
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.820
making the customer on the phone happy.

397
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.250
What point did the bank find out what you were doing?

398
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:57.130
<v 3>Um,
about like six months.
They usually have like little,
um,</v>

399
00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.090
they go over your scores and things.

400
00:24:59.091 --> 00:25:03.620
And so what they would find is that I have like the highest survey call scores

401
00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:06.380
because people like that I give them money back and that I was a southern lady

402
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.800
and then I'd also have the highest amount of money given back.

403
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.670
So they would try to,
you know,
they're just try to teach me not to do it.

404
00:25:16.671 --> 00:25:21.230
And I'd be like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
I'll work at it.
And I just get more.
I mean,

405
00:25:21.231 --> 00:25:23.120
mostly I just stopped showing up to work because I was,

406
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:26.780
that's when I started doing standup was working at that bank.
They,

407
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:31.130
because I was so good at the coal part of it,
they,
um,

408
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.640
let me make like a little funny video about helping other people deal with

409
00:25:34.641 --> 00:25:35.600
stress at the job.

410
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.830
And they took me off the phone for a couple of weeks and I made this fun video

411
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.740
that was just really corporatey but with dumb little corporate jokes.

412
00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:44.810
And then they showed it at the corporate retreat.

413
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:49.811
And so I got to here like 400 people just laughing at these dumb jokes and,

414
00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.830
and then in my hand and he was like,
oh,

415
00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:54.080
they're laughing at things I don't think are funny.

416
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:59.310
What if I did things that I thought were funny.
And so it,

417
00:25:59.311 --> 00:26:02.420
from then on I was like,
okay,
I'm a,
I want to do comedy.
And then they were like,

418
00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:06.900
go back on the phones and I was like,
no.
So I just go,
yeah.
So,

419
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.140
but I had my son and so I just,

420
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.230
I just stopped showing up and kept getting paychecks for a few weeks until that,

421
00:26:15.231 --> 00:26:18.290
until they fire me.
It was pretty sweet.
Yeah.

422
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.180
So the comedy worked out pretty quickly.

423
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.500
It worked out quicker than most.
I have to always remember that,

424
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:27.740
especially around my friends.
Um,
I'd say about six,

425
00:26:27.741 --> 00:26:32.330
six years was when I probably started getting some money and cause I was like

426
00:26:32.331 --> 00:26:35.750
right around when I got on your show and,
but before then there was,

427
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.330
I mean there was five years of me raising my son and um,

428
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:44.010
he has autism and so we had a lot of like his like social security

429
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:49.010
<v 2>money and then I was working on a part time job as a little lady liberty dancer,</v>

430
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.500
but like dirt,
no real money.
We were living like,
you know,

431
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.450
under and definitely like under 1500 a month,
you know,

432
00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.260
for a few years.
And so that was,
I mean that's why I spoil him now.

433
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.120
Here's the Fun Dad.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
He is any video game he wants.

434
00:27:06.121 --> 00:27:10.830
He has four multiple systems he is seeing and you bake,
you bake cookies for him.

435
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:14.730
Yeah,
I blood cooking for my girlfriends.
Started baking cookies for him.
She,

436
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:18.690
she's trying to earn his trust.
That's sweet.
Yeah.
That's really nice.

437
00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:22.290
And that's also a good test for you.
You wanted me to test this girlfriend,

438
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:26.430
but if she's making cookies for your son.
Yeah.
She's already passed that test.

439
00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:29.810
Yeah,
no,
I trust her.
I will try to sleep with her place.

440
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.870
She'll get a thrill out of,
I will say,
listen,

441
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:38.850
I may be an unconventional assembly of odd features.

442
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:42.630
I may be a Picasso ask mass,

443
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.090
but I am going to bed you

444
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.920
and there's little that you can't escape the charm of these thin lips.

445
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:54.280
<v 3>Okay.</v>

446
00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.680
<v 2>BDIS translucent skin.</v>

447
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:02.130
<v 3>Good though.
Actually.
I mean I see this when you on this suit it up your fun,</v>

448
00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:07.131
but casual Kona is a pretty hot and I see what I can see it.

449
00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:10.650
I can see people once they carry and that guitar around.

450
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.473
<v 4>Oh</v>

451
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.180
<v 1>now it's time for a segment.</v>

452
00:28:21.181 --> 00:28:23.910
Conan O'brien pays off the mortgage on his beach house.

453
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.010
<v 2>Pay Them bills,
dollar bill dollar bill,</v>

454
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.533
<v 6>Mike,</v>

455
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.860
<v 3>Bill Dolla bill.
That's how it was.</v>

456
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.200
I'm just talking the way that kids talk these days and you think I don't get out

457
00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:44.034
much.

458
00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:55.640
<v 1>I've been excited about many of the products we've discussed here on the show,</v>

459
00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.070
but I honestly have to say butcher box.

460
00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.220
That's a company that I understand.

461
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.620
You know why they send you meet.

462
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.310
We've talked about some esoteric websites here,
have we not?

463
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.450
And it gets a little confusing sometimes and then sometimes you might think this

464
00:29:11.451 --> 00:29:13.790
Conan,
really nobody's talking about,
guess what?

465
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
I'm on solid ground right now cause butcher box delivers grass fed grass

466
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.700
finished beef,
organic chicken,
pork,

467
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.690
wild Alaskan Salmon.
This is good stuff.

468
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.940
Any company that sends me great protein through the mail,
Bang,

469
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:39.980
I'm there.
I get it.
I understand it.
It's exciting.
It is exciting.

470
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:44.290
It's a lot of fun.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I'm like this.

471
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:46.530
Today is a lot of fun.
I'm sorry.
I don't,

472
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.380
you're going to get sued by Aubrey Plaza.
I don't know what I'm doing.

473
00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:54.600
Stealing her whole bit.
I'm such an excited person.
But listen,

474
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.690
you love,
you love yourself.
You're dead.
You're dead.

475
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:02.720
To which is the Greek term for,
for grandfather.
Is it Greek?
What's Shit?

476
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:07.600
That's Armenio.
I don't,
I think so.
Anyway.
You're always say,
oh my dad,
my dad,

477
00:30:07.601 --> 00:30:10.260
dad was a butcher.
My debt was a butcher,
my dead,
it was a butcher.

478
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:14.200
That's all she says.
You're your Delta devoted his whole life to meet.

479
00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:17.050
And how there's butcher box.
They would have loved this.
Yeah.

480
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:21.640
You can choose from a variety of curated boxes or you can customize your own
box.

481
00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.980
Amit.
That's incredible.

482
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:28.090
Each box comes with at least nine to 11 pounds of meat,
which is enough for,

483
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.890
it says here,
24 individual size meals.
Not In my family,

484
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.930
man.
Where did they,
yes.
And that to the O'bryan house in Brookline,
mass.

485
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:39.880
Here's nine to 11 pounds of meat.

486
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.080
That should take care of 24 people and Nope,

487
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.460
it took care of one.
It's ridiculous.

488
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.670
We Chow down in my family anyway,

489
00:30:51.671 --> 00:30:56.671
it's all just $129 a month that works out to less than $6 a meal.

490
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.070
You know,
me,
Sona,
I likes me,
my protein.
Uh,

491
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.820
yeah.
I wonder why we're both Popeye in this scenario.
I got,
got,
got,
got,
got,
got,

492
00:31:06.821 --> 00:31:11.680
got.
I likes me mean protein,
but I do,
I really do love,
uh,
this,

493
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:16.480
this whole concept and the website,
uh,
breaks it all down for you.

494
00:31:16.481 --> 00:31:20.620
So you know,
all the different qualities of meat educates you.
It's pretty cool.

495
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:26.070
New Subscribers get $20 off your first box and two pounds of free salmon.

496
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:33.060
When you go to butcher box.com/conan that's butcher box.com/conan for $20 off

497
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:38.560
your first box and two pounds of free salmon.
You know what,

498
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:42.400
where my mind goes right now I picture a bear getting on a website.

499
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:48.310
It's paused working to keys and ordering some salmon rather than going to the

500
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.510
waterfall and having to catch one weird and is it jumps up,
you know what I mean?

501
00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:55.360
Can you just see a bear trying to catch salmon jumping up the river and it's

502
00:31:55.361 --> 00:31:56.230
having a hard time.

503
00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.560
If I directed an ad for butcher box and we'd be a bear frustrated missing the

504
00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:02.470
salmon,

505
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:07.150
then shrugging and you see the bear walking to its cave and then it gets on the

506
00:32:07.151 --> 00:32:10.570
computer and it goes on butcher box and it ordered salmon and salmon is probably

507
00:32:10.571 --> 00:32:14.140
would not be a fun and I like that Ad.
Well I missed my calling.

508
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:18.610
I could have been a mid level advertising EXEC,
but no,

509
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:23.560
I chose fame.
Sad.
Anyway,
that's it.
Butcher box.

510
00:32:23.561 --> 00:32:24.394
You know what to do.

511
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.400
Estonia,
as you're aware,
I'm not very good with money.
You're not terrible.

512
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.240
Well what,
what do you mean really at it?
I was just saying I'm not that great.

513
00:32:41.241 --> 00:32:42.320
Why are you going that far?

514
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.800
But we have a whole segment dedicated to you paying off your beach house cause

515
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:48.080
you made a lot of bad financial decisions.

516
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.400
So I guess that's true point.
Yeah.
I,

517
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:57.050
I'm often confused by finance.
I've made some pretty bad investments.

518
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.120
I've invested in a lot of theme restaurants that had really bad themes.

519
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.680
Like what there was that a French fry restaurant that was based on the potato

520
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:08.990
famine and uh,
that

521
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.900
we put 17 of those in the valley and they all went belly up pretty quickly.

522
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.590
I apologize for that.
So I need help.
I need help investing.

523
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:22.640
And that's where Robin Hood comes in.
No,
I'm not talking about that.

524
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.710
Legendary Archer in the woods.

525
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.330
That laugh was too long.

526
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:34.550
Robin Hood is an investing app that lets you buy and sell stocks,
ETFs,

527
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:39.470
options,
cryptos and guess what?
It's all commission free.
And guess what?

528
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.880
I don't know what ETFs in Cryptos are,
but the point is,

529
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.740
if you're like me,
a stock market newcomer,
uh,
this is a,

530
00:33:48.741 --> 00:33:52.700
an app that really explains things for you.
It makes it pretty easy.
You know,

531
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:57.600
other brokerages charge up to $10 for every trade.
Can you imagine that?
Yes.

532
00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:01.460
Really Nice.
Too Much
God.

533
00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:06.410
It's the worst performance.
It is too much.

534
00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:10.520
I'm not going to pay this pay $10 every time I make a trade.

535
00:34:10.521 --> 00:34:15.440
That's ridiculous.
Robin Hood doesn't charge commissions.
Absolutely incredible.

536
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.370
And they have this really easy to understand chart.

537
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:23.510
They have market data that even I can understand.
Can you imagine that?

538
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.070
That's amazing.
Yeah.

539
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.820
And you can trade on your smartphone and just four taps.

540
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.350
I that might not be good for me.
I would make bad decisions because if my,

541
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:38.150
if I could just do it on my phone,
I'm going to be much more likely to,

542
00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:42.320
uh,
you know,
invest in a company that makes you know,

543
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:46.220
helmets for orangutans or something.
So,
um,
but anyway,

544
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:51.140
most people,
we don't want them getting apes grape,
ape scrape.
Yeah.

545
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.810
That's all right,
Matt.
You've heard of apes,
apes grape.

546
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:58.700
Keep your ape safe with apes,
grape,
ape swinging the jungle all the time.

547
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:03.710
But they do suffer a head injuries,
orangutans,

548
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:09.320
chimpanzees,
so get them a helmet with apes.
Great.
We just made that up.

549
00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.780
But if someone wants to make that company a,

550
00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:13.940
I'll do the ad for it for free anyway.

551
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:19.450
Robin Hood is giving listeners a free stock like Apple Ford or sprint sign up at

552
00:35:20.301 --> 00:35:24.800
Conan dot.
Robin hood.com.
That's Conan doc Robin,
hood.com.

553
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.640
And if you're interested in a helmet for your eight Matt Gorley and I was

554
00:35:28.641 --> 00:35:31.190
turning a new company called Ayp scrape,

555
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.030
you are,

556
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.510
<v 3>uh,
someone who</v>

557
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:44.320
<v 2>likes to enjoy life.
And for you that does mean video games.</v>

558
00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.630
You love video games.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

559
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.510
<v 3>absolutely.
You love marijuana.
I do.</v>

560
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.330
I may be the last person alive that calls it marijuana.

561
00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:59.560
I try to balance it out though.
I don't like to feel,
um,

562
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:04.950
a compromise as my trainer will say anytime I'm not doing well on my exercises.

563
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:09.910
Um,
and just try,
keep a balance
but half fun.

564
00:36:09.911 --> 00:36:14.710
And once I realize again that my job is to have fun and make people have fun.

565
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.140
Then I was like,
Oh hey,
good to do this.

566
00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:21.640
I get to just smoke pot and play video games because I'm supposed to be having

567
00:36:21.641 --> 00:36:22.240
fun.

568
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:27.240
I'm supposed to be adjuster and why would I go around acting serious or try to

569
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:29.380
be in?

570
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.440
I think as a trap of when you get a little bit of success is then you're like,

571
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:32.630
oh,

572
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:37.420
now I need to buckle down and be real professional because that's what they want

573
00:36:37.421 --> 00:36:38.100
and it's just like,
no,

574
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.530
they would you want it is what you were in the very beginning.

575
00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:42.700
I've had people tell them

576
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.640
<v 2>that it would be good for me to smoke pot or</v>

577
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:53.190
because I'm seeing tightly wound to them and I've had a number of people over

578
00:36:53.831 --> 00:36:58.831
the years say it would be good if you took edibles or smoked pot if you did some

579
00:36:59.381 --> 00:36:59.860
of that.

580
00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.790
Is that something since we are now friends and the fact that you're on this

581
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.900
podcast means that we are friends.
Yeah.
You know this is you've,
you've made it.

582
00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:12.430
This is a huge deal.
I like for you.
What do you think?

583
00:37:12.431 --> 00:37:15.200
Be honest with me.
Do you,
do you think I need to be a little medicated?

584
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.340
<v 3>Wait,
no.
Um,
I'm not always,</v>

585
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.270
I'm never a guy who like pushes people into smoking a bunch of pot if they don't

586
00:37:22.271 --> 00:37:24.810
want to.
It seems like you're too old to start.
Uh,

587
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.170
36 years old,

588
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.640
although my mom has recently started it and she is loving it.
Um,

589
00:37:33.641 --> 00:37:37.660
so it can be helpful.
But you know,
how old is your mom?
My mom is 62.
Okay.

590
00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.960
So I'm a,
I'm good deal younger than your mom.
Yeah.
Okay.

591
00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.780
But I don't want you to put me in the mom category.
Yeah,
that's true.

592
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.770
So you think I'm to a match,
going to count it up.
Your personality,

593
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:52.420
I think to change that and mellow you out,
it would be to Dole.
What,

594
00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.890
um,
what makes you you.
And if you want to do it just for fun,

595
00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.880
I would love to smoke pot with you.
That would be a dream come true.
But,

596
00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.600
and also so Phonto videotape.
Uh,
but can you do it?

597
00:38:04.601 --> 00:38:06.850
Should we do it on the next leg of the tour?
Yeah,
for sure.

598
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:09.760
Did we smoke it or do we eat something?
How does it work?

599
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:14.250
I don't even know how I'm going to do both.
But whatever you decide for yourself.

600
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.530
I don't think starting with edibles is a good idea.
Too Strong,

601
00:38:17.531 --> 00:38:20.680
too strong and you don't know what you're doing and getting into,

602
00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:25.970
I had rather I would rather set up a fun evening for you where it's like,

603
00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:29.460
okay,
we'll get your guitar out and we'll get,
I dunno know

604
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:35.080
guitar is not part of this equation.
We're not,
I'm never,

605
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:40.130
you are never going to see me with a guitar.
Yeah.
After you compare it need to,

606
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.330
do you know what you did?
I am never doing that again,
man.
Moses,

607
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.330
that is not how I mastered it.

608
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.240
Mine is more like playing a cello.
I masturbate.

609
00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:59.420
But um,
why do you want to,
do you want to?
I don't know.
I've mixed.
I,

610
00:38:59.421 --> 00:39:03.790
I usually don't want to,
I usually don't watch because I,

611
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:06.280
she'll like,
uh,

612
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:11.820
I overall like who I am and if I want to take the edge off,

613
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:17.290
to me that's two glasses of wine.
That's my kind of thing.

614
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.010
Whereas opposed to,
I don't know what you call him,
jazz cigarettes,

615
00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.600
Wacky Tobacky,
you know,
uh,
I don't know what your kids call it these days.

616
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:30.220
Devil's lettuce.
I don't know.
I think,
uh,

617
00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.320
I don't think that's a good fit for me.
You know?

618
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.640
And I think you got to know who you are.
I can't drink.

619
00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:41.140
I'm allergic to alcohol.
It makes me projectile vomit and my throat close up.

620
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:45.010
Is that true?
Yeah.
So I can,
so for me it was just like,

621
00:39:45.011 --> 00:39:48.160
that's not what you find that out.
18.
Oh my God.

622
00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:52.100
You took one drink and your throat closed up and you did,
you almost die.

623
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.400
I laid down at a party and I just waited for it to pass.

624
00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.980
And then my friends were like,
maybe it was what you drank,

625
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:03.640
so let's try something different.
And then it happened again.
And so I was like,

626
00:40:03.641 --> 00:40:06.880
okay,
let's just do this,
just isn't for me.
And then they said,
nope,

627
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:10.420
we've got to go through every type of [inaudible].
They were like,
yes,

628
00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:14.710
because that's how your friends that aren't,
we're not done with you yet.

629
00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.220
But I was like,
and for me,
I'd always had an interest in pot and I'm like,

630
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.370
I talked to my son about it and he has no interest in it.
You know,
he's,

631
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.010
he has more interest in beer.
Just something he always liked it.

632
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:29.730
We go to baseball games and he just always here the guy and he just yelled at

633
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.400
Alli ice cold beer.
And so now as he's older,
he's,

634
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:38.170
we've talked and he's just like,
he's,
the things we need is for old people.

635
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.550
He wants to drink beer.
Oh,
when he gets older,
how old is he now?
He's six.

636
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.040
He's 15.
15.
Okay.
So he's gotta he's gotta wait a little while.
Yeah,

637
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.150
I'm going to see where Irish,
he had been drinking in utero.

638
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:58.480
Um,
but I'm not like Tommy Chong or anything.
He was like,
everybody's just moves.

639
00:40:58.481 --> 00:41:00.490
We'd everybody,
I saw him at a show and he's like,

640
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.410
everybody in the world's just smoke weed.
And I was,

641
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.600
and I just leaned over and was like,
even babies,

642
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.360
there's a whole school out there,
which is like,
it's,

643
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:12.340
it's natural and it cures all ills and the world would be a better place if

644
00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:14.330
everyone was high.
And I think no it wasn't,
you know,

645
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.930
we'd just be taking longer pauses in our sentences.

646
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.990
Nothing would work very little.
I would get done.
And that's just,

647
00:41:22.991 --> 00:41:25.900
to me that's the same type of mindset where people have on anything where

648
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:28.960
they're like,
there's one thing,
if this was different,

649
00:41:28.961 --> 00:41:32.110
the world would be different.
Or if like if women ruled the world,

650
00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:35.450
everything would be different.
It's just like every power corrupts,
you know,

651
00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:39.530
so it's not like,
Oh,
if women were on power,
you,
you,

652
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.840
everyone would be nice or some things would be nicer.

653
00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:46.070
And some women would be assholes and just like some guys are nice and some guys

654
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:48.590
when they get power button atheletes yeah,

655
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.630
<v 2>I liked it.
Part of your philosophy of life is get pedicures,
get manicures.
Yes.</v>

656
00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:58.430
Yes.
You have to take care of yourself?
Yeah,
I get very self conscious.

657
00:41:58.431 --> 00:42:01.240
I have messed up toes.
Um,

658
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.520
meaning the toenails grow into the sides and it really hurts.

659
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:08.060
And I finally had to go and see someone and they,
they said,

660
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:13.061
you've got to get pedicures and I'm incredibly uncomfortable having someone,

661
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:17.090
it's,
it feels wrong.
Do you know what I mean?
It feels like,

662
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.060
and so I'm constantly trying to make it up to them by asking them all about

663
00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:22.970
their life.
Oh,
that seems worse.
And then,
yeah,

664
00:42:22.971 --> 00:42:27.620
I know they just want me to shut the fuck up.
Um,
but I want to,

665
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:28.280
you know,

666
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.330
I want to become their best friend because I want to compensate for the fact

667
00:42:32.331 --> 00:42:36.710
that they're literally kneeling in front of me.
Oh,
caring,
caring for my feet.

668
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:38.430
<v 3>You like that I like,
I'm like,</v>

669
00:42:38.431 --> 00:42:43.431
don't look me in the eyes and bring me a drink and just take care of my feet and

670
00:42:43.591 --> 00:42:47.640
then I'll pay you a great amount.
It makes me feel like a king.
You would drink.

671
00:42:47.641 --> 00:42:49.920
Where are you getting your toes done and they bring you a drink?

672
00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.890
What kind of drink?
I mean you wherever you want my place.

673
00:42:52.891 --> 00:42:55.630
But I mean I just drink like a sparkling water,
but if you want it like a,

674
00:42:55.631 --> 00:43:00.280
a glass of whiskey or whatever.
You're kidding.
Where is this place?
Uh,

675
00:43:00.281 --> 00:43:04.200
yes.
Well I have a mango now named Natasha and she's,

676
00:43:04.201 --> 00:43:09.120
she's private and that's who I want to promote.
That's got the word on it.

677
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.660
But,
but I love this idea that they bring you a drink.
Yeah.

678
00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.930
Natasha bring you a drink or comes to your house.
She brings me a drink.

679
00:43:15.931 --> 00:43:17.670
She has her own private place.
Uh,

680
00:43:17.671 --> 00:43:20.880
but I used to love this place called hammer and nails and they um,

681
00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:21.720
they bring you,

682
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.710
it's all for men only and they would bring you a drink and can go on there.

683
00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.440
I want to actually do an ad for them right now.
Hammer and nails.
Yeah,

684
00:43:28.441 --> 00:43:29.580
I think they changed their name.

685
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:33.480
<v 2>Oh,
well that didn't work.
No.
Some ad that was,
yeah,</v>

686
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.060
that had was worth at least $15,000

687
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.240
<v 3>place.
It's probably close.</v>

688
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.940
Maybe they just became a bar now and they don't even do feet

689
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:50.550
drinks now.
You know what,
we're doing really well on the drinks.

690
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:55.230
Uh,
Ooh.
I figured out this,
I know we gotta wrap up,

691
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.780
but I'm aware,
I didn't know if,

692
00:43:57.781 --> 00:44:02.250
are you aware that that most older black women call you Kona?

693
00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.680
Are you aware of that?
Yes.
That's fine.

694
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:06.860
<v 2>Yeah.
That's so fun.
Um,</v>

695
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.900
I remembered I was walking down the street in New York and a very large black

696
00:44:13.111 --> 00:44:18.111
woman was walking the other way towards me and she saw me and she hit her friend

697
00:44:18.691 --> 00:44:22.970
on the arm and she said,
that's Conan Orion from the,

698
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.900
<v 3>I said she got so many things wrong in such a short sentence.</v>

699
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:33.720
You know what I mean?
That's going in Orion from the radio,

700
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:37.140
from the radio,
Orion,
Conan.

701
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:43.300
<v 2>You mathematically can't be more wrong about me in a sentence.
But uh,</v>

702
00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.440
you know what I,
I hear a lot African Americans are always saying,

703
00:44:47.441 --> 00:44:51.670
you're crazy to me.
They think I'm crazy.
They laugh and they,
they,

704
00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.420
they're happy.
See me,
but they say you're crazy.

705
00:44:55.470 --> 00:45:00.310
<v 3>Yeah,
you do.
Like comedy is supposed to be,
yeah.
I think,</v>

706
00:45:00.311 --> 00:45:03.570
fool.
You're a fool.
I'm a fool.
I am crazy.
Oh,

707
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:09.240
that guy is crazy.
Yeah,
the high compliment.
Oh,
that's good.
That's good.

708
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:14.170
I then,
um,
mine's usually reversed.
One time I did this show and,
uh,

709
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:18.540
Washington and was staying with some friends and her,

710
00:45:18.541 --> 00:45:23.541
his girlfriend came to the show and then we came back to his house and then he,

711
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.990
he is a very stereotypical,
more tougher black dude.
And then he was like,
oh,

712
00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:30.210
her budget will comedy show up.
Dang.
Or her.
That's good.

713
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.630
He just met me for the first time,
but just talking to me,
he's like,
oh,
it's like,

714
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.780
you know,
you seem pretty cool.
You seem pretty funny.
And I was like,
yeah,

715
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:39.330
I'm pretty fun.
He's like,
I bet black people don't fuck with you though.

716
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:44.220
[inaudible] I go,
you pretty true.

717
00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.300
And he goes,
don't worry about it.
Black people don't fuck with most people.

718
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:56.550
It's a great insight there.
Really helped me.
That's fantastic.

719
00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.510
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
we,
uh,
we're out of time.
We've got a,</v>

720
00:46:00.511 --> 00:46:01.770
I just switched it back cause I could,

721
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.690
I knew that I could talk to for probably nine hours.

722
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.140
I probably will next week when we're flying around.
Um,

723
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.770
<v 3>yeah.
Was Fair.
Come on.
Come to my house,
come on my podcast and a comma.</v>

724
00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.880
Plug it right now.
It's called game better.

725
00:46:16.881 --> 00:46:21.860
What Ron Funches we just talk about getting better at life usually is about a

726
00:46:21.861 --> 00:46:22.730
lot about career,

727
00:46:22.731 --> 00:46:26.510
but sometimes it gets spiritual and then sometimes it's just about like,

728
00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:28.970
you know,
health,
physical change.
I'll do it

729
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:33.640
<v 2>if,
and will your mom be there?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm in.
I'm going to go,</v>

730
00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:34.533
I'm going to go,

731
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.220
I'm going to do your podcast and I'm also going to promote you as a human being.

732
00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:41.520
Uh,
Ron Funches is,
uh,

733
00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:46.620
one of the funniest comics working and he's also a delightful human.

734
00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.390
Uh,
and it's just an honor to get to hang out with you.
Uh,
it means a lot to me

735
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:55.360
<v 3>is a literal dream come true that the fact that I'm even here.</v>

736
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:56.920
So it means a lot to me.

737
00:46:57.190 --> 00:47:01.480
And the fact that you like my comedy and you respect my comedy,

738
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:05.740
um,
when I hear the compliments like that,
um,

739
00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:09.520
and the fact that you have had me on your show so much and even when I'm haven't

740
00:47:09.521 --> 00:47:13.660
had things necessarily that we're worth promoting on your show,
it makes me go,

741
00:47:13.661 --> 00:47:17.210
okay,
I'm,
I'm headed in the right direction.
Yes,
yes.

742
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.950
And I just wanted to trick you into saying Nice things about me again to wrap it

743
00:47:20.951 --> 00:47:25.420
up,
which is exactly what I just did.
All right,
Ron.
Ron Funches.

744
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:26.843
<v 4>Wow.</v>

745
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:35.420
<v 1>And now it's time for another installment of Conan O'brien pays off the mortgage</v>

746
00:47:35.421 --> 00:47:36.440
on his beach house.

747
00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:45.120
Either way.
There is a lot of photos out there that you take.

748
00:47:45.121 --> 00:47:49.560
You take tons of photos with these digital devices.
You don't use them all?
No,

749
00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:50.790
they just languish.

750
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.900
Why not focus on the moments that mean the most in your life by turning your

751
00:47:54.901 --> 00:47:59.610
favorite digital memories into meaningful photo decor?

752
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.670
That's an interesting sentence.
You know what?

753
00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:07.290
That's a sentence I just came up with.
I just said that.
Did you not like it?

754
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.850
I've never heard you say decor.
Well,
it happens to be one of my favorite words.

755
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.930
I don't think there's a day that goes by when I don't say meaningful photo
decor.

756
00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:20.790
It's the first word my daughter ever said.
She was two years old.
She went,

757
00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:25.350
meaning Paul Folk,
there's this company fracture.

758
00:48:25.351 --> 00:48:29.250
They're on a mission to redefine how you print and display your favorite photos.

759
00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.770
They print them on glass.
That's cool.

760
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:35.370
Directly on glass and you know when you give someone a photo,

761
00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:38.490
like I could give you a photo of me and you might throw it away because you

762
00:48:38.491 --> 00:48:41.220
don't like me.
If I give it to you on glass,

763
00:48:41.221 --> 00:48:44.570
you kind of have to keep it because it's so beautiful.
Yeah.

764
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.630
A fracture prints there.
It's just more thoughtful to say,
here's a,

765
00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.950
here's a picture on glass.
It's,
it makes it a more unique gift.

766
00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:56.130
They're sleek.
They're,
they have a frameless design.

767
00:48:56.370 --> 00:49:01.080
It goes with any decor.
It is nice cause it,
it prints,

768
00:49:01.081 --> 00:49:05.700
you don't need to get a frame.
It comes in the box and you just hang it right up.

769
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.930
Yep.
They're handsome.
They're made in Gainesville,
Florida.
Okay.

770
00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.570
I like any business that's in Gainesville,
Florida.

771
00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:15.030
I don't care what you're doing in Gainesville,
Florida,

772
00:49:15.031 --> 00:49:17.850
if you're making it in Gainesville,
I'm a customer.

773
00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:21.390
I'm going just going to put that out there.
Fractures a green company.

774
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.080
They have a carbon neutral factory.
That's cool.
And you know what?

775
00:49:25.081 --> 00:49:25.740
That's another thing.

776
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:30.120
I don't buy anything unless it's from a carbon neutral factory.
Just so specific.

777
00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:34.410
Well,
that's just me.
So they sent us a fracture print.
It was really pretty.

778
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.250
It was.
I just wished it had been of me.
You know,

779
00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:43.350
why don't you just order one of you?
I don't what?
Oh,
you're right.
I can do that.

780
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:47.130
That's the whole point of me doing this ad.
Anyway,

781
00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.250
a beautiful quality.
Uh,

784
00:49:58.861 --> 00:50:00.870
One question survey,

786

That's right.
Your old pal Conan and fracture me.com/conan.

787
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:14.970
Turn your memories into glass.
I just made that.

788
00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:20.430
Just made that up.
I did a pretty good turn.
Your men don't be an ass.

789
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:23.160
Turn your memories into glass.

790
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:33.560
Okay.
This is interesting.
On a previous podcast,

791
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:38.030
sona and I had an impromptu drawing contest.

792
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:43.570
We each had to draw a dog and it was around Christmas time and then left it up

793
00:50:45.531 --> 00:50:50.150
to you,
the podcast enjoyer to uh,

794
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:54.010
so what they're called podcast enjoyers podcast listeners.
It's,
it's,

795
00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:57.560
it must be a better word because you can listen to a podcast,
but no,
I know,

796
00:50:57.561 --> 00:51:02.120
but what's,
what's the word?
Is there a word pod?
What is listening?
Listener.

797
00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.370
Listener.
Podcast.
Listener.

798
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:09.140
Because we have a whole generation that crunches everything down into one

799
00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:13.040
syllable.
And you already have podcasts,
which is two syllables.

800
00:51:13.041 --> 00:51:15.410
And then you add lists center,
which is three.

801
00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:20.240
You'd think by now would it be called something?
People that consume podcasts,

802
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:24.770
what would you call potties?
You know,
hey,
you potties.

803
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.850
What's wrong with that?
Why are you laughing at that?
That is,
well,
you know,

804
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:31.160
I mean you call it a person who watches TV,

805
00:51:31.161 --> 00:51:34.370
a TV viewer or a movie watcher.

806
00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:39.230
So there's podcast listener.
It's the,
it's the thing.
And then what you do.

807
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:42.020
I just think it could be better.
Hey,
listen,
you potties.

808
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:47.840
We asked a bunch of you who had the better drawing,
who had the better drawing?

809
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.000
You voted and this is crazy.

810
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:55.150
I won a lot of you voted over 1100 people voted on this idiocy.

811
00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:02.210
That's makes me sad about America.
It does.
Uh,

812
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:06.080
but you did 1100 of you voted whose puppy?

813
00:52:06.081 --> 00:52:08.690
Dog with a Christmas bow drawing his best cast your vote.

814
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:13.340
The results are in 71% liked CONAN's doodle.

815
00:52:13.341 --> 00:52:17.660
29% thought sona had the better doodle.

816
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:22.190
You were destroyed.
That wasn't even close tests.
No,

817
00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:26.900
that is not close at all.
I had something that's supposed to be open to,

818
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:30.350
you know,
it's subjective.
Your your taste in art,

819
00:52:30.351 --> 00:52:35.330
but no overwhelming.
You are a famous person.

820
00:52:35.331 --> 00:52:37.160
I am not a famous person.
Nope.

821
00:52:37.161 --> 00:52:41.480
That's not the reason I draw a picture of mine looking out Q minus.

822
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:44.960
That's just a,
yours has dead eyes.
That's what's funny about it.

823
00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:46.880
The sea dead eyes that snoopy has,

824
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:51.020
you know that Charles Grodin has when you'd have dead eyes.

825
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:55.760
It's just funny.
And also mine has a joke.
My Dog's looking sad.

826
00:52:55.761 --> 00:52:59.660
Then he's saying I'm Jewish.
He's thinking that your dog is just,

827
00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.460
this is something you learn to draw out of a learn how to draw a puppy book.

828
00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.050
Right?
Is it not?

829
00:53:06.051 --> 00:53:11.051
In 1989 and you learned this and you've been doing it ever since mine,

830
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:16.540
this is me like Jackson Pollock or Picasso breaking through.

831
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:21.530
Effortless.
That's such a bad,
an effortless expression of creativity.

832
00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:26.390
Well,
I followed the directions.
I was told the puppy with a Christmas.
Yeah,
sure.

833
00:53:26.391 --> 00:53:30.570
A really cute one.
You.
Yeah.
Great artists follow directions.

834
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:34.500
Great artists follow directions.
Hey,
Picasso,

835
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:37.520
what's going on with those eyeballs?
They're all screwy.
See,

836
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.440
straighten those out and you'll learn more money on those paintings.
See,

837
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.820
that would have been you if you talk that way and you lived back when Picasso

838
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:48.720
was alive,
I would tell Picasso at to do his eyeballs were all screwy.

839
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:52.800
That's not how I learned.
You've got to do as you're told and art.
No,
that's not.

840
00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:57.300
That's you.
That's not me.
I am unbridled.
I cannot be tamed.

841
00:53:57.301 --> 00:54:01.530
I'm a wild stallion and artistic beast.
I am smoking,

842
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:04.470
I am fire,
I am cheese and I am Cheddar.

843
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:07.470
I need to go to the hospital.

844
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:12.780
You are comparing our doodles to works by Picasso.
Well no mine,

845
00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:16.820
you heard this.
This looks like uh,

846
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:21.480
there's a sick kid and his friend made this saying,
I hope you feel better.

847
00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:27.200
If I were sick,
I made this puppy video and talk to me.
Tell minutes how,

848
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:29.550
wow.
I'll be make it mine.

849
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:34.310
Look the potties have spoken and uh,

850
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.890
I have an overwhelming 71%.

851
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:42.930
Well that means almost one out of four people preferred mine.
Yeah.

852
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:46.680
Have you seen the statistics on one out of four potties went out of four potties

853
00:54:46.681 --> 00:54:51.030
or glue sniffing maniacs.
That's,
that's a fact.

854
00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:53.670
One out of four.
Let's go sniff some glue.

855
00:54:53.671 --> 00:54:57.120
But forest and we'll put a podcast on.
Well,
we sniff.

856
00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:03.540
Oh yeah,
that's good stuff man.
I tell it now until it like,

857
00:55:03.541 --> 00:55:04.374
it is

858
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.820
good glue that's right in there and you right to be angry.

859
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:13.380
So the people who voted for me were sniffing glue during the podcast,

860
00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:17.310
then went on Twitter while they were high on glue sniffing.

861
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.250
I think some of the ones that voted for you didn't even know that they were on

862
00:55:20.251 --> 00:55:24.120
Twitter.
I think they thought they were ordering a Domino's pizza.
No,

863
00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:25.560
they thought they were ordering a pizza.

864
00:55:25.561 --> 00:55:28.680
They got confused and then x and they voted accidentally for you.

865
00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:31.080
If I was going to be friends with one of these puppies,

866
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:33.470
I would be friends with my puppy instead of your,

867
00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:38.850
you're dead eyes puppy that has a zero fun personality to it.

868
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:42.810
It's a dumb dog.
You drew a dumb puppy when you're just assaulted.

869
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.710
72% of all parties.
I still think about that.

870
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:51.750
I won and I'm gracious and my victory.
Oh,
you're gracious,

871
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:58.710
Gracious.
You're a gracious winner.
Yes,
I am.
Just one thing you can say about me.

872
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:02.850
It's that I'm a gracious and humble winner.
It's not,

873
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:06.240
that's not something I would say about you and an incredible victory.

874
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:10.560
I think you're a terrible person.
That is your Goto line on me.

875
00:56:10.561 --> 00:56:14.190
Say any 1%.
I know.
And you know what?
It's not true.
I think you're a nice guy.

876
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:18.930
I'm a nice guy.
In real life.
I play this crusty guy.

877
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:22.260
Um,
but really I'm one of the nicest people you've ever imagined

878
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:29.360
<v 7>and we will get an editor to put something in there to make it not awkward if we</v>

879
00:56:29.641 --> 00:56:34.290
can afford that yet.
One of the nicest guys,
please.
You've met,

880
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.410
you haven't gotten outside a lot,
I think if you wanted to be evil,

881
00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:41.730
no one could touch you.
Yes.
But you choose to use your powers for good.
Yes.

882
00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:45.980
So that's a nice thing.
71% crushed you.

883
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:55.260
<v 8>Conan O'brien needs a frame with sona obsessing and Conan O'brien as himself</v>

2018 is ober not a moment too soon.

900
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:06.220
Challenging year.
However,
a real bright spot was doing whole mafia.

901
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.040
That's right.
I uh,
I love it.
I'm Dave Holmes.

902
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:14.070
I'm Matt McConkey and we had such a good time this year doing this show.

903
00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:16.600
Uh,
if you are not familiar,

904
00:58:16.601 --> 00:58:21.601
hemophilia is a podcast here at Earwolf where Matt and I talked to awesome LGBT

905
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:26.800
queer plus people,
celebrities date,
let's just say celebrities,

906
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:31.690
geniuses,
creators,
makers,
movers,
shakers,
um,
uh,

907
00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:34.540
about the pop culture that they're loving and the people that they're living.

908
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.790
We had a ton of great guests,

909
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:40.060
2018 including Jesse Tyler Ferguson.

910
00:58:40.061 --> 00:58:42.220
Maybe you've heard of him for a little show called modern family.

911
00:58:42.221 --> 00:58:47.220
He's telling us the story about the time he got caught shoplifting gay porn.
Oh,

912
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.390
all the blood rushed to my stomach.

913
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:53.290
I just felt such compassion for him.
Uh,

914
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.680
Matt Rogers of last Culture East is talking about losing his virginity to the

915
00:58:56.681 --> 00:59:00.550
manager of a clam bar.
No.
So romantic.
It's not always glamorous fence.

916
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:02.100
The great Rhea butcher,
uh,

917
00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:06.820
giving us essentially a masterclass on gender fluidity.
Robert Brown.

918
00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:10.750
Oh yes.
Talking about marriage and then like moments after the show drops,

919
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:14.950
proposing to his boyfriend and also during the episode flirting heavily with

920
00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:18.430
Dave Holmes.
Is that related to the proposal that I followed shortly after?

921
00:59:18.431 --> 00:59:22.640
I don't know.
You have to listen to find out.
Not For us to know.
Uh,
Dan savage,

922
00:59:22.641 --> 00:59:25.940
who,
you know,
he's,
he's a genius.
Sex and Love Guru right here near Wolf,

923
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:30.330
breaking down,
being monogamous.
Tom's more,
uh,
it was a great year.
Uh,

924
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:32.990
if you like really good stories,
if you like laughing a ton,

925
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:37.640
if you like going real deep on your pop culture,
uh,
and your,
and your,

926
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.600
uh,
your,
your self help,
your queer theory,

927
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:46.700
but fun.
Listen to hemophilia with me,
