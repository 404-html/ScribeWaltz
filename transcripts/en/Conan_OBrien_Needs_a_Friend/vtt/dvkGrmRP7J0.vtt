Hey,

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:07.590
if you're listening to this podcast and you enjoy it and you really like it and

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:09.840
you're thinking to yourself,
I want to support Conan,

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.590
I want to help him in his quest to make the greatest podcast that ever was or

5
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.740
ever will be.
Well,
if you want to help,
uh,
you can,

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.150
you see we need the help of some great advertisers and in order to find great

7
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:24.540
advertisers,
we actually need to know a little bit more about you.

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.500
Not in a creepy way and a helpful way.
So if you're interested in helping out,

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.530
please go to pod survey.com/conan that's pod survey.com/conan.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
Take a quick anonymous survey that will help us get to know you a little better.

11
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.260
That way we can show advertisers how great our listeners are and then the whole

12
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:47.010
thing comes together in a beautiful way.
Plus,
once you've completed the survey,

13
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:51.360
you can choose to enter for a chance to win a $100 Amazon gift card.
Of course,

16
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.530
thanks very much for even thinking about lending a hand.
Appreciate it.

17
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.570
<v 2>Hi,
my name is Kristen Bell.</v>

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.533
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

19
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.300
<v 2>And I feel super charged about being Conan O'brien's friends.</v>

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.333
<v 3>Oops.</v>

21
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.040
<v 1>Hey there.
Welcome to Conan O'brien needs a friend.</v>

22
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.590
This is the show where I Conan O'Brien,

23
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.040
talk to celebrities and interesting personalities.

24
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.640
I want the hope of maybe finally finding a true friend,

25
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.540
not someone who's on my payroll.
Those tend to be the people I hang out with,

26
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:57.110
writers,
producers,
people that work for me.
I want a real friend that likes me.

27
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:57.944
For me,

28
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.300
I'm aided in my quest by my trusty assistant Sono obsession.

29
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.090
<v 2>Hi.
And my producer Matt Gorley.
Hi there.</v>

30
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.650
<v 1>Today's guest is Kristen Bell.</v>

31
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.010
She's an amazing talent and an incredible person and thrilled that she's here.

32
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.810
<v 2>I like being people's friends.</v>

33
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.840
I think that the point of like earth is to be friendly and nice and to share it

34
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:32.810
with other people because it doesn't work when we're all islands.

35
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.310
I got to tell you,

36
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.550
I was having sort of a down morning and you walked in here and you are just this

37
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:44.720
burst of energy and goodwill.
Too much.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

38
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:48.380
I would say take it up a little.
Oh,
okay.
I need a stronger dose.
No,

39
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:52.140
that was very nice and I agree with you.
I think that is a,
yeah,

40
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.240
the the point and one of the reasons as I think you know,

41
00:02:56.241 --> 00:03:00.070
and maybe you understand my plight,
I work pretty hard.

42
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:05.071
I have a busy life and I don't think people even realize how hard you work and

43
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:07.960
not in the sense of like we're not coal miners.

44
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.570
It's not like the most physical activity,
but the,

45
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.970
the amount of brain power it takes in the amount of hours.

46
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:17.310
I know I've seen how you guys work harder than a Columbian.

47
00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:21.160
Very busy.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm going to double down on that.

48
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.580
I think my life is more day to day is more dangerous than a coal miner and

49
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.060
toxic,
toxic.
And I think they should pity me and I'm,

50
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.930
maybe I'm going to get mail for this.
Okay.

51
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.400
But I don't think people mail letters anymore,
so I'm going to let that go.
But I,

52
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.210
I do.
It's hard.
It's a,
it's a,
an an,
you don't have a wife.

53
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:47.670
I have kids.
So what happens is I,
I realize we're,

54
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.240
am I pals that I hang out with my,
where's my Dang,

55
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:54.910
which would pass or have time for that.
Yeah.

56
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:58.090
But then I also need people that are willing to do it.

57
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.880
And that's what's beyond it.
That's on you.

58
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.450
What do you mean you got to make yourself available and you got to put out some

59
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.390
sunshine so that people want to do that with you want to hang out with you.

60
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.510
And you mentioned that when you have a party,
everyone's,

61
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.150
you look around and everyone's on your payroll.
I mean,
dare,

62
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.670
I would say those are better friends.
That's true.

63
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:22.450
I have country is they're on your payroll and also I can control their behavior.

64
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.370
Well,
no,
it's because it's because you have a shared goal.

65
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.730
Oh because I find my marriage works.
My,

66
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.710
when I get along with my kids the best.

67
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:37.270
When anything is when you have a shared goal with someone,
I mean that's why we,

68
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:41.290
I mean we developed out of tribes and when you find a tribe with a shared goal,

69
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.650
you tend to bond with them and you tend to react better towards anything they

70
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:49.150
say and find them less dangerous.
And when you have a shared goal,
like your show,

71
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.750
they want to stay employed.
It's their job.

72
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.450
They don't like work here because they want to lose their job.
It's,

73
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.420
they have an incentive to keep working here,

74
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:00.850
which means they want to be friendly.
You guys have a shared goal.

75
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:03.820
It's the production.
They know that you know,
it's not just you,

76
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:05.500
it's all these people sitting in this room and they,

77
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:09.490
there's like so many people in this room.
So many of them don't do anything.

78
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.900
Which ones I guess you know who you are.
Dead Weight,
dead weight,
dead weight.

79
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.450
There's a lot of dead weight.

80
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.500
And I say that with love because you need a certain amount of dead weight.

81
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.040
This leads me to my question.
Okay.
For example,

82
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.580
my wife and I have enjoyed the company of you and Dax and you guys are a

83
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:35.221
fantastic couple and I thought we all got along and I was thinking is it

84
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:40.810
possible that we could all be real friends?
Is that a possibility?
I think so.

85
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:42.910
Okay.
You hesitated.
Hesitated

86
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.610
because I want expectations to be accurate and reasonable because the reality is

87
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:55.111
we also have very busy lifestyles and you have a very busy lifestyle.

88
00:05:56.501 --> 00:06:00.110
So we just to,
you know,
like the Buddhist say like desire and yearning.

89
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:03.650
It's just like a wasted emotion.
So like saying we owe,

90
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:06.350
we should strive to get together once a week.
That's never going to happen.

91
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.460
But like once every couple months planning it like a dinner or something or like

92
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:14.090
a pool party,
that could totally happen.
So we go in and say,

93
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:15.560
what do we want to commit to?

94
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.700
Cause we like spending social time together and there are shared goal is

95
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:22.290
friendship,
friendship,
right?

96
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.530
And then we can definitely do it because you need buddies.

97
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.170
I need some real friends,
you know,
and,
and,
and I'll tell you something else.
Um,

98
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.560
I'm very comfortable,

99
00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:38.561
really comfortable with you and really comfortable with your husband and my wife

100
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:41.870
likes you guys.
And so it just feels like,
you know what,

101
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:44.290
people like my wife a lot more than they like me.
Yeah.

102
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.690
My assistant's Sona who's here once said to me,
your wife's,

103
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:49.430
the only thing I like about

104
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.770
it is it is true.
What an honest friend

105
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.690
David thinking about calling it.
A lot of people have that.

106
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:04.691
I was at a restaurant last night and I was sitting there alone because I had to

107
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:07.760
go downtown and do a show and I was putting my notes together.

108
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:11.480
So I just went to grab a quick bite and I'm name dropping here,

109
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.670
but Reese Witherspoon is that the next booth?
And uh,
she's like Conan,

110
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:19.670
Conan,
where's your wife?
And I said,
I'm,
I'm just here alone.

111
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.880
I'm working on my setlist for this show I have to do tonight.
And she said,

112
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.860
I love Leisa.
I love your wife.
Anyone.
Yeah.
And I'm thinking,

113
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.430
what about me?
What am I checking?
As they said back in the day.
What about me?

114
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:35.860
What am I chopped liver right here.
Shut up liver,
whatever,

115
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.550
but you know,
but,
but,
or,
okay,
this is the problem here.
Look,

116
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.890
I'm rolling up my sleeves.
We're about to dig in.
What's that?

117
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.290
What happened was something on your skin.
This Elmers glue.

118
00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:49.410
I think we were making crafts last night or you were sniffing glue.
Is it good?

119
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.410
Can you get,
Oh,
it's
frustrating.

120
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.900
You are wearing the you,
you need to switch classes.
Okay.

121
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.380
The Lens you're looking through.
Oh,
this is a metaphor I thought you meant.

122
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.980
I really do need different ones.
Yeah,
those aren't working.
I'm Reese Witherspoon.

123
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.140
You didn't even recognize me.

124
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.950
I just saw a blonde blob and I didn't know what all understandable,

125
00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:17.510
but Reese Witherspoon would never have crossed to God.
No.
God,

126
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.423
no.

127
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.700
You can't see within that situation how that's a compliment to you because you

128
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:24.680
pick,
not only did you pick your wife,

129
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.460
but your wife loves you and if your wife is so wonderful,

130
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.200
her number one pick is you.
You can't see that as a compliment.
I'm not sure.

131
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:37.120
I was number one.
Okay.
She may have suit.

132
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.150
Who knows whatever options were at the time,

133
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.650
but she didn't choose to be with you and all of these other people who gravitate

134
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:48.800
towards your wife and her loveliness.
Your,
her number one.

135
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:51.350
That's a compliment to you.
She was a,

136
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:55.800
it was between me and Ryan Gosling at the time.
Wait,
sorry,
what was that?

137
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.210
Nothing.
I was,
I dunno,
maybe she settled.
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.630
It's Ryan Gosling.

139
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.810
Here's my theory about why you feel like you don't have friends because I

140
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:11.460
personally know a lot of people that love you and your time,

141
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.060
your available time in your day is not the reason that you don't have

142
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:18.480
friendships while it is,
but maybe you don't do enough self care.

143
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.420
What do you do for self care?
What do you do that just for you?
Wow.

144
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.630
That's just for you now.
For the show.
Not for anything.

145
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:32.320
Like do listen to a podcast like I do,
like I like history.
Okay.

146
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.030
Dax and I have that in common.
Yeah,
like books on tape.

147
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:39.280
I like listening to long histories.
Uh,

148
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.150
if I go on a vacation with in with my family,

149
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.580
everyone else is reading sort of like a light book and I've got a William

150
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.410
Shirer's rise and fall of the Third Reich,

151
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.050
which is a big black book with a swastika on it.

152
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:57.050
And I'm reading it in a bathing suit with a rum drink and getting closer to why

153
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.670
you don't have friends.
We're getting closer.
Um,
so okay,

154
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.430
so first of all covered the book kitty stickers or something.

155
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.530
That's number one.
Somebody wants to,
can we swear on this podcast?

156
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.660
Can nobody wants a fucking swastika on their book.

157
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.050
You know what I should've done is put like a sisterhood of the traveling pants

158
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:17.310
jacket over that book.

159
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.370
People thought it was real sisterhood of the traveling pants,

160
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:23.070
but I'm really reading about it was such a great fit.

161
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:26.730
Any more contacts in your phone?
If you sat on the beach reading sisterhood,

162
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.630
people becoming up and dropping their phone number on your lap,

163
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:35.040
do you even know the plot of that?
Is it is missing their drawers?

164
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:39.420
I'm assuming their slacks,
they,
there's genes and different girls wear them.

165
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.910
And does anyone understand central here?
The probably pants.

166
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.140
All I know is there's a pair of pants that fits all of them.
Oh.

167
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.120
And shared goal and shared goals.
It's like a community thing.

168
00:10:51.121 --> 00:10:55.710
Something that bonds them together.
Shared goal.
So you,

169
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.270
you,
you don't have time.
So your expectations are all scatty want this.

170
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:04.170
You don't have time.
So yeah.
So if you want friends,

171
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:06.570
you've got to make time for your friends,
which means you gotta be like,

172
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:10.710
what two hours a week can I carve out?
You've got to schedule it.

173
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:13.620
Just like you schedule this podcast,
you scheduled this with me,

174
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.440
you schedule The bits that you take for your show.
You schedule your show.

175
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:20.410
What time do we shoe?
When we shoot guys with time,
he,
we shoot for four 30.
Yeah.

176
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.880
You schedule that.
He make a little time for your buddies or some self care.

177
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.020
You go get your nails done,
you take a bath,
you go on a hike.

178
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.980
I actually exercised quite a bit.
But,
uh,

179
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.180
I never sit in a bath because I don't have the patience to just sit and they

180
00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:38.820
probably don't fit well in the tub too.
I don't,
yeah,
I seek dangle off the end.

181
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.680
Basically.
It's just my torso in the bath.
Nope.
You're like,
yeah,

182
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:44.850
you're sitting in a sauce pan.

183
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:50.090
So like maybe like a steam room or a sauna or get a massage or just go on a walk

184
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.750
by myself.
Yeah.
This is what I'm saying.
You don't,
you,
you,
you,

185
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.870
you're maybe,
oh my God.
You guys.

186
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.920
Maybe the Pete,
the other people aren't the answer.
Maybe your,
the answer.

187
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.240
Maybe you need to become friends with yourself.

188
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.410
You need to play dramatic music here or like music.
Like a light.

189
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.460
Just enlightenment.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If we can afford it.

190
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.420
Well,
I'm noticing you take really good care of yourself.

191
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.070
You have seven different drinks right here.
Now there's a green drink.

192
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.030
I don't know what that is.
Water h two o that's water.

193
00:12:32.031 --> 00:12:35.930
But this looks like you took a rain forest and put it in a blender.
Yeah.

194
00:12:35.931 --> 00:12:37.600
This is macho.
This is much it.

195
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:41.120
And then I got a protein shake in there and a green tea in there because I like

196
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.620
I,
I hydrate a lot and I need to have different types of hydration's in order to

197
00:12:45.621 --> 00:12:47.440
feel safe.
It's like,
I don't know,

198
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:50.780
I always have a big bag like that and it's always filled with just the bottle

199
00:12:50.781 --> 00:12:52.610
after bottle of different liquids.

200
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.210
And sometimes I'm got a coffee in there and mostly Amartya I just,

201
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.180
I need a lot of different drinks and then I do waters cause I don't like to come

202
00:12:59.181 --> 00:13:01.300
and waste the plastic water bottle.
So.

203
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.970
So you're going to the restroom every five minutes?
No,
weirdly not.
I like,

204
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.040
I like a camel.
I don't know.
This is interesting.
So what I've picked up so far,

205
00:13:10.041 --> 00:13:14.450
and I'm not saying that you're wrong,
is that I need to drink a lot of liquids.

206
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.780
I need to realize that I'm the problem and I need to walk by myself.

207
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:24.920
Yeah.
Okay.
That's my bag and get a longer tub.
Yeah,
that's,
you can find them.

208
00:13:24.921 --> 00:13:28.040
But those long tubs are probably so expensive.
Yeah.
Okay.

209
00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:30.110
Let's talk about this cause that's interesting.

210
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.600
You are a frugal woman and I say that as a compliment.

211
00:13:33.601 --> 00:13:35.540
They time you are a big time for a woman.

212
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:40.250
Is that come from just the way you were raised?
I mean you use,
you use coupons,

213
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.260
you uh,
but like why not use a coupon?
Exactly,
yes.
The way I was raised.

214
00:13:45.261 --> 00:13:48.380
I mean I um,
I grew up in Detroit.
My husband and I are both like this,

215
00:13:48.381 --> 00:13:51.190
but I think that's because of where we grew up.
There was,
you know,

216
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.710
a bit of a scarcity factors.

217
00:13:52.711 --> 00:13:57.711
So out here I also work really hard for money also like to support things that I

218
00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.930
believe in like charities and philanthropy endeavors.

219
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.480
And so I like to have money.

220
00:14:05.481 --> 00:14:09.830
I prefer to have money to do that kind of stuff and then cut corners with
myself,

221
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.880
not with myself.
It's not like I'm like,
you know,
wearing holes in my shoes.

222
00:14:13.881 --> 00:14:14.950
But um,

223
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.400
I have realized that spending like a ton of money on myself and not being

224
00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:23.990
responsible doesn't make me any happier.

225
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.080
Yes.
It actually makes me happier to like sort of penny pinch and then be like,

226
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.200
oh,
I can donate to this when I want to.
And it's incredibly a,

227
00:14:30.201 --> 00:14:33.800
you have a great moral compass.
You really do.
You is,

228
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:38.600
how much of that do you credit to Catholicism growing up Catholic?
Oh,

229
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.730
no,
no,
no.
I mean,
no,
no,

230
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.480
no,
because I definitely,
like I went to Catholic school and grew up Catholic,

231
00:14:47.481 --> 00:14:50.960
but I am not Catholic.
I am sort of have no religion.
I'm a humanist.

232
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.900
And I think,
I mean,

233
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:56.360
I suppose being in a community growing up,

234
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:59.700
which I think sometimes churches do well and there,
you know,

235
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.990
I take a lot of issue with a lot of other things they do.
But I think um,

236
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:09.010
community building does make you realize how to walk in someone else's shoes,

237
00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:13.540
how to recognize empathy and where it exists and sort of,
yeah,

238
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.190
figuring out that you're not alone.
I think that's really important.

239
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.030
But I think that can be done within a church or within a theater group or within

240
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:23.870
a baseball team or within your family if you have a lot of siblings or even if

241
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:27.410
you have none,
you know,
it's not,
church isn't the only place growing up.

242
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:28.700
I grew up in a very catholic,

243
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.000
I don't really think my morality came from the Catholic Church.

244
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.590
I really do think so much of it is monkey see monkey do.
Oh,
all of it is.
And I,

245
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.000
with my,
you know,

246
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.140
if my son ever is like somewhat rude to my wife or something else,
say,

247
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.250
do you ever see us talk to each other that and do we ever talk to you that way?

248
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.220
And I can see him realize,
oh no,
I've never,

249
00:15:52.221 --> 00:15:55.670
I don't witness that day to day it's,
he can't argue with that.

250
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.460
Whereas if he saw us constantly don't cough,
we cannot,

251
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.740
it's one of my drinks.

252
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:05.270
If you didn't get enough of your 30 liters of algae,

253
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.000
um,
we did the same thing and in fact act.

254
00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:11.090
So it says when the girls are mean to me,
cause I'm more of a pushover,
he'll go,

255
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:12.890
don't you dare talk to my wife that way.

256
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:16.520
Like he'll use it as a defense of me and Renee Brown,

257
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:18.500
who's one of my favorite writers,
says,

258
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.080
you cannot give your children anything you do not have.

259
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.640
So like I can't give my children the ability to have a good positive body image

260
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.560
unless I have a good positive body image.

261
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.940
So it's worth recognizing that if you want your children to grow up happy and

262
00:16:31.941 --> 00:16:33.770
well rounded and be surrounded by friends,

263
00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:38.210
you have to show them that in your existence and self care and all those things.

264
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.060
Got to give it to them.

265
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.930
You got to show it to the little ones because they don't listen to Jack Shit

266
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:43.940
that you say.
They just ignore it.

267
00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:47.270
But when they see you talk to people or they see you after they see you say,

268
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.660
I need 20 minutes to go sit by myself and read,
or I need to meditate,

269
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:51.900
or I'm going to take a walk around the block,

270
00:16:51.901 --> 00:16:54.170
or I'm going to exercise for my body,
or I'm going to take a nap,

271
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:56.600
or I'm gonna call my mom.
They witnessed those things.

272
00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.700
That's the big rule I've always had with my kids is you a lot of choices about

273
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.180
what you're going to do with your life,
but you're going to be nice.

274
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.330
Like that is going to be polite and you're going to be nice.

275
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.860
That's the thing that I'm always on them for.
My wife is too,

276
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.010
you know when we're in a,
in a restaurant and the waiter comes,
if,

277
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.710
if they're not making eye contact and saying hello,
thank you,

278
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.810
could I please have?
I'm all over him being nice to everybody,
be nice to people,

279
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:26.750
but in a,
in a genuine way.
But just you have to,
you know,

280
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.780
and how old are your kids?
They're in their late fifties.
Okay.

281
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.300
So they probably understand this a little bit more.

282
00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:34.910
But Mike mine are at like concept level.

283
00:17:34.911 --> 00:17:38.290
They don't listen to what we say and they don't really understand why is,

284
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.810
but my husband is so good at giving everyone context and I've learned from him

285
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:45.170
that like when they're ordering as opposed to going like look at her,

286
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:48.770
look at her,
cause all they're like,
why?
So My I,

287
00:17:48.771 --> 00:17:50.850
Oregon has to look at her Oregon while I,

288
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.950
what does that have to do with me choosing a cheeseburger?

289
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.520
But I say like when they leave or before they come up,
I'll say,

290
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.220
oh look at the waiter.
Um,

291
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.610
it looks like maybe he's been working here for all day today and maybe he's got

292
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:04.770
a family at home.
Do you think he has kids?
He might,

293
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.770
he might wish this day went by quicker so he could see his kids.

294
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.920
He looks like he's a really hard worker because I see all those plates in his

295
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:12.480
hand.
He's doing a really great job.

296
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.630
So I identify the person that they should be kind to as another valuable human

297
00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:18.894
being.
Right.

298
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:23.790
So that they hopefully take the initiative to then recognize him in an sort of

299
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:28.350
empathic way that,
oh,
I should be nice to him.
I want to say this.

300
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:32.550
I want to say that in this town,
in Los Angeles,

301
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.690
in this business,

302
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.260
I think what you're talking about is not that common unfortunately.

303
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.190
And that's because people don't take the time to recognize that everyone else is

304
00:18:41.191 --> 00:18:44.490
also a human being that has a favorite color and a favorite ice cream and a mom

305
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.890
that annoys them.
And uh,
you know,

306
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.260
someone that they're dating and a favorite pair of shoes.

307
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.840
Everybody has those favorite things.
It's not just you.
But I think one of the,

308
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.430
one of the biggest problems in Los Angeles is,
and I've noticed this,

309
00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.540
there are other areas where you're forced to constantly be in contact and it's a

310
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:02.970
good thing,
but whether you like it or not,

311
00:19:02.971 --> 00:19:06.330
you have to be in contact with people that have more than you,
less than you.

312
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.740
And here in Los Angeles you can carve out a life.

313
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.100
And I think increasingly this is what's happening in this country because of

314
00:19:14.101 --> 00:19:18.180
technology.
People can carve out a life where they get up in the morning,

315
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.620
they get in their car,

316
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.540
they go exactly to their place and when they're in their car,

317
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:28.800
they only listen to exactly the kind of music and news that they want to hear.

318
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.440
They don't have to interact with anybody else.

319
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:36.890
And then they get to the place where they do the specific thing.

320
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.570
They ordered,
the exact things they want on Amazon.

321
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.380
They watched the exact shows that give them pleasure and they're never exposed

322
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:47.220
to anything like a devil's advocate point of view or a person that thinks

323
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:50.100
differently or just something.
Well look,
look,
that's,

324
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.520
it's normal for us as monkeys to want to do that.
That's tribal.

325
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:57.700
You want to find sameness always.
But you believe in evolution.
I do.

326
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.370
Oh,
I'm so sorry.
You should go.
I'll take my drinks for having me.

327
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.270
I believe that we,
a man was created in 1922

328
00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.320
deal.
Tell me more.
And all the animals.

329
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:13.020
It was in 1922 and then we have implanted memories.

330
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.340
This makes so much more sense than what I was looking at,

331
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:21.330
like archeological records.
And No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Don't do that.

332
00:20:21.331 --> 00:20:25.130
That's a mistake that was all put there to trick us.
That makes sense.

333
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.050
Noah's Ark,
and this is actually a true fact.

334
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:33.730
A Noah's Ark was built in 1919 so by Russell Crowe.

335
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.300
Exactly.
A guy who I don't think he and I are becoming friends anytime soon.

336
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.660
We're gonna have to take a quick break.
I don't know much about podcasts,

337
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:45.120
but I think during this break I'm going to make millions of dollars.

338
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.440
Congratulations.
Let's do this.

339
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.770
<v 1>Take a break.</v>

340
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:49.900
<v 3>Oh,</v>

341
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.580
<v 1>now it's time for a segment called Conan O'Brien pays off the mortgage on his</v>

342
00:20:58.581 --> 00:21:03.020
beach house.
It took out a big mortgage beach house.
Then I just on an impulse,

343
00:21:03.021 --> 00:21:06.890
I built a big deck.
Turns out it's not legal.
I didn't get clearance.

344
00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.130
You just built it without asking anyone.
If it was okay to belt.

345
00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.820
I built it myself and I'm not even a good builder.
Yeah,

346
00:21:13.821 --> 00:21:18.230
that was stupid to really,
back then,
no architectural drawings built it myself.

347
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.180
Most of it fell down on its own,

348
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.630
but then it turned out I had to remove the rest because it was illegal.

349
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:24.980
So anyway,

350
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.680
Hey,
all this fall I've been checking something off my bucket list for years and

351
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:39.520
years and years.
It's been my dream to go out on tour,
hit the road with,

352
00:21:39.521 --> 00:21:41.920
so my favorite comics and I've been doing that.

353
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:45.160
In fact right now I'm recording this in my hotel room in Austin,

354
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:49.580
Texas cause we got a show here tonight.
It's a nice hotel room than mine.

355
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.730
It's much nicer than yours.

356
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:57.080
I put you in the same room as the giant ice machine and the extra towels it and

357
00:21:57.081 --> 00:22:01.660
it's a fun show.
Sona,
you've seen many of them.
Yes.
It's a really fun show.

358
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:05.710
All the comics are amazing.
Absolutely.
And how am I good?

359
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.240
Oh Geez.
Anyway,
it's been a blast.

360
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.350
It's a lot of fun.
And uh,

361
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:19.360
we are headed soon to Chicago,
Minneapolis and in Milwaukee.

362
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.620
So if you're in Chicago,

363
00:22:20.621 --> 00:22:24.280
Minneapolis or Milwaukee and you want to come see the show,

364
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:26.230
I guarantee you'll have a good time.

365
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.500
Grab tickets@teencoco.com slash tour and so now I will get you a better room.

366
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:35.380
Do you have a window in your room?
No,
I did ask them not to give you a window.

367
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.190
I don't think it's an actual room.
I sleep on the floor.
Yeah,

368
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.900
it's a storage space.

369
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.320
This may surprise some people,
but I am not just a podcaster.

370
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.190
I also dabble in a little something called television.
Oh yeah.

371
00:22:56.191 --> 00:23:01.190
For a little while.
Just 25 years.
Sorry to come across angry.
Anyway,

372
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.910
I have this TV show that I've been taking all over the world.
Uh,

373
00:23:05.911 --> 00:23:10.380
and I love doing this.
I've gone to places like Cuba,
Armenia.

374
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.500
We went to Armenia.
SONA.
That was fun.
Yeah,
we went to Haiti.

375
00:23:13.501 --> 00:23:16.830
We went to South Korea.
So many different countries.

376
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.320
I love these episodes.
Well,

377
00:23:19.321 --> 00:23:24.321
I just want to tell you that my new episode of Conan Without Borders is about to

378
00:23:25.231 --> 00:23:29.370
come out.
And in this one I traveled to Japan.
Sona,

379
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:34.320
you've seen the Japan show.
It's absolutely hilarious.
Yeah,
it's really funny.

380
00:23:34.321 --> 00:23:36.720
It's really funny.
There's a lot of fun surprises in it.

381
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:41.730
Very proud of this episode.
You visited a place called Conan town.
Yes.

382
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.400
In Japan.
I have a lot of adventures.
There's a few,

383
00:23:44.401 --> 00:23:47.250
there's a little guest appearance there.
It's really fun.
Yeah.

384
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.930
And so I'm hoping people will check it out.
Kona Without Borders.

385
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:55.931
Japan air is November 28th on TBS and make sure to visit team coco.com/japan to

386
00:23:59.661 --> 00:24:02.830
look at all kinds of behind the scenes stuff,
extras,

387
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.820
live streams and more.

388
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.020
Thank you.
I'm new to this podcast thing.
How long have you been doing this?
Uh,

389
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.950
I think 48 hours.
No,
48 hours straight.

390
00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:22.770
I,
I'm on a lithium drift.
Um,

391
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.210
uh,
I've been doing this,
this is pretty new I have to say.
And I,

392
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.960
there's a bunch of things I really like about it.

393
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.710
And actually today when I was driving in and I was excited to come in and talk

394
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:37.700
to you,
I'm driving to work and I started to think to myself,
oh,

395
00:24:37.701 --> 00:24:41.150
I need to get there a little early to leave time for makeup.
And then I realize,

396
00:24:41.151 --> 00:24:44.000
no,
you get to just look at my,

397
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.380
what's it meant rapidly aging folks.
I'll be honest,

398
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.430
Irish men after 50,
we're just like,
I mean,
look,

399
00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:54.350
I'm right around the corner that Pale skin and my God,

400
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.410
we had some spice in us because it's,
we're doomed.

401
00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:00.590
You're going to be beautiful forever.
You are.
I,

402
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.860
there's a gene inside may,

403
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:07.970
a certain kind of Irish male where he looks okay for a while and then around 50,

404
00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:13.211
the gene triggers and our heads become sort of a bloated orange,

405
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:17.030
uh,
massive cauliflower and uh,
and,

406
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:20.630
and our bodies fall apart and that's happening.

407
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.840
That's happening to me and I'm fighting it.
I'm going to do whatever I can.

408
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:28.700
I'm going to get radical surgery.
Just pull it,
tape it.
Lucille Ball.

409
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:29.840
Did you know what Lucille Ball did?

410
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.400
She used to use tape and she would take,

411
00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.550
everyone still does that.
Oh,

412
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.640
she use tape and then she put the big orange wig on top of it.

413
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:44.120
There's a lot of people who sell men and women who take like the sides of their

414
00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:46.190
cheeks or their forehead.

415
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.780
And especially even back here and when I'm doing for the viewer is holding my

416
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.350
mandible and pulling it back towards the lobes of my ears.

417
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:58.070
And then they take it back there.
But you got to hide the tape.
Yeah.

418
00:25:58.071 --> 00:26:01.900
But you can hide that with like a little like teasing of the hair.
Let's see.

419
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.300
That's easier for women.
Blue Painter's tape.
They're using clear tape.

420
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.590
Oh,
I was imagining painters.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

421
00:26:09.591 --> 00:26:11.740
I'm just imagining that I should have specified.

422
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.230
I was imagining Dora the explorer bandaids that are big and colorful.

423
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.840
You know what I think I'm going to do and I'm not,
I'm not,

424
00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:22.310
I don't want to get any kind of surgery.
And I love working and I love,
uh,

425
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.440
being on television.
I love the whole thing,

426
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.090
but I don't want to get any kind of surgery to fix my face.

427
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.840
So what I'm going to do now that I'm,
uh,
you know,

428
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.800
slowly aging is a use tape.
I'm going to use tape,

429
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.340
but I'm going to switch to a wig because the wig,
we'll hide the tape.

430
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.100
Don't you see if it's a clear,
it's hay and it'll be like what Lucille ball did.

431
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.940
<v 2>You'll never,
ever,
not in this town or any other town,</v>

432
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:52.180
get awake as good as that hair.
I've got great hair.
You've got gray hair.
Great,

433
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.670
great.
Have game show host hair.
You know,
I get excited when I see it.
I'm like,

434
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.380
here's Conan.
That's right.

435
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.670
The hair and makeup is very annoying and podcasts don't require anything of you.

436
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.260
My husband loves doing his podcast because he,
he just has to sit there.

437
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:08.880
I couldn't believe it doesn't have to do hair and makeup,

438
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:11.610
laziest job in the world,
and here's the way,
so built for it.

439
00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:15.600
He loves asking intimate questions to strangers.
Yeah.
He's always,

440
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:18.030
the person that has asked gets way too intimate way too quick,

441
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.900
and that's literally no,
his job.
I'm the podcast.
I was shocked.
I did his podcast.

442
00:27:21.901 --> 00:27:26.400
I loved it.
He's terrific.
Terrific interviewer.
But I was really,

443
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:30.840
he just sits in this big,
it's a lazy boy,
big lazy boy,

444
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:36.120
and he's got a microphone near his face,
but his posture isn't good.

445
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.730
He's,
he's,
he's collapsed in the lazy boy.

446
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.610
Like he's just sending the maximum comfort.

447
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.450
He's at maximum you would you sit in it?
He probably didn't let him know.

448
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.730
He didn't let me sit in it,
the most comfortable chair on the planet.
And look,

449
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.250
it's slightly bulky for my opinion.

450
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.930
I bought it for him cause I put it in his office when he was working here at

451
00:27:51.931 --> 00:27:55.050
Warner brothers.
Did you get it for a good rate?
I paid a premium.

452
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.450
I paid a premium for that chair.
It's a very good chair,

453
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.720
but it's a lazy boy chair and it kicks back and it's the most comfortable thing

454
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.490
I've ever sat it.
And so I bought,
do you know about this whole this,

455
00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:08.760
we made this a pretty public saga at the time,

456
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:11.610
but a couple of years ago I bought it for his office and then his office here at

457
00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:14.670
Warner Brothers closed because the project ended.
He brought it home,

458
00:28:14.671 --> 00:28:17.130
it put it in my living room while I was like,
excuse me,

459
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:22.370
which would have been fine to discuss except he put it directly in front of the

460
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:27.330
couch facing the television.
Not Angled towards like a nice funkshway.

461
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.210
Literally,
literally,
let me describe this.

462
00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:33.150
So the couch is up against the wall and let's say that's the TV.

463
00:28:33.151 --> 00:28:36.300
So the couch of faces,
the television,
he put it in the middle,

464
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:40.110
like in front of the coffee table facing the television.
I was like,
what?

465
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.930
What are you doing this that?
That's an aggressive literally and I've,

466
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:48.240
I have posted photos of me watching a movie looking at the back of his head.

467
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.080
I said,
this is so unacceptable.
And I guess what?

468
00:28:52.081 --> 00:28:55.250
I couldn't lift the chair so I couldn't move it.
It's a big chance,

469
00:28:55.251 --> 00:29:00.060
so heavy and it's so well made and it's so comfortable.
So I'm mad at it,

470
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:00.900
but I also love it.

471
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.080
So when he got the podcast and he started doing it in the attic,

472
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.620
he moved the chair up to the attic.
Yeah.
The whole time I was talking to him,

473
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:08.731
I was just thinking,

474
00:29:08.731 --> 00:29:13.340
he is so comfortable and I'm not as the chair I was sitting in his mind,

475
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.680
the little,
it's something that you,
it's the chair a nurse makes you sit in a,

476
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.110
you know,
an iron share.
While you,

477
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:22.590
while she draws blood in a clinic that's not well run,

478
00:29:22.591 --> 00:29:23.790
we've got to do better for our guests.

479
00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:26.430
Because the other thing about that podcast room is it doesn't have a door on the

480
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:29.280
bathroom,
which he finds notice that totally acceptable.

481
00:29:29.281 --> 00:29:32.670
And I am just apoplectic about,

482
00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:36.030
I can also a window in the bathroom that doesn't have a,

483
00:29:36.031 --> 00:29:40.190
so I urinated after the podcast because I drank a lot of water.
Okay.

484
00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.580
Channeling you and then,

485
00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.370
and there is no curtain and the,

486
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.760
I don't know how to say this,
but there's,
it's just open to the street,

487
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.620
that window.
And so

488
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:58.240
and so I was urinating and let's just say everything's out,
you know,
as,

489
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.320
as it has to be what a man urinates and I'm thinking it would be so easy right

490
00:30:02.321 --> 00:30:07.080
now for somebody to get a shot of me with my don Johnson.
Uh,

491
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.830
and just assuming that's what everyone calls there is,
um,
uh,

492
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.790
not an ideal situation,
but he seems to think it's acceptable.

493
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.950
And like we had Katie Kirk in there and I was,

494
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.860
I was like trying to welcome her and be like a host set,

495
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:24.680
put like little candles in their forum and like try to make it nice and like,

496
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.670
I was like,
Katie,
I'm so sorry that you have to pee.
And she was like,

497
00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:30.130
there's no door on the bathroom.
I'm not going to pee in here.
And I was like,

498
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:33.190
secretly I was like,
yes,
Katie,
stand up for yourself.
But look,

499
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:35.080
that's like his kit.
He likes it.

500
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.170
It's makes them laugh that there's no door on the bathroom.

501
00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:42.970
You're a very understanding your,
you love him for who he is.

502
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.940
He's a lovable guy there.
Lots of love.
But,
um,

503
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:51.130
I love how accepting you are of other people.
I have realistic expectations.

504
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:53.830
I cannot change anyone else.
It's not my podcast.

505
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.430
I'm allowed to put a lavender scented candle in there,
but I'm,
you know,

506
00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:58.810
it's not my podcast.
He's,

507
00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.150
he's allowed to treat his guests how he wants to treat them.

508
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.740
I want to ask you quickly,
and people don't know this about us that much,

509
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:10.780
but we both have motorcycle licenses.
Ah,
yes,

510
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:12.510
I know.
Uh,

511
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.370
that was something that I just always wanted to do at some point and I did it a

512
00:31:15.371 --> 00:31:19.780
bunch of years ago and I have all these rules with my bike.
Like I don't,

513
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:24.460
I ride it when no one else is around.
I'm very,
I think I'm extremely safe.

514
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:27.070
You know,
this is one of your self care items.

515
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.640
It is a self care item problem at time for that.

516
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.240
The problem is my wife not happy.

517
00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:38.110
Her deal was she said you can buy a motorcycle if it never leaves the living

518
00:31:38.111 --> 00:31:41.740
room.
She really doesn't want me out on a motorcycle.

519
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:45.060
Are you a good driver or no?
All right.
I'm good.
I mean,

520
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.150
as compared to what I mean,
I'm saying bad driver.
No,
no.
Oh,

521
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.530
very good.
Very good.
I said understand,
follow me here.
Okay.

522
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.260
Now I feel like one of your children,

523
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:02.470
because I have the say I have the same nerves about my husband riding.

524
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:07.420
Well,
he's an excellent,
the reason that I have to set up excellent.
Uh,

525
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:11.680
I mean he's been doing it his whole life.
No.
Am I in his league?

526
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:16.510
Not even close,
but I dunno,
it's,
it's very hard to describe to people.

527
00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:20.110
It sounds like,
oh,
you're just,
you're having some midlife crisis like,
no,

528
00:32:20.111 --> 00:32:21.100
it really is something.

529
00:32:21.101 --> 00:32:25.960
I was real rode bicycles for a really long time and I always thought this would

530
00:32:25.961 --> 00:32:27.910
be much more fun if there was an engine on this thing.

531
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.070
It feels good to my husband too.

532
00:32:30.071 --> 00:32:34.910
It feels the same way and I don't necessarily have that same feeling,
but I,

533
00:32:34.911 --> 00:32:39.650
and I have that feeling in other areas and I'm able to understand that that is

534
00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:40.910
very important to him.

535
00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:44.510
And then if it's not anything that I'm going to get him to stop doing or what I

536
00:32:44.511 --> 00:32:47.780
want him to stop doing,
if it's something that really makes them feel happy,

537
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.370
would you be willing to talk to my wife about this?
I love your wife.
Of course.

538
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:57.020
It's up to you.
Everyone lights up when he was a,

539
00:32:57.021 --> 00:33:00.500
you know,
as a compliment.
I will.
I will.

540
00:33:00.501 --> 00:33:02.690
I feel bad for Ryan Gosling.
He blew it.

541
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:05.990
I do want to compliment you.

542
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:11.120
It is very hard for my entire family to find one show that everybody likes that

543
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:15.980
matches my,
I'm such a comedy snob and good places.
The best show,

544
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.820
it really is.
It really is.
The writing is brilliant.

545
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.850
Performances are great and I think it's one of the most unique comedies that's

546
00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:26.090
been made.

547
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:30.770
I mean in the last 10 years I couldn't be happier at that job.

548
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.730
Would you be cool if that was what the afterlife would you be?

549
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:37.610
Would you accept that version of the afterlife?
Well,

550
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:43.030
yes and no because the show is about our characters did not get in or are having

551
00:33:43.791 --> 00:33:48.320
trouble getting in.
So I don't know that I look two separate questions.

552
00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:52.350
If Mike Schur ran my afterlife 100% right,
but be entertaining.

553
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.500
Even if you were in hell,
it would be entertained.
Yes.

554
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:57.950
But there's things that we have,
like things like toilets,
spiders,
and you know,

555
00:33:57.951 --> 00:34:00.920
all these crazy things he's invented in,
in,
in health.

556
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:05.921
But I think that it should be easier for people to get rewarded for good

557
00:34:06.621 --> 00:34:11.420
behavior.
Being human is very hard.
Maybe that's what we learned today.

558
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.210
I'm a guy that likes to summarize.
Um,

559
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.460
I'm also a guy that likes to wax this chest,

560
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.190
but I don't know why you needed to know that.
I'm,

561
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:25.850
I'm hard to summarize because I'm a nonlinear thinker and speaker and like

562
00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:27.080
somewhat of a scatter brain.

563
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:31.010
So like I make a whole bunch of weird points that don't often connect and just

564
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.180
talk and talk.
So it's not found that to be true.
Really?
No,
not at all.

565
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.870
I can tell that you read a lot.
I can tell that you're,

566
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:41.660
you're always on the hunt for new information,

567
00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:45.710
new information and what's the way to be?
I'm hungry and curious.

568
00:34:45.711 --> 00:34:50.540
You're hungry cause you're only drinking liquids.
All liquid diet.

569
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.060
Really know.
What are you going to have set a Bagel?

570
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.970
You had a Bagel and two eggs this morning and then I had a Bagel.

571
00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.070
You put them in a blender first and then everybody does that.
I don't think so.

572
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.030
Oh,

573
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:06.710
I want to end by saying my goal in the next year is I want to have one dinner

574
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:11.030
with my wife and I and you and Dax.
I'd like us to fight over the check,

575
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.900
but then I'd like to win and pay for it.
I can be a part of this plan.

576
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:18.640
This is a reasonable expectation.
This is not an expensive restaurant.
Okay.

577
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:22.460
I know a place in Santa Monica,
it takes a whole fish,

578
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.890
the whole fish and puts it in a blender and then everyone gets a big beer Stein

579
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:31.150
and they drink the fish out of the Beer Stein.
Okay.
Take that lender,

580
00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.050
drive it from Santa Monica to the east side of Los Angeles.
Okay.

581
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.040
And then we can do it.
You know what I'm going to do,
going to take the bus,

582
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.230
<v 1>I'm going to take the next step right in front of me.
Yeah.</v>

583
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:46.170
And I can bring rob blended fish with me.

584
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.810
Can I tell you how excited I am getting for this dinner date?

585
00:35:48.811 --> 00:35:50.130
Because all of the things you're saying,

586
00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:54.570
just the blender and the fish and the bus stop and you're an amazing actor.

587
00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.540
You really had me believing that you were excited about this.
Well,

588
00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:05.370
thank you very much.
I know how busy you are,
but uh,
I'm just,
uh,

589
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.590
I adore you.
And,
and your husband and uh,
it was,
uh,

590
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.200
nothing less than an honor to have you come in and chat with me.
Really.

591
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.310
Thanks for having me.
Yeah,

592
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:18.120
this is really uplifting and when I mean that sincerely,
I really do.

593
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.580
You're in very,
very uplifting person.
Thanks.

594
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.400
And we'll agree that no one has to wear makeup at our dinner party.

595
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.140
How we made up.
Okay.

596
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.990
I'm going to have my face tape and I'll be wearing a very obvious red wig.

597
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.340
Now the Conan's out of the room,
you can speak frankly freely.

598
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.090
What is the likelihood that you think you'd be friends with Conan in the future

599
00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:45.990
or after this?
Um,
it's high and they'd be honest.
Yeah,
it's,
hi.

600
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.780
Can I tell you you're the first really?
Well,

601
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:54.170
I like a good challenge and Conan is somewhat of a grump and I like to uplift

602
00:36:55.741 --> 00:36:59.250
the grumps shared goals.
Yeah.
Good.
Thank you very much.

603
00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:00.873
<v 3>Huh?</v>

604
00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:05.891
<v 1>Okay.</v>

605
00:37:05.891 --> 00:37:10.891
It's time for a segment I invented called true or false with SONA,

606
00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.860
most Sassy and he ready to go.
So no,
not really.
You don't like these days?

607
00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:19.870
I hate these.
They're good because they explore the truth of our dynamic.

608
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:23.320
This one is from today.
Oh,
here we go.
Uh,

609
00:37:23.321 --> 00:37:28.290
you know that I am a hard worker.
I was up pretty late last night,
uh,

610
00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:32.470
doing a,
a live show downtown.
Didn't get a ton of sleep,

611
00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.660
try to sleep in a little bit this morning.

612
00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:39.760
Worked out and then I'm rushing to work so that I can get here in time to record

613
00:37:39.761 --> 00:37:41.260
the podcast and I don't want to be late.

614
00:37:41.261 --> 00:37:43.870
I'm a professional and I have our text exchange does.

615
00:37:43.871 --> 00:37:46.870
I'm racing racing to get here.
Hold on.
Don't say anything.

616
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:52.060
This is the exact exchange right from my phone.
I took a screenshot,
I said,

617
00:37:52.061 --> 00:37:53.710
and I was hoping that you would set this up.

618
00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:58.420
I'd like to Conference Matt G and Adam on the way in.
You wrote back,

619
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.400
okay,
I'm making a Bagel in the kitchen.
True or false.

620
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.660
I think we know it's true because I just read it.
Yeah,
it's true.
It's true.
Okay.

621
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.290
You wrote,
you screenshot it,
you have the evidence.
It's true.
I can't even lie.

622
00:38:11.291 --> 00:38:15.880
And also I would,
how does what?
How does what you say follow what?

623
00:38:15.881 --> 00:38:20.750
I said,
how does that,
so how does that follow in any way?
I said,
well,

624
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.341
I got to set up,

625
00:38:21.341 --> 00:38:25.210
we got to set up this conference call with these two guys for the podcast that's

626
00:38:25.211 --> 00:38:27.880
happening in 20 minutes.
And you said,
okay,

627
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:32.380
I'm making a Bagel in the kitchen.
We have a little kitchen here at the show.

628
00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:36.370
Here's what I eat.
I remember sending text,
here's where I was at.

629
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:40.870
You send me that text and I was mid spread on my Bagel.

630
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:41.921
I was like,

631
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:46.900
do I abort this mission right now and go back and set up this conference call or

632
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:48.610
do I finish this,
you know,

633
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.260
take care of my Bagel and then take that with me and then do this conference

634
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:56.440
call.
And I made the executive decision

635
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.540
that it would have taken two minutes,

636
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:04.000
but I didn't want you to think that I was ignoring you.

637
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.420
What I should have done was make my Bagel quietly do it,

638
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:11.830
go back to my desk and just been like,
sure.
Fire away.

639
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.640
I think.
I think it's fair to say that you're too honest with me sometimes.

640
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.820
That's fair to say.
I think it's fair to say that I'll say to you,
uh,
yeah,

641
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.740
things are tight.
I've been working real hard.
The margins are thin.

642
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:29.050
I'm on the run.
I got to get there.
Uh,
helped me with this thing and you'll say,

643
00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.320
I'm making a Bagel and it almost sounds like

644
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.540
a craftier person.
Here's what I am.

645
00:39:39.541 --> 00:39:43.390
And this is a compliment which is all disguised as a slam.

646
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:48.340
You are without guile.
You are not deceptive.
You don't lie.
No.

647
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.120
One of the most honest people I've ever met to a fault.

648
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:55.930
Here's what I hate about this segment is I sent that to you and you didn't

649
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:59.890
respond,
which is never,
it's never good.
You know why?

650
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.300
Cause I knew I had the goods.

651
00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:06.360
You are now reserving just shitting on me for the podcast in a compliment.

652
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:11.590
It did.
Betty your reserve on it.
Now instead of I am,

653
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.500
I take responsibility every time I do something wrong.

654
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:19.210
I think there's nothing wrong with letting you know your text has been received.

655
00:40:19.211 --> 00:40:22.840
Here is my status.
Bagel.

656
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.270
Preparation of status.

657
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.000
I am a Bagel prep stage of my day and when that has been completed,

658
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:34.150
we will address the concerns.
Here's my question.
Are you upset?

659
00:40:34.151 --> 00:40:37.120
Because I didn't drop everything I was doing.
You don't get it.

660
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:41.440
I'm not upset at all.
No,
I'm not upset.

661
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:45.370
I wasn't upset.
I wasn't upset for a second.
When you sent that I got that.

662
00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.160
I looked at what I said,
we've got to set this thing up.

663
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:52.990
Time is tight and you wrote back,
I'm making a Bagel and I thought,
this is great.

664
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.950
I have this for the podcast.
This is amazing.
But I just,

665
00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:01.540
I knew I had you and I knew that I was going to be able to use this.
Uh,
you know,

666
00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:06.040
for the amusement of fathers brought joy to a lot of people.
At least,

667
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.630
at least I don't know how podcasts work,

668
00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:11.620
but I'm guessing in the hundreds of millions I,
oh wow.
These are worldwide,

669
00:41:11.621 --> 00:41:13.240
I think.
And I,
this is going to go huge.

670
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:18.070
I think you enjoy your staff's ineptitude more than anybody else.

671
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.610
I root against my staff really to,

672
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.440
because when my staff fails,

673
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:28.530
I love making fun of them more than I like things going well at the show.

674
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:32.470
I would rather any project we're working on,

675
00:41:32.471 --> 00:41:35.150
whether it's the show or the podcast or anything,

676
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.450
I would rather have it not be as good.

677
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:44.050
But I catch staff members making a mistake and I get to have fun with it.

678
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.230
Yeah.
That is my insanity.
I love it.

679
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:52.970
I actively root against everyone who works for me.
As your new producer,

680
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:57.260
do you know how nervous this thing?
Oh,
I can't believe you didn't,

681
00:41:57.261 --> 00:42:00.410
they didn't warn you about me?
No,
not really,
but I got the,

682
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.610
I got it pretty quickly I think.
Yeah.
It's uh,

683
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:08.450
it looked this morning we were talking on the phone and we were pitching out

684
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:13.340
some ideas and uh,
if there was one I didn't really love you hung up.

685
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:17.600
I didn't hang up.
I didn't hang up,
but I can't,

686
00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:18.860
you tell I'm joyous.

687
00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.390
I have a lot of energy when I hear something I don't like and I love to go on a

688
00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:27.470
long,
long,
I would say not a cruel but a long riff.

689
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.100
You're pure shot in Freud.
Yeah,
right.
Just exactly.

690
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.520
I just shot him.
Freud is my favorite German sausage.

691
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.650
It's a rooting for,

692
00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:41.360
but it's crazy thing is that I do it with,

693
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.970
everyone here is working to help me and I actually,

694
00:42:46.971 --> 00:42:49.490
I'm in and I really do love the people I work with.

695
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:53.550
I am being as honest as I can be.
I love the people I work with.
I don't know.

696
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:59.720
That was a blanket statement.
I love Sona blaze in the room.
Uh,
there's,

697
00:42:59.721 --> 00:43:02.270
well I don't know some of these other guys.
I'm going to be honest with you.

698
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:06.280
I don't know who you creeping around.
Who are you,
John?

699
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:09.680
I know John's only been with me for like eight years.
You've gotta be in John,

700
00:43:09.681 --> 00:43:14.030
you've got to be in like 15 years before you in the club.
But the point is,

701
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.070
I really do love the people I work with.

702
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.040
I think I'm a good boss in in a lot of ways,

703
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:24.310
but the insane thing about me is the joy I take in things going wrong and even

704
00:43:26.571 --> 00:43:30.350
if it hurts the overall,
the overall endeavor,

705
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.310
I don't understand.
Someone helped me.
I don't either.

706
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.150
How many times a day would you say in the time that you've known me?

707
00:43:38.151 --> 00:43:40.400
I've said out loud to a room full of people.

708
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.840
Someone please take me to the hospital.
Oh,
I think you see it every 20 minutes.

709
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.370
Someone please take him to the hospital and,
and,
and because you're all,

710
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.720
you're all making a living off of my sickness.
Well,
how dare you.

711
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.570
What do you,
well,
the pay will listen,
this thing's going to explode.
All right.

712
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.540
And when it does,
you are going to be dressed like a pimp.
You know?

713
00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:07.040
Right now you're in your whatever,
your Los Filez cool hip.

714
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.460
I don't live in Los Felix.
I don't know.
I don't want to know where you live.

715
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.500
You're wearing that shirt.
That's like maybe I'm a prospect or,
but maybe also I,

716
00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.630
I worked for podcast,

717
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:22.540
I mentioned that you have a fob of I think,
who is that?
It's a five.

718
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:27.050
It's a yes,
it's,
this is,
um,
I love this.
This is,
uh,

719
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:30.860
I was in Mexico City.
We shot a show there and I wanted to go see the home.

720
00:44:30.861 --> 00:44:35.220
Were Trotsky got an ice pick task?
Yeah.
So I got this when I was there.

721
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:36.240
There's a gift shop.

722
00:44:36.241 --> 00:44:39.800
You're the pendant broach of Trotsky hanging off your pocket.
Right.

723
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.330
Cause I was there.
I earned it.
It's not something I ordered.

724
00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:47.331
Like you want EPA to try and get points when I'm getting my Mocha Chai Chapo,

725
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.570
this I got,
because I'm the only late night host,

726
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:56.630
maybe the only entertainer in America who's ever gone to the home.

727
00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.180
We're Trotsky was murdered.
And not only that,

728
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:04.260
I then went to the gift shop and bought this little pendant that has a picture

729
00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:05.094
of Trotsky.

730
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:08.850
And when my favorite thing is that I've had more than one person walk up and go

731
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:10.930
point to it and go,
oh,
I love Bhorat too.

732
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.010
They think it's a bore at Penn.

733
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.420
I thought it was a bit from like a prop from UB segment on your show,

734
00:45:17.421 --> 00:45:21.330
or you played your own ancestors or something.
No,
no,
no.
That's Trotsky.
Trotsky.

735
00:45:21.331 --> 00:45:21.840
Uh,

736
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.620
for those of you listening who don't know will quickly become a history podcast.

737
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.330
Trotsky,
uh,
was one of the founders of the revolution,
the Russian revolution,

738
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.840
uh,
with Lennon and s people like stolen.

739
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.690
And then of course when Stalin took power,
Trotsky was out.

740
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:41.220
So Trotsky had to run away and he ran away and he ran all the way to Mexico City

741
00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:45.660
and he thought he was safe,
but Stalin doesn't give up on a grudge.

742
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:49.260
So we sent a guy with an ice pick.
It's very Russian.
Yeah.

743
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.610
Russian or your husband is part Russian?
No,
no,

744
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:58.260
he's Armenian.
He grew up in the Soviet Union.
Right.
So he speaks Russian.
Yeah.

745
00:45:58.261 --> 00:46:02.070
But he also has a certain Russian sensibility because he grew up in the Russian

746
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.820
Soviet system.
That's true.
That's all I meant by that.
Yeah,
no,
that's very true.

747
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:09.900
Here's the interesting thing.
You like going places where people died.
Yeah.
I,

748
00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:14.700
I love it.
When you travel,
you're like,
that's where so and so,
uh,
you know,

749
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:18.510
was bashed in the head with a baseball bat.
Let's go to that house.

750
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:21.320
I go to those places,
the way other people go to Disneyland.
I know.

751
00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:25.710
Is that a real place?
Like you went to the,
uh,
Hogan's Heroes Guy's house?

752
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.830
I haven't been to his house.
It wasn't a house by the rain.
First of all.

753
00:46:28.831 --> 00:46:32.160
Let's get our facts straight.
Sorry.
Okay.
It's apartment.

754
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:38.180
It was Bob crane who played Hogan heroes at the time was doing regional theater

755
00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.770
and he was staying in sort of the equivalent of kind of a hotel,

756
00:46:43.771 --> 00:46:48.000
but kind of a weekly apartment sort of place.
I apologize.
Yeah,
that's all right.

757
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.480
And uh,
yeah,
he was a legend in his room,
most likely.

758
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:56.040
And I'm risking a lawsuit here by his best friend at the time,
uh,

759
00:46:56.041 --> 00:47:00.480
who escaped prosecution.
Uh,
what's not talk about that anymore.

760
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.110
I haven't been there.
I haven't made the pilgrimage,
uh,

761
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:08.100
to go to Arizona and see that,
uh,
that hotel that's on my list though.

762
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:12.850
I'll get there.
I want to make that a family pilgrimage.
I'm like,
God,

763
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:15.570
the whole family to go.
I don't know if you want to talk about this.

764
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.700
When I first started working for you,

765
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:21.780
I remember I had to drive you home and we drove by the house where Sharon Tate

766
00:47:21.781 --> 00:47:24.060
was murdered and you can't drive past that house.

767
00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:28.820
You've got to drive all the way up.
That's what I feel is right.
No,
no.

768
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.820
Well now you know.
You just try to throw it misinformation.
I might be.
I'll wait.

769
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:36.400
That's your job.
That's your job.
I think you're thinking of the murder house,

770
00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:41.220
the murder house,
Polanski places.
Plasty places,
I guess actually,
yeah,

771
00:47:41.221 --> 00:47:44.570
at the top of a,
I think it's LC yellow.
It is.
He'll see yellow.
Sorry,

772
00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:49.560
just to kind of thing I had in my head.
It's ELC yellow.
That's all right.
Oh,

773
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:54.180
how's that Bagel?
I just love correcting you.
Yeah.
Okay.

774
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.780
Well you showed me.
I said l instead of ill,
you made a big old while.
Rome burned.

775
00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:02.850
He just needed to go on a conference call.

776
00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.320
All right.
We're going to get some stuff straight here.
Poorly.

777
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.690
Gourley you've got to get it together.

778
00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:16.050
You're going to interject things like the house where Bob Crane was killed,

779
00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:21.880
which is incorrect.
Or if you're going to interject,
uh,
that,

780
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.000
uh,
oh yeah,
the Sharon Tate Polanski House that's in,

781
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.020
in Los filets incorrect.
I mean,

782
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:32.860
that's going to be a stick in the spoke of the wheel.

783
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.960
That is the bicycle that is this podcast.

784
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:40.440
The other murders were in Litchfield is gotta be you're thinking you're about

785
00:48:40.811 --> 00:48:45.340
Labianca.
Yeah.
And I appreciate the fact checking.
I do.
I think,
and I born,

786
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:46.870
I didn't want to have a harsh tone.

787
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:51.040
I'm tough on you because I see great potential.
Thank you.
That means a lot.

788
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.820
I appreciate it.
I really do think that one day,
uh,

789
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:57.160
I think you're going to go on to great things and that's why Burgess Meredith

790
00:48:57.161 --> 00:49:02.110
was tough.
Uh,
you know the coat to the,
what's his name?
Uh,

791
00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:05.560
Mickey.
Thank you.
See Mickey.
Yeah,

792
00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:10.190
the trainer was tough on rock.
I got that right.
Yeah,
no.

793
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.540
Oh,
he's Mickey.
Wait,
I'm still alone.

794
00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:20.160
I'm sorry.
You're talking about,
you're tough on him.
He's still on.
He's rocky.

795
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:22.780
Oh No.
This is a bad allergy then he can't be rocky.
No,

796
00:49:22.781 --> 00:49:26.610
I you just want to be rocked.
Allergy.
Allergy.

797
00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.190
A bad allergy.
Did I say,
I think you did.

798
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.260
They think you think I said lately.

799
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:35.710
I've said lately I'm worried that I have something wrong with my brain because
I,

800
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.100
I'm very good at saying the right word and lately the right word isn't coming

801
00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:43.630
out.
This podcast may turn out to be a chronicle of my decline.
Well,

802
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:47.800
it seems like we're all in some way each other's Mickey and Stallone and Miyagi

803
00:49:47.801 --> 00:49:50.770
and Daniel and it's going to be interesting to see where this goes.

804
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:55.690
I refuse to accept that.
Really?
Yes.
I will not be Mickey to your Stallone.

805
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.680
I am Stallone.
Do you think I'm like training and mentoring you?

806
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:03.130
I mean,
I'll take it,
but it seems like you don't know where that puts you.

807
00:50:03.131 --> 00:50:07.960
I don't care.
I'm that I'm his drunk buddy.
Oh,
you know who you are.
Yes.

808
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:13.090
You're Burt young.
Very young.
You're young.
You're a Talia Shire.

809
00:50:13.091 --> 00:50:15.220
His brother.
That's right.
You're an alcoholic.

810
00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:18.430
That feels right and a bully and you work in a meat packing plant that feels bad

811
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:20.590
and I am still alone,

812
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.380
sculpted it Donnis one of the biggest stars of the seventies eighties nineties

813
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.110
and then think,
I don't know what he's doing now.
Do you need to go to a hospital?

814
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.380
I would like to go to a hospital.
Right.
Let's go.
I want a good television.
Oh,

815
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:33.621
good.

816
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:38.480
Flat screen and I want pudding and I want to stay there for two weeks and I want

817
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:43.280
it to be a good bed.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Let's take you to the hospital.

Hi,</v>

834
00:51:52.821 --> 00:51:57.680
I'm Alan Alda and I'm a guest on Gilbert Godfried.
Amazing colossal podcast.

835
00:51:57.681 --> 00:52:01.490
You got to listen to this.
They made me laugh and left like this.

836
00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:11.170
You were not prepared for what a big star you would come after that.

837
00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.830
How's that great story about how your face was more recognized to those students

838
00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:16.780
than Lincoln's?
Isn't that weird?

839
00:52:16.781 --> 00:52:21.130
Bizarre and Lincoln [inaudible] dig tried in my face and Lincoln's face and they

840
00:52:21.131 --> 00:52:24.400
showed it to school children at and during those years,

841
00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:27.310
they recognize me more easily than Lincoln.

842
00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:29.500
And that's hard to believe because he had his own penny.

843
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:35.240
Join Gilbert Frank and their guests,
Alan Alda this Monday,

844
00:52:35.241 --> 00:52:36.770
wherever you listen to podcasts.
