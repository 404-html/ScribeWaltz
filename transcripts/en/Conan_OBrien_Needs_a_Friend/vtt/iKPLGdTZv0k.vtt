1
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.620
I would not describe myself as a businessman.
No,

2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.840
you're not terrible with that stuff.
But if I did have a business,

3
00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:13.580
I'd want to be a good businessman.
And so I would probably use campaign monitor.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.280
You know why?

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.280
Why cause campaign monitor is this company a that allows you to,

6
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.540
uh,
send mass emails to all of your customers.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.140
It gives you useful tools like drag and drop.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.520
It's helps you create personal relational emails.

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.450

17
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.530
Ask me what's on my mind.
Sona,
what's on your mind?

18
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:12.590
Conan was 70 whole food sourced ingredients.

Athletic Greens is the best of the best in all in one whole food supplements.

20
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.080
That's what's on my mind.
It's a powder.
It comes with this whole kit.

21
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.890
You can mix this powder and water.
I'd put it in a,
you know,

22
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:29.720
a little vodka in there.
Maybe you know,
defeats the purpose.
No,
it doesn't.

23
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.220
It's for nutrition.

24
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:35.240
So why can't you have nutritious a alcoholic beverage before he go to sleep?

25
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.710
All I'm saying is you do with this powder what you will,

32
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.560
I was surprised at how quickly it dissolved.
I always look at patterns.

33
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.170
Say you're dissolving too slowly.
This one before I got to your design.

34
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.630
It was already dissolved.
That's a fast dissolving powder faster than I expected.

35
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.650
Hi,
my name is Mark Marin

36
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.400
and I feel um,
nervous about being Conan O'brien's friends.

37
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.160
Hello there.
And welcome to Conan O'brien needs a friend.
Pretty simple idea.

38
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:54.370
This is the show where I Conan O'brien talk to people.

39
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.060
A lot of them I've known for many years.
They've been on my show many times.

40
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.100
I'm just trying to find could we be real

41
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.150
<v 2>friends,
not just on the air talk,
show pals,
but real friends.</v>

42
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.100
And I'm aided in my quest by my trusty assistant sona most [inaudible].

43
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.930
Hello.
I am Don Quixote and you are my son show panzer.
Okay.

44
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.910
I am Batman.
And you're my Robin.
Okay.
Right.
I Guess Fair?

45
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.630
Sure.
Yeah,
I don't,
Robin's not as,
he's not cool.

46
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:27.610
He's not interesting.
You're not brooding like Batman,
but I'll,
I'll take it.
Yeah,

47
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.230
no,
you're,
you're definitely,
he's chipper you.
Definitely.
Robin,

48
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.290
maybe you're Robin and I'm back.
You think you're Batman?

49
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.840
I think I'm pretty cool.
I do.
Okay.
It's weird,
but okay.

50
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.760
I guess I'm Robin to your Batman Cause I think of Robin as Batman's assistant.

51
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.410
The way you're my assistant.
Yeah.
But I'm going more by personality.

52
00:03:47.411 --> 00:03:52.150
Like Batman is cool and Robin is like not as cool.
Okay.

53
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:53.710
We'll talk about that later.
Okay.

54
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.390
Also aided by my producer Matt Gorley.
Matt,

55
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:01.260
you do all kinds of stuff and I don't understand it.
Uh,

56
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.010
you put things through filters,
you touched various buttons.
You have levels.
Uh,

57
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:10.860
what do you do?
I'm the Alfred the Butler of this.
Oh,
your outfit?
Yeah,

58
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.160
I'm living there in the podcast cave.
Just keeping things wearing a Tux,

59
00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:16.240
keeping things tidy.

60
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.990
So your Alfred Sona is Batman and I am a Robin.
Yes.

61
00:04:20.991 --> 00:04:24.790
It seems to be doing a lot more work than Batman,
that's for sure.
Yes.

62
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.050
In this context.
Yes.
Well,
what a weird,
uh,

63
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.910
Tria we are,
but we're working together on this quest to find friends.

64
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:36.340
Today we're going to talk to someone I've known for a really long time,

65
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:37.840
Mark Marin.
Uh,

66
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.870
mark has been struggling in the podcast space and maybe this will give him a

67
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:45.190
little bit of a boost.
He could use it.

68
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

69
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.690
<v 2>Anyway,
I'm thrilled he's here.
Mark Marin,</v>

70
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.290
<v 3>why would I make you nervous?
Well,
yeah,</v>

71
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.050
I think you're relatively nervous and I'm kind of a guide that has limited

72
00:05:03.051 --> 00:05:06.590
boundaries.
So I pick up on your anxiety.
You pick up on my side.
Yeah.

73
00:05:06.591 --> 00:05:10.520
You're making me yelling or ready because every time that you have come on the

74
00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:14.030
show.
Yeah.
And it's been 25 years.
Yeah.
Just coming on the show.

75
00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:17.240
I think you've been on the show more than anyone else next to Al Roker.
Yeah.

76
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.570
You and you're in the,
you're in the Al Roker League,
so congratulations.

77
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:24.650
He's a lot more happy than me whenever you're on the show and after all these

78
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.680
years,
you're saying that I make you nervous?
A little.
Yeah,

79
00:05:27.681 --> 00:05:30.830
but not like not in the way where I'm sort of like a,

80
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.520
I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this or if he likes me or something.

81
00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:38.960
It's just that you're pretty amped.
So I got it.
I got to get amped and uh,

82
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.840
sometimes when I get amped it,
you know,
it's hit or miss with me.

83
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.630
But with Roker your do you put that on me?

84
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.830
You're putting your whole personality on me.
You're a neurotic guy.

85
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.450
You're an anxious guy.
Yes.
You are not a settled zen guy.
That's right.

86
00:05:53.451 --> 00:05:57.110
Suddenly you're,
you're here saying,
yeah,
I'm that way because of you Conan.
I no,

87
00:05:57.111 --> 00:06:00.980
I'm just saying you that you amp it up.
Well,
I amp it up.
I think I'm very calm.

88
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.350
I'm a very calm guy.
Even how you say calm is making me anxious.
SONA.

89
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.830
Yes.
Am I calling that?
I don't know.
I'm not so now no.
Alright.

90
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.740
Are you calm?
You would just say I'm a calm centered.
No,

91
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.200
I would not say you're a car.
I think you're pretty,
I agree with mark.

92
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.030
I'm sorry.
I am.
I'm sorry.
I'm tightly wound.
Yeah,
I think you are.

93
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.160
You should,
uh,
well that was nice.

94
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:28.470
But maybe no more of you during this conversation.
Do you remember?
Um,

95
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.900
one of the first times I have to be honest that I think that I deserve,

96
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:35.790
I should be,
even though me and Al Roker have,
uh,

97
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.880
been on roughly the same amount of times,

98
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:41.330
maybe him a little more is that he has this built in thing every,

99
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.290
every other or every two appearances with Roker you could go like,
wow,

100
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:50.020
you lost the weight.
See with me fresh every time.
Yes.
Yeah.
You,

101
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.820
I have to come up with a new idea every single time I talk.
Well,

102
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:57.410
you kind of wait for me to,
uh,
to kind of start it awkwardly.
Yes.
I know.

103
00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:58.820
I never understood why that happened though,

104
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:01.040
even though it became a thing with us.
I do want to understand why.

105
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:04.120
Here's the brilliant thing about you.
There are many brilliant things,
but um,

106
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.910
that was just a kind of like,
I like it.
Here's what is amazing about you.

107
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.890
25 years.
You've been on so many times and every time you come out,

108
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.300
every time you'd come out,

109
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.920
and this is back way before WTF way before you were Mark Marin,

110
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:20.300
the podcast God,

111
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.400
the Mark Merrett before I became a middle level celebrity that half the people

112
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:29.390
knew you were hot,
you were above mid level.
You are high,
mid level.
Yes.

113
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.360
I'll take it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Long before all that,

114
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:35.780
you would come on my show do panel and you would always dig a hole.

115
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.890
You would dig a hole in front of the audience.
I know,
but you would dig a hole.

116
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:44.891
The audience would turn on you and you would always dig your way out.

117
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.460
I know,
and I don't know how you did it.
Well,
I mean that's the way I work.

118
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:51.570
That's how I create,
but I never planned it.

119
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.210
I always thought when I got out there,

120
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:57.050
whatever my idea was to start the thing with was just going to nail it.

121
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.380
Every time.
I'm amazed.
I get out there,
see,

122
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:03.740
I don't know if it's my energy or my reacting to your energy as we've already

123
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:06.350
established where I,
if it's a tone thing,

124
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.170
but I put the first thing out and then nothing,

125
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.590
and then you look at me and then it's like,
yeah,
you did it again.

126
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.840
And then I got to look at the audience.
Go Really?
And then that then yes,

127
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:21.020
but you will always turn on the audience and you would acknowledge that you

128
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:24.230
would start it badly and you would do this every scene,
every time.

129
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.720
And I'm telling people out there listening to this,

130
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.810
you can go online and look up Mark Marin appearance from the beginning,

131
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:34.340
from 1993 almost to the present.
It's always the same.

132
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.780
You go out,
you say something,
you shouldn't say,
uh,
we planned it.

133
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.790
Maybe we didn't.
Maybe that was my,
no,
you would freestyle,

134
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.150
freestyle and you would say,
you know,
the Nazis give him some credit for,

135
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:51.410
and then bang,
the Nazis were antiabortion.
Right.
Something like that

136
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.910
now.
Yeah.
That was something like that.
You know,
they,
Hitler built the Autobahn.

137
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.610
That's a good way to get around it.
Well,
it would have been the other way.

138
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:01.070
It would have been the Nazis were pro abortion.

139
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.980
Like there was a good thing about the Nazis.
You just oils pro choice.

140
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.450
You just don't know if it's true.

141
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:10.140
But I'm just trying to make an example and now I just did what I did on the
show.

142
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.410
Everyone out there.
Thanks.
I just did it again.
This is you.

143
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.980
What you are antiabortion that's what they think right now.

144
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:19.740
Just hearing that quip.
No,
that was not the point of it.
See,

145
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:20.670
this is how it happens.

146
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:24.690
See the dynamic that's unfolding and then you have to save me and then I can get

147
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:28.650
back on track.
That's why it happens.
So you can save me so you can look good.

148
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.470
I'm going to tell you something.
What I,
uh,
been been,

149
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:35.250
been very happy for you because the podcast exploded.

150
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:38.040
You are on the Mount Rushmore of podcasts.

151
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:42.930
It's your face chiseled into a mountain next to Ira Glass next to Sarah
Canaigre.

152
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.340
Uh,
I mean these are,
this is huge.
I restarted,
he was a radio guy first.

153
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:52.341
They just got it loaded up his radio show onto the podcast platform and he found

154
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:55.020
success because he already had it.

155
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.690
I would like him to be removed from that mountain weight.

156
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.980
You're throwing shade at Ira Glass.
Oh hell y'all throw shade.
I glass.
Okay.

157
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.790
How can you just talk like that all the time and act like it's going to be good

158
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:09.980
for 30 years anyways?
No,
I love IRA.
No you don't.
You know,
he'd feel you did it.

159
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.250
You know you have some resentment towards IRA glass is not a good time for me.

160
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:18.900
He started in radio and then just shifted over into potty.
He didn't shift.

161
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:20.580
They just put his radio show on there.
Yeah.

162
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.690
And so you really helped develop this format.
Exactly.

163
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:29.020
You helped create this format.
Yeah.
No,
you,
you are a giant in the podcast.

164
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.140
Yeah,
I'd say that like on the mountain.
Oh,
a little,

165
00:10:33.141 --> 00:10:37.830
a little more hiking up to me from where I was noses.
Okay.

166
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.280
That's,
yeah.
No,
no.
Let me say this more clearly.

167
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.030
Irs sort of towards the bottom of the mountain.
He's how you access the mountain.

168
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.730
You step over his face to then start climbing the mountain.

169
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:50.550
Then when you get to the top,
there you are,
Mark Marin.

170
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.860
I would say that everybody who like I think what I ever did and what Pete,

171
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.810
what NPR has done,

172
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:58.830
what everyone's done with podcasting is anything that brings people to the

173
00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:01.530
medium to getting it to the,
to the access it.

174
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.140
Cause there's a whole generation of people to this day,

175
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.570
my father who I think is lying,

176
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.670
can't figure out how to listen to one of my shows.
But that's a whole other,

177
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.720
you know,
if we want to talk about that,
there's,

178
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.890
we're going to have to get some of these people out of here.
So why?

179
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.580
Because there's a personal and I wanted it,
you know,
that's what you do.

180
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.510
I know him and you go d sometime you go deep and you get inside.

181
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.990
I'm not going to do that on this point and I'm surely,
but uh,
but no,

182
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:28.650
I'm happy for anybody who brings people to the medium so they have choices.
Okay,

183
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.670
well diplomatic and I love IRA.
I've listened to his show several times.

184
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:34.470
I get moved.
It's always a good story.

185
00:11:34.471 --> 00:11:37.740
You never know where it's going is obviously we created something amazing,

186
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.800
but it didn't start as a podcast.
Yeah.
I have respect for him.
Sure.

187
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.090
You ended with the passive aggressive resentment.
Okay,
here's what I want to say.

188
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.333
Yes,

189
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.480
you have this podcast and I had such respect for your podcast and I went on your

190
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:54.790
podcast and it's revered at that for that reason,

191
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.460
and there were many people that said to me,
cone,
and you should have a podcast.

192
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.900
You have a quick agile mind.
You have a smooth,
uh,
speaking voice,

193
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.070
you should have a podcast.
And I said,
no,
I won't do it because I have a TV show.

194
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:11.170
Mark has the podcast.
Then you betrayed me.
God,
listen,

195
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.760
you got Marin,
the TV show.
Yeah.
Okay.
That wasn't enough for you then glow.
Right.

196
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.670
Okay.
Yeah.
You have two TV shows in a podcast.

197
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.620
That is why I'm starting this podcast out of spite.
Out of spite.

198
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.810
Why should you have two TV shows in a podcast in me?
Just a TV show.

199
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.520
Yeah.
No,
I get that.
And I,
and I think,
uh,
all right.
Checkmate.
I guess.
Yeah.

200
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:36.820
I guess I win this round on that buddy.
I guess you got in at the right time.

201
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:40.000
There's only 90,000 podcasts.
Is that true?

202
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:41.410
I was told there were very few of these.

203
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.430
I was told by my people that this timing is perfect.
Right?
Right.

204
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.800
At the point where people have had enough of podcast,
you're launching one.

205
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:49.750
I think that's great.

206
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.640
I was told I was assured by my people that there was you and like one other and

207
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:55.474
that was it.

208
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.890
Just the 10 on now on a high tunes that are listed in the top 10,

209
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:04.690
that's the only ones that exist.
Don't ever scroll below that.
Uh,
this is news.

210
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.400
This is news to me.
You're doing a great job already.
Listen.
Yeah,
I,
I,

211
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.060
I respect you.
You make you a master at this format.
Yeah.
What's your advice?

212
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:15.700
Is there anything you could tell me about a podcast?

213
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.010
Are there things I should avoid or,
or,

214
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.490
or there are things I should be doing or how do you prepare?
Give me some advice.

215
00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:23.700
We've been friends a long,
well not friends,
but we've known.

216
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.740
Do you remember the advice I gave you?
Right.

217
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.030
And like the first year of your show,
like one of my first appearances,

218
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.800
it was so funny cause I was in a different place in my life there.
And uh,

219
00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.520
and I told you before I go on,

220
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.140
I told you my mantra,

221
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.070
which was hide the hate and you sort of took that with your high day by the Hay.

222
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:49.220
Well that's also a I,
that's a very Irish Catholic thing.
We hide the hate.

223
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.470
If you hate someone,
you tell everyone but that person that you hate them,

224
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:59.060
but you never tell that hide the hate and display the shame.
Right.

225
00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:03.170
That's the Irish Catholic,
right?
Right.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh,
advice for podcasting.

226
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.550
I don't know.
For me,
I don't,
I I prepare like my,
I see your notes,

227
00:14:07.551 --> 00:14:09.860
my notes look more like just your handwritten ones.

228
00:14:09.861 --> 00:14:12.110
There's never any type things with me.

229
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:17.150
And I usually just do bullet points or scattered 'em I do almost like a weird

230
00:14:17.151 --> 00:14:20.300
collage of bits and pieces I want to know about.

231
00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:23.030
So it starts to look like the inside of my brain.

232
00:14:23.031 --> 00:14:27.440
So I don't have any ordered way of,
of sort of asking questions.

233
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.010
I just have a bunch of ideas about the person or bits.

234
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.960
Like if somebody cured cancer,
you don't want to miss that one.

235
00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.460
You should probably involve that in the conversation.
Like I tried to,

236
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.100
big achievements or things are known for.

237
00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.940
I'll throw that on the list I'm looking through here for you brought up podcast

238
00:14:43.941 --> 00:14:47.680
and to answer a lot of Conan's.
He already did it.
You did it naturally.

239
00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:52.610
Want us say you didn't see,
you don't have any curing cancer and,
no.
Let's see.

240
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.330
Yeah.
It says here you got a Latin grammy.
Yeah.
See that's,
this is good.

241
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:59.690
Podcasting.
You're not prepared.
It's a human moment.
You're looking for your Pi,

242
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.660
your pages.
I,
there's a rough edge to it.

243
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.140
Like a lot of times you heard my neighbor working on his yard.

244
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.890
Occasionally people would knock on the door sometimes.
When Andy Richter was on,

245
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:12.590
that was,
uh,
that was what got me to get an air conditioner.

246
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.720
Like Andy came on and it was summer and it was in the garage and I had not put a

247
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:20.690
unit in the window yet.
And Andy almost died.

248
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.790
I don't know if he's talked about that publicly,

249
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.980
but I'd never seen a person sweat more than that.

250
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.730
And after that I'd got an air conditioner at Helms had a cat allergy.

251
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.190
I didn't think that the cats would trans,
you know,

252
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:35.930
there was no cat ever in the garage,
but he was wheezing a 40 minutes in.

253
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.480
And uh,
I needed an hour.
So it was,
uh,

254
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.340
it was hard to listen to Ed wheeze and watch his throat type.

255
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.690
Now you should know because you're carrying a lot of guilt here and these are

256
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.870
things we should do.
I've got an air purifier is what I'm saying.

257
00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:51.580
And that's what got me to do that someone did in Andy Richter sweats and a snow

258
00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:53.230
storm,
you should know that he had good,

259
00:15:53.231 --> 00:15:57.940
and number two was Ed Helms has tuberculosis.
Oh my God.
Yes.
I don't know bad any.

260
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:02.000
No.
Great loves cats.
So it was not allergic to cats.
He played Banjo I think,

261
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:06.380
and he was like,
it was a 10 Helms played banjo.
I believe so.
Am I making that up?

262
00:16:06.381 --> 00:16:10.310
No,
it does play Banjo.
That's what he does.
That's his thing is he plays Banjo.

263
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.950
He did.
He played some Banjo.
My recollection from Steve Martin,

264
00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:15.860
I believe that's all Steve does now.
Right?

265
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:18.320
Apparently I wanted to have him on the show,
but he was like,

266
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:21.140
only if we only talk about Banjo and I'm like not doing that.

267
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:26.150
You said no to Steve Martin.
I did.
No,
you don't do that.
I did.
Wait a minute.
What?

268
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.800
No,
you say yes to Steve Martin.

269
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:31.190
He let him do what he wants to do and then do I need to get it in?
Exactly.

270
00:16:31.191 --> 00:16:33.290
I know I know the game,
but he like he,

271
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.660
there's something about him that intimidates me.

272
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:38.060
There's a few people that I have on.
I don't think it's ever going to happen,

273
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.040
Steve.
I think it would have a good conversation with,

274
00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:43.340
but he was just in this period where he had written a book about stand up and

275
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:44.121
that was the end of it.

276
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:47.360
Now it was all about Banjo and I got nothing against Banjo.
But like,

277
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:48.591
then I got to fight.

278
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:51.350
Then I got to have a Steve Martin who seems a little depressed.
Anyways,

279
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.390
we're talking about Banjo and then I go like,

280
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.100
when you first got on stage as a standup,
he's like,
like,

281
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.500
I didn't want to deal with that.
Usually what happens with older artists,

282
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:04.720
I've found like,
let's take Roger Waters for example,
from pink Floyd.
Yeah.

283
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.550
Some of these guys,
they,
they're out promoting a record,

284
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:11.780
which is sometimes the only way I can get them.
And he gets in there,
he's like,

285
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:14.930
look,
I don't want to talk about pink Floyd.
And I'm like,
Oh,
Christ.
All right.

286
00:17:14.931 --> 00:17:17.930
So this happens all the time on my show.
Yeah.

287
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.680
I don't want to talk about the only thing I'm known for.
Right.

288
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.330
And then he gets only thing.
And you've only got like 11 minutes.
Yeah.
And the,

289
00:17:24.331 --> 00:17:28.910
so it's like Eli Whitney invented no,
no cotton.
And then he comes on.

290
00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:32.810
And just before,
uh,
just one thing,
uh,
uh,
it was just not,

291
00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:37.280
talk about the cotton from cotton.
Anybody knows about you,
Eli?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

292
00:17:37.281 --> 00:17:41.570
no.
I'm working on something new.
It's a shoe.
No one cares.

293
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:46.160
No one cares about your shoe.
He cotton shoe.
You know,
I've had so many,

294
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.280
so many times and it's the publicist,
people have publicists,

295
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.810
publicists always says first line of defense,
you know the publicist.
Oh he says,

296
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:58.780
you know that thing that's really funny that my client was going to say that

297
00:17:58.781 --> 00:18:03.781
it's hilarious and it's going to totally kill and it's going to go viral.

298
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.370
We're killing that cause we're going in a different direction.

299
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.360
They're going to talk about linoleum.
Exactly.
Well No,
with Roger,

300
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:13.020
what ultimately happens is you realize that they do want to talk about it cause

301
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:14.880
they've been talking about it their whole life.

302
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.840
And for some reason they just think that that,

303
00:18:17.841 --> 00:18:21.300
that the new thing they're doing is the best thing they've ever done because

304
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:25.290
they have to.
Yes.
And you know,
you just work it around and like within seconds,

305
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.830
uh,
you know,
Roger Waters was throwing David Gilmore under the bus and I'm like,

306
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:30.770
I didn't even ask for this.
Right.
Uh,

307
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.970
did you find him to be a little bit of a sour ball?
He's angry guy.
Yeah.

308
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.160
That's the same thing.
Yes.

309
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:40.190
I interviewed him once and he was incredibly sour and tense period.

310
00:18:40.451 --> 00:18:45.270
Then daddy's stuff.
Yeah,
he's sour.
Was No fun to talk to.

311
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.760
I'll throw him under the bus.
I don't care.
I'm not going to run into him again.

312
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.320
And so I,
yeah,
but I won't recognize him.
Uh,

313
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.750
and no one does.
That's one of the problems.

314
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:56.280
Could you recognize any of pink Floyd?

315
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.700
Almost every band that you've liked their entire life you would recognize but

316
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:02.640
like him?
Yeah,
I don't,
you wouldn't recognize David going out on the street.

317
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.250
What'd you,
I might ask him.
I don't even know what the drummer's name is.

318
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.140
And they're a huge band.
Isn't that weird?

319
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.640
It's weird that we don't know their faces,

320
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.360
but I want to throw Roger Waters under the bus because he was a sour ball.

321
00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.370
And then we go to commercial and you know,

322
00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:16.980
in commercial that's usually when most guests,

323
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:21.060
there's a friendly has changed and out of a lineup you always say to lean over

324
00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:24.270
and go like,
that was pretty good.
Right?
That was okay.
That's what you always do.

325
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.270
Cause that was,
I was,
I wonder if you're listening dude.
Was that okay?

326
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.870
Was that good?
What did you think?
Was that okay?
And,
and it's always like,
I,
okay,

327
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:35.100
I got to take care of mark here.
Yeah,
exactly.
But the guests,
so we throw it,

328
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.840
we throw to commercial,
but they pay back.

329
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.460
That band's playing and Roger Waters turns to me and he goes,
that's it.

330
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.060
And I said,
uh,
yeah,
that,
that was the end of the interview when he went,

331
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.140
then this is me leaving and he stood up and walked out.
Oh.

332
00:19:48.141 --> 00:19:51.120
So I see why you have the prize.
What is that?
What is that?

333
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:54.300
That's a guy that got a,
you know,
tricked into doing your show.

334
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.090
Didn't really want to do it to begin with.
I think he thought he was doing Alan.

335
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.200
I don't know.
I have people I can look like Ellen from a distance,

336
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.330
but I find that with these guys,
those guys,
those older dude,

337
00:20:04.331 --> 00:20:08.640
especially musicians like I,
but some of them accept it.
Like Neil Young,

338
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.100
I didn't know was a difficult interview.

339
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.260
No one told me I should have done some homework.
Right.

340
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.650
So now I've got to pull teeth and thank God he tried to figure out

341
00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:19.860
mathematically how many nicotine lozenge as I do and he got a real kick out of

342
00:20:19.861 --> 00:20:22.860
the equation and we were kind of rolling from there.

343
00:20:22.861 --> 00:20:25.170
It turned out to be good interview.
That's the key to podcasting.

344
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.940
Don't plan the conversation,
don't plan a conversation.
And Nicotine Lozenge.

345
00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:32.790
I was off them for a while.
I'm back on him.
We don't need to talk about it.
Oh,

346
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.930
when someone says don't talk about it,
I say let's talk about it.
Oh well yeah,

347
00:20:36.931 --> 00:20:40.080
it's just a cycle with me.
I got off,
I'm like,
I haven't smoked a cigarette.

348
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:42.210
And like over decades,
it's been a long time.

349
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:46.050
I was on a nicotine Los Angeles for a long time,
uh,
because I enjoy them.

350
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.440
And then I found,
you know,

351
00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:50.770
dipping and get just getting any nicotine anyway I could,
and then I'm like,

352
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:54.070
this has got to stop.
And I stopped everything for a few months and I thought,

353
00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:55.810
well,
maybe I'll have a cigar.
That would be nice.

354
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.570
And then within weeks I'm smoking two a day,
I can't breathe.

355
00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.360
And then I got to get off the cigars and then we're back on the loss and just,

356
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:05.290
and it all starts again.
Conan could,
God,
it's the joy,

357
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.860
the joy of just all sort of addictive behavior.
Didn't,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

358
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.440
I'm getting now.
It's just time to get off.
Just end it now.

359
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.810
And what the addiction or all of it.
It's the whole thing.

360
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.310
The time to just start off you first time you do it,
I'll do it.

361
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.070
Shuffle off that morning.
All suffered enough.
I,
what was I going to tell you,
man?

362
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:23.170
They gonna tell you some other things that will help you take your life.

363
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.070
That's what I'm going to,
Oh,
I'm on it.
I'm doing it.
I'm actually doing,
dude,

364
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.460
I've been exercising a lot and went to the doctor.
Everything's pretty good.
Wait,

365
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.560
so,
uh,
you went to the doctor.

366
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.680
I know that you were very phobic about easier your health.
Not Bad,
not bad,

367
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:38.140
not as bad as it used to be.
Well,
wait a minute.
You,

368
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.210
you had a big prostate scare.
You told me that.
Yeah.

369
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.960
You told me once that you had a prostate.
I thought I had it.
It's always,

370
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.630
that's the,
that's the,
they've was,
it made you feel that you had a prostate skip?

371
00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.540
Just too much time on my hands.
But what was there any symptom?
It may be like,

372
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.820
what have I got to think about?
Pride,
Diana?
Something.
I'm at that age.

373
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.680
Maybe we should go to the doctor and get one of those exams.
That'll wake me up.

374
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.640
You voluntarily went and had a guy put his hand on your ass?
Not the whole hand.

375
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:10.970
Where do you go?
Oh,
I got a guy that does two hands if you tip them.
Yeah.
That's,

376
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.450
that's a hell of a show of hands and a heel.
Yeah.

377
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.120
He gets all kinds of stuff in there.
Uh,
I'd pay him top quality.
Sure.
Shirts.

378
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.880
A doctor.
Do you know what?
It's funny he doesn't,
he's not dressed like a doctor.

379
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.330
You might want to check out.
Really Weird and it's not at diploma.

380
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.800
There's no diploma.
Yeah.
It got me thinking that,
you know,
we have to do what?

381
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.780
We have to take an ad break.
Is that how you're going to do it?

382
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.033
We're going to take an outbreak.

383
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.980
You can do your own reeds or you're going to drop ads and I do my own ads.

384
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.070
But you don't do them later or you can do it now.
I'm not gonna do it now.
Oh,

385
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:39.880
I don't want you,

386
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.210
I don't want you looking at me while I do an outbreak because the only way I can

387
00:22:43.211 --> 00:22:46.900
do it and really feel good is her naked.
And so I get it.

388
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:51.010
But the naked between radio and podcasting,
it's like when you do a radio show,

389
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.770
you gotta sit there and watch them do the thing.
Hey,
how's everybody?
Yeah.

390
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.380
One of Vermont.
Teddy bear.
You like Teddy bears?
Vermont.

391
00:22:56.381 --> 00:22:59.690
Teddy bear is a big advertiser.
Back in the day that was that true?
Yeah.

392
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:01.323
On Teddy bears.

393
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.810
I said the Alex Bennett used to do it when I was doing that show in San

394
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.940
Francisco.
I did radio for awhile.
You know,

395
00:23:06.941 --> 00:23:10.250
I tried to take an ad break and it's impossible if you take an app or a no,
no,

396
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.760
no.
I didn't take an ad break.
But you've had 45.

397
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.110
What's throat lozenges wrote to the ad break?
Uh,
throw it to the bank to do it.

398
00:23:17.111 --> 00:23:20.290
You think you can stop for a second?
Hey,
what is,
what is,
uh,

399
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.710
what would you like your audience to bike on it?
Oh my God.

400
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.850
I can't wait to tell you,

401
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.650
but it seems like you've got more to say about something.
Oh,

402
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.470
I have a lot more to say.
Boom.
Add break right there.
I've got it.
You know what?

403
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.870
I did it and I screwed it up.
Yeah,
I was trying to help out.
Let's get to that.

404
00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:40.870
I break that.
See,
he can't be the last,

405
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.880
he can't let me be the last one to talk.
You can just cut it.
There's guys,
oh no,

406
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.010
nope.
He's going to go

407
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.490
<v 1>away.
No,
no,
no.
Well,
I'm keeping all of this,
but just give us the ad copy.</v>

408
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:52.180
Let's read it now.
They don't have it.
What?
Yeah,

409
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.300
it's an advertiser that's on the fence until we got Marin.
It's true.

410
00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:01.400
You know what it is?
It's a,
it's a company that sells nicotine lozenges.
Good.

411
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.450
Good.
I wanted you lag.
Yeah,
they did.
Hold on.
We'll take a break

412
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.880
and now it's time for a segment called Conan.

413
00:24:12.881 --> 00:24:16.690
O'Brien pays off the mortgage on his beach house.
Yup.
I'm an adult.

414
00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.950
Took out a big mortgage,
made some sketchy financial choices,

415
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.910
but I'm a big boy and I'm going to pay the pay the Piper and I'm going to pay

416
00:24:24.911 --> 00:24:28.300
them bills down,
paid them bills,
pay them bills.

417
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.890
When you hear crazy fun facts,
Sona,
I'd love to,

418
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.430
there are a lot of hotel rooms out there that just sit empty,

419
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.710
waiting to be booked,
but people don't know about them.

420
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.380
Don't you wish there was a way they could know about them?

421
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.380
There is a way that was probably too aggressive,

422
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:53.150
that was way too strong and not used to this hotel tonight.

423
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.380
I Love Hotel tonight and now you've used hotel tonight.
I've used it before.

424
00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:01.940
I would,
you know we got paid to you.
Uh,
no.
I love this APP.

425
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:06.920
I use this APP in light.
So what is it?
So if you need a hotel on short notice,

426
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:12.070
you pull up hotel tonight and it gives you deals for whatever hotel rooms are

427
00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:16.070
available in whatever area you're looking for.
So if you're like,
hey,
I'm in.

428
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.040
I just happened to be in Santa Barbara and I don't have,
sorry,

429
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:22.620
this sounds like a hookup.
What it does,
it sounds like a hookup.
I mean,

430
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.310
if you meet someone in a bar and you're like,
let's find a hotel.

431
00:25:25.311 --> 00:25:28.910
You pull up hotel tonight and you could,
wow.
Oh my God,

432
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.270
I would not be cool enough to do that.
I would fumble from my phone,

433
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:36.500
accidentally take a Selfie,
which would immediately,

434
00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:39.650
and then the phone would explode.
I just,
it would all go wrong.

435
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.540
I wouldn't know how to do that in that situation.
Oh,
so wait,
so hotel tonight,

436
00:25:44.541 --> 00:25:47.780
this sounds like you're very excited about it.
I saw it as a truthful person.

437
00:25:47.781 --> 00:25:51.110
She nuts.
She always tells the truth to a fault.
I love this.

438
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:56.170
I love this app a lot at shows you cool hotels in your area and they give you

439
00:25:56.331 --> 00:26:00.200
profiles of each hotel.
This one's short,
this one's tall.

440
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:04.070
This hotel has Benny windows.
This hotel has none.

441
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.450
It tells you stuff like that.

442
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.450
I'm going to point this out because I think they want me to point this out.

443
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.950
Hotel tonight's not just for last minute bookings.
Oh,
book way in advance.

444
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.280
I didn't know that.
Yeah,
they've only booking,

445
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.480
but you just,
I mean,
now you're married so there's no hookups,

446
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.700
but I could still go on trips and stuff.
I was like,

447
00:26:23.701 --> 00:26:27.020
you're about to say could still have hookups.
I need to say,
Sonya,
you can't.

448
00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:30.080
You took a vow.
I was at your wedding.
I could go on trips.

449
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:34.800
Spontaneous weekend getaways.
Three Day weekend.
You're reading the paper,

450
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.870
read trips,
business trips,
booking a place with a pool and more.

451
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.740
I could still do all that stuff.
Oh my God,
they got to you.
I've never seen it.

452
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.650
Well,
anyway,
a hotel tonight sounds like you know what?

453
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.710
This is the most enthusiastic I've heard you about anything that we've talked

454
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:53.020
about.

455
00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:57.550
<v 3>I think that this is the most enthusiastic I've been of any of the stuff that we</v>

456
00:26:57.551 --> 00:27:00.460
advertise.
Am I allowed to say that?
Probably not,
but you just did.

457
00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:04.870
I mean cause I used it before we got paid for me to use it and stop saying we

458
00:27:04.871 --> 00:27:06.570
got paid.
I'm sorry.
I mean but

459
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.220
<v 1>point.
We're doing this because we love these products.
We believe in them.</v>

460
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:12.170
I really do love this one.

461
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.050
So to start scoring amazing deals at incredible hotels.

462
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.250
Go to hotel tonight.com or download the APP now.
You already have the,

463
00:27:19.251 --> 00:27:24.200
I already have it.
That's so amazing.
Yeah.
I might get this APP hotel tonight.

464
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.630
Get that APP,
get it.
Yeah.
Okay.

465
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.470
<v 3>Bang.
We're back.
Wow,
that was quick.
Yeah.
Great job on that Ad.</v>

466
00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.340
Then I do a good job.
Excellent.
I put my own personality into it.
It was great.

467
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:44.490
I wish I could remember what I wanted to bring up earlier.
It doesn't matter.
No,

468
00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.000
it does.
As I get older you,
I forget a lot of things.

469
00:27:47.001 --> 00:27:50.390
I walk into rooms a lot now and I don't know why I came into the room.

470
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.950
Then my wife comes in the room and I'm like,
who are you?
It's just,
it's scary.

471
00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.060
It's frightening.
Might want to go back to that doctor.
I'm like,
God,

472
00:27:59.061 --> 00:27:59.894
I lived that done.

473
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:05.150
He put an alarm clock up there once walked.
Yeah.

474
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.810
I walked around with it for four weeks.
It was a fantastic experience.

475
00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.480
Um,
I uh,

476
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:15.080
I wonder why maybe you can answer this because this is part of the point of my

477
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.960
podcast.
We'd known each other 25 years.
I like you.

478
00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.710
I have a lot of respect for you.
You always make me laugh,
but we're not friends.

479
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:26.990
We're not friends.
No,
I tell I've talked about that in particular with you.
Yeah.

480
00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.830
Well there was that.
We don't hang,
we don't have,
do you hang with anybody?
I mean,

481
00:28:30.831 --> 00:28:33.140
where you get to a certain age,
you've got kids,
you've got a wife,

482
00:28:33.141 --> 00:28:34.750
you've got a house,
you've got other things to worry about.

483
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.550
You probably need time just to kind of freak out about shit.
Yeah.

484
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.650
But like how you got to really make time for people.
But I remember when you did,

485
00:28:42.651 --> 00:28:44.900
my show is near the beginning and I appreciate you doing it.

486
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:48.920
And I had done your show many times.
You've always been good to me.
I,

487
00:28:48.921 --> 00:28:53.120
you know I've always been loyal to the show and we had that dynamic and then you

488
00:28:53.121 --> 00:28:56.450
come over and you'd do the podcast and afterwards,
because I wrote about this,

489
00:28:56.451 --> 00:28:57.950
I think I already talked about on the show,

490
00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.100
you kind of hung out for a little while and after a certain point I'm like,

491
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.450
oh he's got to get out of the house.
Yes.
Okay.
Like I don't,
we don't do this.

492
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.320
Picked up on that.
I checked up on that because I did your podcast.

493
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.260
I enjoy your company.
I'm in your home.

494
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:17.450
I am in your home and you started getting anxious and then you started trying to

495
00:29:17.931 --> 00:29:21.770
get me to the door and I was offended.
I was offended.
Yes.

496
00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:25.370
Cause I thought why not sit down?
Did you fail it and,
and,

497
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.480
and offer me a piece of Pumpkin pie would have if I had pie.

498
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.300
You're not a guy that has pumpkin pie around ice cream.

499
00:29:32.301 --> 00:29:34.490
I used to have ice cream back then.
I might've had pie.

500
00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.300
I've had to feed people before so I had to feed people and it's supposed to be

501
00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:41.560
something that you do with love and generosity,
not a chore.

502
00:29:41.561 --> 00:29:43.450
When people come over,
they don't eat properly.

503
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.930
Jon Glaser came over once and he was starving.
I made him a sandwich,

504
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.380
gotten Roseanne came over once and she needed something.
I gave her cantaloupe.

505
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:53.560
People hated it because she was eating cantaloupe on the,
on the mic.

506
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.670
That's a disgusting sound.
When someone needs cantaloupe,

507
00:29:55.730 --> 00:30:00.130
Rosanna talking or you know what I,
that was very good.
That was very good.

508
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:01.060
I'll get any points for that,

509
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.000
but I want to tell you why did you want me out of the house?
I'm a good guy.

510
00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:05.200
I clean up nice.
Oh No,
no.

511
00:30:05.201 --> 00:30:07.940
It was nothing like I didn't want you to have the house.
I just didn't know know.

512
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.050
I'd never been in that situation with you like every time,

513
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.260
like here's what my experience with you.
I come,
I go to the dressing room.

514
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.710
Jimmy gives me a guitar,
I play it.
You come in and say hi,
what's going on?

515
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.540
I see out there,
I go out there,

516
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.890
we say thanks and and yet over the years it's gotten warmer and and then then I

517
00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:24.610
go away.

518
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.580
So there we just talked for an hour by your life and your childhood and then

519
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:28.960
you're in my house and I'm like,

520
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:34.170
I've never had it leave much taller here than he is on the set and we were just

521
00:30:34.721 --> 00:30:37.540
talking and it was awkward and I thought like,
you're lectured me out.

522
00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:39.730
You ushered me out.
Nobody.
Then we actually acknowledge it.

523
00:30:39.731 --> 00:30:41.380
It's like it's weird that we don't hang out.

524
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:43.450
I don't know why we went and hung up,
hang out.
You want to hang out.

525
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.270
I got a lot of people in my phone that I've done on the show that had been on

526
00:30:46.271 --> 00:30:48.160
his show,
but do I call them?
No,
the only guy,

527
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.680
this is why I want to talk to you is that for 25 years I've been talking to

528
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:52.543
three guests tonight.

529
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.790
They're there to promote whatever they're promoting and we look friendly on the

530
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:00.280
air.
But then I don't hang out with them afterwards.

531
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:05.400
Plus probably better than I had a party not long ago and I looked around and

532
00:31:05.711 --> 00:31:08.470
everyone at the party is someone on my payroll.

533
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.280
The only people that came to my party,
our people I pay.

534
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.430
Did you invite other people?
I didn't get an invitation to see,

535
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.380
maybe this is the problem.
No,
I didn't invite you.
You didn't.
Well,

536
00:31:17.381 --> 00:31:18.970
because here's my theory.

537
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.570
My theory is that we aren't peanut butter and jelly or peanut butter.

538
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:25.720
And then on the more acidic peanut butter were like,

539
00:31:25.721 --> 00:31:29.030
like skippy with sugar and then just a chunky rock kind.
Yes.

540
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.320
And you put both of those together and there isn't even,
there wasn't even bread.

541
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.070
You're just eating it with your hands and it's a freak show in your mouth is

542
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:39.880
clicking.
Yeah.
I have no water.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's true.

543
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:44.770
I think we have a certain similar energy.
Yeah.
Uh,
I think,
uh,

544
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.410
you have a lot more in your head than me I think.
Do you think so?

545
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.480
I think naturally your brain,

546
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:54.160
like mine is completely everything that's going on in my head.
You know,

547
00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.180
I'm the center of,

548
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:59.500
I think that you sometimes can kind of look at other things and improvise on

549
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:02.920
that with me.
I have to be like,
what?
How does that affect me?

550
00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:04.270
And then I have to go through that way.

551
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.750
So I think you have a more active imagination that's probably a little more

552
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:12.010
palatable.
I just looked that up online.
That's called narcissism.
Yeah.

553
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:16.210
Why fight that you,
you're losing.
No,
I'm not.
You're losing it.
I'm not,

554
00:32:16.211 --> 00:32:18.820
I'm not a narcissist.
My father was,
you know,
you wait.

555
00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.710
So you think you are not a narcissist.

556
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:24.040
You just said anytime you want to talk about anything you have to relate it to

557
00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:27.190
yourself and how you're the center of the universe yet.
But I'm aware of that.

558
00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:28.740
So that makes me not a Marxist.

559
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.590
So what serial killer can narcissist a narcissist?
Yeah,

560
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.800
you can know a serial killer can know he's a serial killer,

561
00:32:35.801 --> 00:32:39.800
but if he continues to kill in the Pacific northwest,
he's still a serial.
Yeah.

562
00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:44.550
Yeah.
But like he likes that.
I don't particularly like this part of myself.
Okay.

563
00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.150
You don't know because like I,
you know,

564
00:32:47.151 --> 00:32:50.270
my dad I think is really actually a pathological narcissist.

565
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:52.610
I think everyone's a little self centered and a little narcissistic.

566
00:32:52.611 --> 00:32:57.230
So I have shrapnel from that upbringing and behaviors from it.
But it's not,

567
00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:02.150
I don't have a blind spot,
you know,
I'm not,
you know,
I have shame,
I have guilt,

568
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.000
I have a conscience full of empathy.

569
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:09.710
So all that stuff that the self centerdness element is that I tend to think

570
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:12.530
about myself a lot because I'm neurotic,
right?

571
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:17.030
So when I think about things outside of me,
it's,
it has to do with my life,

572
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.540
with its effect on me.
I,
and I think it's helped my comedy to be honest with you,

573
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:23.150
because there was a point,
and you know this to be true.

574
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.750
When you're doing jokes and they're written and they're topical you,

575
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:32.590
you know that the other talk shows are going to do similar theme jokes.
Yup.

576
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:34.310
So that's the same with up.

577
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.050
So once I was able to untether myself from observational or political comedy and

578
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:41.260
just focused on me,
no one's going to steal.

579
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.570
I defy someone to do my material because it's all about me.

580
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:47.720
And if you're that much like me,
then I'll talk to you after the show.

581
00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:52.580
I have to say a your,
this is totally making sense to me because it's,

582
00:33:52.581 --> 00:33:56.660
the thing I liked the least about doing a show right now is when there's this

583
00:33:56.661 --> 00:34:01.490
pressure to be topical.
You talk about Trump because everybody's doing it.

584
00:34:01.491 --> 00:34:05.800
So I find much more joy in comedy that has nothing to do with what's talk about

585
00:34:05.801 --> 00:34:06.820
your own experience.
Right.

586
00:34:06.821 --> 00:34:11.190
So that's what I started to do on a very conscious way of level.
And maybe I,
it,

587
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:11.471
you know,

588
00:34:11.471 --> 00:34:15.160
I took to it pretty well and I can integrate a lot of cultural criticism or

589
00:34:15.161 --> 00:34:18.520
whatever and talk about current events,
but I have to do it,
you know,

590
00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.630
from my point of view and not from jokes.
Yeah.
So it was a,
it was a great,

591
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.850
um,
it was,
it was good for me to,
to realize that yes.

592
00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:28.410
Can I be really honest with you?

593
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.880
The other reason I don't think we hang out is that over the years you introduced

594
00:34:32.881 --> 00:34:35.520
me,
Oh,
this is the woman I'm with,
you know,

595
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.670
and I sort of start to try and form a bond with her and then she's gone.

596
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.820
Cause that happened over the years.
Pretty clever transition.

597
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.180
Well I saw what he did there,
but hasn't it,

598
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:46.620
it was a period of time where you were like,

599
00:34:46.621 --> 00:34:51.210
you had a few of my made two of the wives and most of the girlfriends that have

600
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.390
come,
I'd met them all.
I got them all.
And you know what,

601
00:34:54.391 --> 00:34:57.780
I'm afraid to form a bond with them because I don't know what's going to happen.

602
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.840
Yeah.
But you know what about me?
What about the bomb with me that see,

603
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.730
we still got it.
You know,
I think you've,

604
00:35:02.731 --> 00:35:06.550
you've dealt with friends who have had women.
I happen to know,
uh,

605
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:11.640
you definitely know people who've had a few women come and go.
Yes,
I have.
But uh,

606
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.690
but yet,
believe me,

607
00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:18.210
I had a harder time maintaining the bond with those women that,
that you did,

608
00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.500
but you were,
you're much quicker.
And making me think.

609
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.750
I think I formed a deeper bond with those women.
Probably 20 seconds we talked.

610
00:35:24.751 --> 00:35:29.310
And a you manage whenever you found out in 40 seconds sometimes took me years

611
00:35:29.311 --> 00:35:33.180
and a lot of money to figure out.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's a,
it's a,
it's a liability.

612
00:35:33.181 --> 00:35:35.160
You know,
the,
the relationship thing.

613
00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.670
Anytime you're with someone and is maybe could be the foundation of a new

614
00:35:38.671 --> 00:35:43.350
friendship.
Anytime you start to date someone,
have me meet them,
happy,

615
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.120
meet them alone,
like the third date.
Look,

616
00:35:45.121 --> 00:35:48.420
I just have Conan's going to meet us at the restaurant first date,
first date.

617
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:53.520
First date.
You say before I can see you,
you have to meet Conan O'brien.
Man.

618
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:57.180
If I was single,
this could be a segment dude.
Uh,
it could have been a segment.

619
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.920
It could be.
Again,
you never know.
Um,
oh,
thank you for the vote of confidence.

620
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:06.050
Sorry,
I've just been through this too many times,
you know,
but no,
I'm,

621
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.260
I've been with the one now for like four years.
It's been going pretty good.

622
00:36:10.261 --> 00:36:13.500
I'm very happy for you.
But that,
but that's not like it's a good sign.

623
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:16.950
But the two wives,
the,
those were about eight,
eight and a half years.

624
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:20.590
And then there was that.
As long as the marriage should last I,

625
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.130
but then there was the one that before this one,
the three year one,

626
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.290
that was probably what that would,

627
00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.500
if she would have made me not want to be someone's friend.
Really.

628
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.560
I don't know what happened to her,
but you know,
wait,
we're both wives.

629
00:36:31.561 --> 00:36:33.270
Eight years.
Did you say about,
yeah,

630
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.090
three and a half married and then I was with them for a few years before.
Yeah.

631
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:37.320
Yeah.

632
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.400
That is so interesting because I'm married and eight years into my marriage,

633
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.260
my wife looked at me and said,
I think I'm good.
Yeah,
I'm out.
I think I'm good.

634
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.750
But we still,
we were still together.
You know,
it's still together now.
Yeah.

635
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.860
So how do you get past that hump?
Well,
she just realized I'm a good earner.

636
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.510
She get to everything you wanted to on your notes.
I,
you know,
you keep saying,

637
00:36:57.511 --> 00:37:02.050
I have notes and I really don't.
These are recipes.
Oh,
can I have one?
Says,

638
00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:06.870
I'm looking for some new recipes for thanksgiving.
Um,
but you know what?

639
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:09.840
You would be awful on thanksgiving.
I'm great at I,
I couldn't be terrible.

640
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:13.530
I cooked for 22 people.
Do you even know them?
Do you have their family?

641
00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:16.800
And I didn't do it for a couple of years because I was shooting quo and also I

642
00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:19.410
didn't want to deal with the a Republican contingent,

643
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.400
but I'm going back for the first time in like three years this year and we've,

644
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.690
we've brought the number down.
But I,
I'm the guy who cooks the entire thing.

645
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.610
That's so crazy because you don't have,

646
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.670
you have the opposite of a holiday energy.

647
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.810
Here's how I get into the holiday spirit.
I make this amazing spread and,

648
00:37:35.811 --> 00:37:39.450
and then,
then I walk around and this will,
this will ring true with you.

649
00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.450
I walk around because you know me this way.
I walk around and go like,

650
00:37:42.451 --> 00:37:45.390
how was it this year?
Pretty good.
How's it stuffing?
Right.
The best.
Yeah.

651
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.820
How did I do?
Did I do okay?
Thanks.
Giving dot died.

652
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.220
What did you think of me doing my thanksgiving?
Right?

653
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.460
How did it get over it anymore though?
Cause I've gotten some confidence.

654
00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:00.390
I'm not as insecure as I used to.
You used to be so I don't,
I don't fish for it.

655
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.800
I wait for it.
What if you don't get it?
And I know when you're waiting for it,

656
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:07.410
your legs jiggling,
you're popping,
uh,

657
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:11.070
you know you're popping mentholated lozenges,
cinnamon ones.

658
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:14.420
There's cinnamon four milligrams.
Did you ever smoke a lozenge?

659
00:38:14.421 --> 00:38:17.680
Just out of desperation?
Oh sure man,
I got,
I got him for that light,
I hope.
Yeah.

660
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.550
Different light up a lozenge and just suck on it.
And I snorted him.

661
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.650
I snorted the loss and she's this,
we should do that sometime in an hour.

662
00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.150
Lawson's I'd do that with the saddest thing.
I remember years ago,

663
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.060
this is the story that I've never told man.
Maybe I've told it once,

664
00:38:30.061 --> 00:38:32.190
I don't remember years ago,
back in the day,

665
00:38:32.191 --> 00:38:35.770
come in and this might not make the cut we have,
we have very low bar.

666
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.500
Well now I was with the,
I was with Matt,

667
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:40.540
it was back when I was still using drugs and,
and we had been drinking all night.

668
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:41.410
Me and this guy,
Matt,

669
00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:44.680
and we're back at the house where I lived with a bunch of other dudes and we'd

670
00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:48.610
run out of drugs and we had run out of wicker and we were chopping up,

671
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:51.480
we were grinding up,
you remember vibrant wasn't called by front,

672
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.450
the yellow pills,
which at best is equal to two cups of coffee.

673
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.250
And we were snorting vibrant.

674
00:38:57.251 --> 00:39:01.030
So there was like are the guide yellowness caked in our nostrils and it's like

675
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:05.170
two in the morning and Bob comes home from work after being a waiter and he

676
00:39:05.171 --> 00:39:08.560
looks at us,
he walks into the kitchen,
he's like,
are you snorting vibrant?

677
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:14.350
What you're snorting [inaudible] and he just shakes his head and goes to bed.

678
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.460
It was a,
it was one of those moments where it was like,
I,
this is stupid.

679
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.250
This is a new,
this is a new low.

680
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:25.210
We just apparently wanting to snort something didn't matter when.

681
00:39:25.211 --> 00:39:29.160
I'm glad you mentioned vibrant because the good folks at vibrant,
great,

682
00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.020
amazing product,

683
00:39:31.021 --> 00:39:35.430
great and vibrant Lawson they bought into Brian needs a friend.
Yeah.

684
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.640
And uh,
that was perfect the way you segwayed into it.

685
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.900
I love talking to you.
I really do.
And,
and uh,

686
00:39:42.901 --> 00:39:46.260
I'm very honored that you would stop by my podcast.
As I said,

687
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.550
you are the master of this form and I basically got you here to ask you one

688
00:39:50.551 --> 00:39:53.650
simple question,
which is,
well I make money.
I think he will.

689
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.440
I think you'll start out with a pretty good crowd and like,
you know,

690
00:39:56.441 --> 00:40:00.610
it was over there.
You guy that.
Um,
but you think I'm going to make some cash?

691
00:40:00.611 --> 00:40:03.130
Yeah,
I do.
I do.
I don't know if it's cash or you're used to,

692
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.280
but I think that you'll see what the numbers are and then you sell the numbers

693
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:10.780
cause I need,
you can't need money.
I fucked up.
You did.

694
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.360
I fucked some stuff.
You're one of those guys.
He overextended.

695
00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:17.640
Where's the second house?
It was a few problems.
Boat.
You've got a boat.

696
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:22.140
There was a boat.
There was a boat.
It was,
I'll say that.
Well,

697
00:40:22.141 --> 00:40:27.141
so I got excited about two years ago about theme restaurants and I went into,

698
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.820
and I went in,
I went in big on theme restaurants.
I did not consult anybody.

699
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.470
I did not consult my wife.

700
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:39.270
I did not consult my business manager and lost it all.
And I'm sorry,

701
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.970
there was a theme restaurant in the valley,
a whole chain of them.

702
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.860
It was a new idea.
And the whole idea was,
you know,

703
00:40:44.861 --> 00:40:46.860
that some of them are like 1950s themes.

704
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.040
This was a depression era themed restaurant and cause you have to go wearing a

705
00:40:53.341 --> 00:40:56.430
barrel.
Did the wait staff where a barrel,
that was one of the ideas.

706
00:40:56.431 --> 00:40:58.260
We rejected that because we thought it was impractical,

707
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:03.060
but it was a lot of just depression era themed music was playing.
And uh,

708
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:08.070
we mostly just served apples and it tanked.
No good.

709
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.480
And I went in,
I didn't know,

710
00:41:09.481 --> 00:41:13.170
you're not supposed to put your own money and here's what's,
Oh yeah.

711
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.380
So I'm sorry.
No,
I think you'll do okay.
You know what,

712
00:41:16.381 --> 00:41:21.210
what happened if I said to you,
I think you'll do okay.
You'll spiral,

713
00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:26.400
but we would,
you would spiral,
wouldn't you?
If,
hey,
hey,

714
00:41:26.401 --> 00:41:27.480
next time you're on the show,

715
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:31.920
if I went back behind backstage in the green room and you went as a crowd and I

716
00:41:31.921 --> 00:41:36.710
went,
I think you'll do.
Okay.
That's pretty,
you would just turn into a puddle,

717
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:39.680
a Mark Marin puddle.
I think you're going to do great.

718
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.850
I feel like that your account now.
I think it will be okay.

719
00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:54.050
Uh,
honored to have you.
Thank you so much.
Yeah,
thank you.
That was fun.
Fine.

720
00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:57.680
You didn't it everything.
You didn't take a whole no,
I didn't.
I just,
you know as,

721
00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.440
again,
these are just Paula Deen recipes.

722
00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.690
I'm trying to figure out if I ever have any questions for you.

723
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.960
You can ask me a question.
Why don't you ask me a question and you're the podcast

724
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:12.140
that's not necessary.
It's not wow.
What a good work ethic.
Yeah.

725
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.870
I think it was how you approach everything in your life.
Huh?
Well,

726
00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:20.160
I have a question flush that toilet question,

727
00:42:20.161 --> 00:42:22.660
but it's sort of serious and I don't think there's an answer to it.
And,

728
00:42:22.661 --> 00:42:26.550
and I think that,
uh,
you know,
I'd processed it and it's a little heavy.

729
00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.830
There is a god,
there's a heavy,
it's a little heavy.

730
00:42:28.831 --> 00:42:33.510
It's all personal and it's a little heavy.
You want me to ask it?
Yeah.
Okay.

731
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:37.470
So when you hosted the tonight show,
yeah.
Why aren't you have me on?

732
00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.570
Why didn't I have you on the tonight show?
Yeah.

733
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.050
Because it only lasted for 45 minutes.

734
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:46.880
I didn't get to you.
Okay.
I,

735
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:51.890
this is so many people that weren't on that tonight show because I mean it was a

736
00:42:52.291 --> 00:42:53.124
bad time.

737
00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:57.480
They're understanding there are an apple will rot faster.

738
00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.910
Well,
I think what it was like for me at that time,
I,
you know,

739
00:43:02.911 --> 00:43:05.520
it's probably not great.
Do you realize we didn't get,

740
00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:09.600
there was not a lot of time that we were on the air and um,

741
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:11.460
you took,
this is amazing.

742
00:43:11.461 --> 00:43:16.420
You took my losing it tonight shill and made it about you.
Wait,

743
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.860
that's,
that's that.
No,
that is not an interpretation.

744
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.870
That is what you did.
I was excited that you got the show.
I was all,

745
00:43:24.871 --> 00:43:28.590
I was always on the other show.
I was like,
this is going to be great.
I've waited.

746
00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.920
I didn't do the tonight show with anybody else and I'm going to do with my pal

747
00:43:31.921 --> 00:43:36.660
Conan and I should be on in the first week.
The no fee?
No.
Why?

748
00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:40.880
Well because we had pearl jam will Pharrel we,

749
00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.000
I mean I'm sorry.

750
00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:46.110
I'm sorry you weren't on the first week and I think in my head I was thinking,

751
00:43:46.111 --> 00:43:49.770
can't wait to have mark on because you know what they say about tonight?

752
00:43:49.771 --> 00:43:52.230
Show host once you name it tonight,
show host,

753
00:43:52.231 --> 00:43:55.770
he lasts as long as he wants and then you know what happened?

754
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:57.240
That didn't happen.

755
00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:02.930
And so I never got to you because there wasn't enough time and I apologize and I

756
00:44:03.001 --> 00:44:07.320
wish now if I could get in a time machine that you are my first guest on that

757
00:44:07.321 --> 00:44:10.720
tonight show.
Thank you.
I didn't mean it.

758
00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.860
I know you'll do okay here and I feel terrible now.
You feel solid or friends?

759
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:17.250
I didn't want to bring it up,
but I was just,
I just like,
I dunno.

760
00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.370
I wanted some closure or something.

761
00:44:18.371 --> 00:44:20.950
I forgot that I had the resentment until this morning.

762
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:26.740
You resent that I didn't have you on the show.
It's over now.

763
00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:31.520
It was on for,
yeah,
and I'm sorry about that.
Sorry.

764
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:36.360
Can you see me all choked up about it?
No,
no.
This is better.
You know,

765
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:38.580
if I had my choice between the tonight show or a podcast,

766
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:42.570
this is clearly the one I tell you.
This is clearly the way I go.

767
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.950
This is the hardest I've seen you laugh actually in a while.
Well,

768
00:44:46.951 --> 00:44:50.270
I'm honored to be one of the first guests on the podcast.
Well,
if this is,

769
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.940
this is anything like,
hey,
you know,

770
00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:59.970
this may be one of four episodes I got in under the wire.

771
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.010
You know what's going to happen in six weeks?

772
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:06.160
Why Jay Leno is going to get this podcast.
It's going to do a,

773
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:10.320
it's going to do it from a fire engine or a car.
An interesting format.

774
00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.500
How they work.
I just talking to how do they see me

775
00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.610
thing?
I see the car.

776
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:24.950
It had nine felonies.
No one knows mine heaven.
If I'm fine.

777
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:30.400
This is good.
We're sweating it out.
We're sweating out the toxins.
All right.

778
00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.430
I don't say this often,
but I love you.

779
00:45:32.431 --> 00:45:35.690
You're a great man and I thank you so much.
I really am.
Thank you for,

780
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.910
I really am honored.
Thank you so much for me to leave that last part again.

781
00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:50.820
<v 1>Time for another installment of Conan O'brian pays off the mortgage on his beach</v>

782
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:51.654
house.

783
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:01.810
Watch the old show.
Gilligan's island.
I do.
They made everything on a bamboo.

784
00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.960
The professor could make a radio out of bamboo Gilligan,

785
00:46:04.961 --> 00:46:07.960
could make a bicycle out of bamboo.
They lived in bamboo huts.

786
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.100
Everything was bamboo.

787
00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.380
There's one thing they didn't think about it on that island,

788
00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:16.500
making clothing out of bamboo task performance made that dream that they never

789
00:46:16.961 --> 00:46:20.800
had indoor reality.
Wow.
It's a weird sentence.

790
00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:24.490
Task performance was brought to life in 2009 with one goal,

791
00:46:24.491 --> 00:46:27.640
invent revolutionary fabrics to reinvent performance apparel,

792
00:46:27.641 --> 00:46:30.430
and they did it because everything's made from bamboo.

793
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.460
That means it's better for the environment because you can grow.

794
00:46:33.461 --> 00:46:38.350
Bamboo grows quickly.
I don't know how you make clothes out of it.
They do tasks,

795
00:46:38.351 --> 00:46:40.150
knows exactly how to make clothes out of it.

796
00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:42.730
Most of the things that we've done ads for,

797
00:46:42.731 --> 00:46:46.810
you don't know how to do if I say so go out and get that heart surgery right
now.

798
00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:51.010
You never weigh in and go,
I don't know how to deal heart surgery,

799
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.440
who we know.
You don't know how to make clothing out of bamboo,

800
00:46:53.441 --> 00:46:55.540
but task does and they do it brilliantly.

801
00:46:55.541 --> 00:46:58.780
They harness the bamboos natural performance qualities.

802
00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.810
They make this silky smooth,
great fabric.

803
00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:05.210
I was just saying this today to one of my kids.
I was telling them tasks,
Pim,

804
00:47:05.211 --> 00:47:10.211
a lux fabric brings together the luxury of Pima cotton with the versatility of

805
00:47:10.601 --> 00:47:13.540
bamboo performance technology.
My kid was like,
what are you talking about?

806
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:17.530
And I said,
just listen to me.
I'm talking about PMO.
Lux Fabric,
settle down

807
00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:24.270
and you notice got,
that's important for me.
It's got UPF 50 plus protection.
Yeah,

808
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:28.510
with superior breathability because not only do I burn easily,

809
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.580
but I emit many odors,

810
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:36.580
so it's just a great product.
Bamboo.
Who'd a thought,
right?

811
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.760
I wouldn't have you ever look at bamboo and go.

812
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.770
That would make it really great fabric.
Yeah.

813
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:44.760
I don't know how they made radios out of it either.
Oh,
the,

814
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.310
they just nailed them together.
Anyway,
it's exciting.

815
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:53.110
You can probably tell by the way I'm talking to task.
Performance is good stuff.

816
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:57.790
It is.
It's good stuff.
It's good stuff.
It's exciting.

817
00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:58.803
It is.

818
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:03.310
Pima Lux fabric brings together the luxury of Pima cotton with the versatility

819
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:05.530
of bamboo performance technology.
If I've said that once,

820
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:08.950
I've said it a thousand times,
um,
and they sent us some stuff,

821
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:13.300
which is really nice.
I felt it and if it felt silky and it felt breathable,

822
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:17.890
it doesn't feel like a tree.
Oh my God.
You're the worst.

823
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:19.870
You think that should be their slogan.

824
00:48:19.871 --> 00:48:24.610
It doesn't feel so I'm of Sassy and says it doesn't feel like a tree.

825
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:28.930
That's right.
It doesn't feel like a tree.
And Joy.

831
00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:49.731
<v 2>Okay.</v>

832
00:48:49.731 --> 00:48:53.690
It's time for a new segment called ways in which Conan is like Freddie Mercury.

833
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:57.700
Now why I'm bringing this up because Sonia's is absolute hero in show business

834
00:48:57.701 --> 00:49:02.210
businesses,
Freddie Mercury.
And I'm hard and I'm guessing I'm number two.

835
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:05.870
And so one of the ways in which I'm like Freddie Mercury,
not at all,

836
00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.820
not even in little talking about,
I'm a great,
I'm a great showman.
Well,

837
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:14.600
I mean the way you're a great showman in the way Freddie Mercury was a great

838
00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:18.050
showman,
are very different.
What's the difference?
Uh,

839
00:49:18.051 --> 00:49:22.610
he was the best front man of a band ever.
And uh,

840
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.410
you dance like a club.

841
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:33.500
My God,
I'm sorry.

842
00:49:33.501 --> 00:49:36.890
No,
you,
you are great at what you do,

843
00:49:36.891 --> 00:49:39.560
but you can't compare yourself to Freddie Mercury.

844
00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:44.450
I saw the movie about Freddie Mercury,
the bio pic,
Bohemian rhapsody.

845
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.260
Okay.

846
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:50.150
I saw Bohemian rhapsody and I watched it and what I thought when I was watching

847
00:49:50.151 --> 00:49:54.290
it was there telling my story.
Oh boy.
That's what I felt.

848
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:57.410
How do you think you are?
Like Freddie Mercury.

849
00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.770
He was born with extra teeth and that gave him this incredible,

850
00:50:00.771 --> 00:50:04.820
which felt like a disadvantage.
But then it also gave him this incredible,
uh,

851
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.950
multi octave range.
Okay.

852
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:11.080
I was born with a certain body and certain,
uh,

853
00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.270
fidgety mannerisms,
uh,
and,
uh,

854
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:19.300
strange hair that ha and a weird first name that all were disadvantages when I

855
00:50:20.151 --> 00:50:21.050
was a child,

856
00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:25.130
but then made me the greatest front man in the history of rock and roll.
Boy,

857
00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:29.210
you almost had me until the end and I think,
you know what,

858
00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.020
here's what I'm going to say.

859
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:35.020
I think you would be just as funny in a different body because it's your brain

860
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:36.350
that makes you funny.

861
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:40.430
But it's hard to argue that it's not his teeth that gave him the range that he

862
00:50:40.431 --> 00:50:41.060
has.

863
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:46.060
I think that my career has gone through many of the ups and downs that Freddie

864
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:51.710
Mercury's did.
And I think that,
uh,
I was the voice of a generation

865
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:57.890
worldwide in the 70s and into the 80s.

866
00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:01.730
You think you are a voice of a generation in the 70s.

867
00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:05.840
You were like in your teens.
Anyone was listening.
Oh,

868
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:09.770
you were just talking to yourself.
I have my version of,

869
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:14.390
I think when I go to comicon and do shows there,
it's like Wembley.

870
00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:19.010
Oh,
okay.
And I think it means as much to a worldwide audience.

871
00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:21.200
Do you think you make comparisons?

872
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:25.640
You compare yourself to people like I dunno,
I mean just going off memory.

873
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:30.470
People like Jesus and William Shakespeare and the bottles.
Oh,
you'd think.
Okay.

874
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:33.860
All right.
Well I feel like I'm a talking.

875
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:38.770
My father could have been a carpenter.
Ah,
I um,

876
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.520
I have apostles,
meaning writers.
You look at your writers,
his apostles.

877
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.680
This podcast is my sermon.
A lot of similarities.

878
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:52.790
Do you think you're a little ill?
Uh,

879
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:57.620
yeah.
All the way Picasso was ill,
ill,

880
00:51:57.621 --> 00:51:59.450
the way Mozart was ill.

881
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.470
So you're saying I'm sort of like Freddie Mercury,

882
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:05.000
just not completely like Freddie Mac?
No.

883
00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:08.420
I said you're nothing like Freddie Mercury.
I can sing like him.

884
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:13.370
Do you have parties that are just full of debauchery or are you like,

885
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:18.020
here's,
here's my wine.
Well,
if it's inappropriate amount of wine,

886
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.100
you don't want to have more than a glass.
Maybe two,

887
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:26.260
two glasses at most because then there's the sugar and uh,

888
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:28.370
also with dehydrates.

889
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.050
So make sure that you drink three glasses of water for every glass of wine.

890
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.570
I'm sure that's something Freddie Mercury did and I'm sure he watched his

891
00:52:35.571 --> 00:52:36.404
cluster all the way.
I do.

892
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.250
And I'm sure he was really good friends with his college roommate and they

893
00:52:43.251 --> 00:52:47.570
talked about Theodore Roosevelt a lot.
These are things,

894
00:52:47.571 --> 00:52:51.980
ways in which Freddie Mercury and I are very similar.
Oh boy.
Anyway,

895
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:56.420
I get it to best showman that you've known in your life.
Freddie Mercury,

896
00:52:56.421 --> 00:53:00.890
Conan O'brien.
Who's to say who was actually the better showmen Freddie Mercury?

897
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.390
Well,
you can think about it more if anymore.
Freddie mercury,

898
00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.510
Freddie Mercury.
So we'll get your final decision.

899
00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.960
Okay.
Freddie mercury,

900
00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:22.370
Freddie Mercury.
No,
she's mulling it over.
Freddie mercury,

901
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.370
Freddie mercury await Freddie mercury,
