Speaker 1:          00:03          Well, you wanted it and it's back. That's right. Palm is back on Verizon. What's Palm you say? I mean, I didn't hear you say that, but I'm guessing you said what's Palm? Well, let me tell you, palms, a small practical companion device that syncs with your existing smartphone. It doesn't replace your smart phone, but it connects to it so you can leave your phone behind and then you can take palm with you. So f you phone. I got palm. I think that's the idea of palm. Go to palm.com to learn more because clearly I'm not helping run to your nearest Verizon store to check out palm for yourself and say to them, Conan explained it, but not very well.

Speaker 2:          00:42          Hello, my name is Wanda Sykes.

Speaker 3:          00:44          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:47          And I feel uh, somewhat trapped about being Conan O'brien's friend because he's right here in front of me.

Speaker 3:          00:58          Back to school.

Speaker 2:          01:17          Hey there, welcome to Conan O'brien needs a friend. This is a show where I Conan O'Brien. I talked to celebrities and interesting personalities, basically people I've had on my show over the years. And I tried to see if we can become real friends, not just on camera friends. Um, aided in my quest by my assistant sona. Hi. Hello. Hey Sona. And now my producer Matt Gorley. Hi. Okay. Today's guest is a comedian who is brilliantly funny. She's been coming on my show for a very long time. I love her Wanda Sykes.

Speaker 2:          01:59          Okay. So it sounds to me like you're not doozy astic about the idea of being my friend. You're not sure how you feel about it. You feel like this is a contrived situation. Yes. Yes. This isn't something that would naturally come about. Were you an IRF Froggert shop and we bumped into each other. Right? Well, you would never find me at a frozen shop. So right there, you know, absolutely nothing about me that's Sydney would have said, oh, you know, walked into this that we were in the same bar or, right. Like Weirdos, dump junk. It's that we have to do, yeah, we have to get junk junk. It's old. And then if, say, you know, we were at the, at the hotel lounge or whatever, and at a bar, that's more of it. That's a situation that you could see unfolding much more than I walk into a frogger shop and you're there having like a triple scoop cone, right.

Speaker 2:          02:48          With organic organic. Know what, maybe if, if, if, if I were with the kids, then you'll, then you would catch me in a shot. Yeah, I do. Maybe I know more about you than you think I do. Maybe. Maybe I knew you have twins, you have twins. That seems overwhelming to me. That just was very, very overwhelming. I mean, the, the first week I really was thinking that, yeah, I might have to take one back. I know. I honestly, I'm serious. I honestly thought that, but I was like, we have a boy and a girl and, and I was just wondering which one would my wife pick right to return. Right. And uh, and then I was like, she's, she's not going to be in on this. I think I'm sold on this idea. I don't think she would have gone away with returning one. Nope. Is the return policy. I don't even know. That sounds crazy. They're gorgeous kids. They're beautiful kids. You know? No one's stones were trained one hair. I could've got a nice penny for one of them. You thought about this, did you, did you scout out what the prices are?

Speaker 2:          03:57          Inquiries. I was pretty sure I can get six figures. You know what? That's a great way to say I love you too. A child. I looked into it and you know, worth six figures and I kept you my mother. I'm Irish Catholic, so big surprise here. I'm one of six kids. Wow. You fall in that line of sick. He, I am in the middle now. A lot of people, math nerds are like, how can you be the middle of six? You don't care. I don't care. But I'm the third from the top and the third from the bottom. So yeah, I think of myself as wait for it from the, but that's not right. Wait, that's wrong. That means there's another kid in here somewhere. The seventh he didn't make it. We left him in the attic too long. Supposed to crack a window anyway. I, I'm forced from the bottom third from the top.

Speaker 2:          04:51          But my mom had a kid like every six months. I don't know. Shit. It's impossible. It's not. If you have the Irish gene, you can have a child. You can have up to two children a year. Wow. Yeah. And so my mom had litters then. It's craziness. Neil was born in 61 [inaudible] 62 Conan 63 Kate 64. Gene 67. What happened there? They waited a few years. Then Justin comes piling along right after that. I, it's insanity and, and uh, it was the wild west in my house. No one was, no one was paying attention to us. Winning around. Your kids are both being doused with love. I bet all the time. They are pretty. That's nice. They get a lot of attention. I need to be reparented. I'd like to come to your house and be reparented by you and your wife if that's possible or reparented. I'd like you to be my painful.

Speaker 2:          05:44          You don't want to deal with me. No one wants full, no one wants to deal with me and you're so tall. That's puts a strain on my neck. Cause now I'm always happy to, you know, also just to be friends, you have to agree to it that we have a lot of conversations and seed it. I, I'm not going to be walking around with your neck a neck. What if I agreed to always be in a wheelchair? Oh, that's even better. One of those little scooter ones. That's even, yeah. You and I are walking down the street eating frogger, a Wanda Sykes, Conan O'brien and I'm in one of those electric scooters and we have adventures together. Yeah. Because what I've noticed is that I've known you for years. You came on my show very early on, man. Yeah. You were one of the people that came on very early on in the show and uh, we've known each other a long time and I've always loved your comedy and I love you as a person.

Speaker 2:          06:36          I really do think you're terrific and yet we're not friends. Real friends. Yeah. And I'm thinking, and that happens a lot on my show where I can really connect with people on the TV show and then, uh, TV shows over and buy and we hug. Right. And then you get in a big black SUV and you're dripping away and that's it. And I don't see you again unless this sun, another work thing. G or so you only come on my show to promote something? Um, no, I've been on your show just to like hang out again. Have to ask some funny stuff to say. Yeah, I'll go, I'll go. But what I'm getting from this does, you've never called the show and said, um, you haven't called me and I have nothing to promote, but I just like to see Conan. You've never done that? Nope.

Speaker 2:          07:23          Oh yes. It hotter in here. Good Lord. What is going on? This is, we're going to switch rooms and this is, um, all right, this is a former Brandon here. Sweet Jesus. We're making a Samurai Samurai Brad in the back. It is warm in here. Yeah, this isn't the best. Um, but we're going to get a better place. Okay. And so just chill and then you're going to come back to the nicer place. But when I come back, hopefully between that time we would have, you know, developed some type of a friendship. I hope so. It would maybe start with you inviting me to your house. Yes. That's a stretch, right? What do you, what do you mean that's a stretch. Wow. That is the really busy in the most basic way. It takes a while to get into the house. Since the dawn of time, people have said, come to my home.

Speaker 2:          08:17          That is how ancient people showed friendship and cordiality and I just suggest it and you shut me down so fast, but when you make it to my house and I'm like, Hey, come over, you know, hang out at my house. That, that, that's like, I'll help you had a body friendship. Wow. Yeah. Okay. That's a stretch for me right now. Yeah. Right now we're still at the, maybe just somewhere you'll meet me in a neutral. Yeah. Yeah. That's like your, that goes well then it's like, yeah, come on over man. Okay. You just did. Basically, they always tell someone who's meeting, uh, you know, a drug king pin meet in a public place. So he can't tell you that's how you're treating me. You're treating me like I'm a potential murderer. Murderer. No, that's a stretch. You know, we'll say, well I'm just like, just getting to know so one. Okay. Right. Just make sure it's a public place where there's a lot of people there do a lot of people, but you want some people there in case I, I start to flip out. Other people were there to restrain me physically. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:31          Yeah. We're going to be really good friends. You know, it's funny cause we just mentioned, I just mentioned murderers. You and I, and I've talked with you about this before, but we do share something in common that we can talk about when we become real friends. We both love murder, love, murder shows you love them. I love them. I love them. To the point where I had to like take a break from them because I was just, you know, looking at people as like, yeah bitch, you probably got an body in this trunk or really just poured. Yeah. Or I'll look at couples and I'll think like who's going to do it? Who's going to kill those until yeah. There and then, and then cry on the local news and say, I can't believe you can't. You can't, you call it out. Now if someone goes missing and if the spouse is on, on the news, don't you know? Yes. You can tell automatically right away. Yeah. Right away. I know from nine one one calls, you can tell from a nine one one call. Yup. You can just listen to the timber of their voice. And I go, oh man. Yeah he did that. He said, what is he talking about? Cause he's usually forcing it a little bit. Yeah. Or given too much information. Yes. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          10:42          Oh cause I was at Mcdonald's and I had, and I have the receipt.

Speaker 2:          11:11          Did it, did it. That's so true. Yeah. I watch every single murder show and there's that show. Um, is it investigative files? Uh, what does that forensic files, forensic files. Oh yeah. They take over a headline news after a certain time. This is, so what happens is I've stumbled upon forensic files and I've watched maybe 18 in a row and I was upset and I was supposed to like pick up my son and I didn't. And he's wandering in the woods alone and I'm watching a show and I'm, and I can't, I can't stop. I can't stop it. And I'm just, I'm fascinated by those shows. And I'm always fascinated by how many people murder for the smallest thing. Like he had some butterscotch candies and, and his friend wanted three of them, you know, so he went in there and just blood and hair on the walls and mean just to cry, you know, and he leaves with two butterscotch candies.

Speaker 2:          12:18          I don't know. I would, I love murder so much that I have said many times I would love to murder or even be murdered if I was murdered. I'd be honored. Isn't that weird? Because I'd be like, I made it into the club. I'm such a fan of murder that someone murdered me. Yay. I made it out to murder. Someone took the time to murder me and now I get to be in the, and now everyone gets to talk about who did it. And uh, it's probably a weird message to put out there. It is. It is. Um, we've talked about this a lot, but I do think that you were in the best named movie of all time and you know what I'm talking about. You can't get enough of it. I can't, I can't get enough of it. Pootie Tang. Yeah. Every time I'm on the show you, the thing is, it's been Pootie Tang and the thing is, I don't know how long ago that was now, Lord, that was probably 18 years ago.

Speaker 2:          13:16          Yeah. 2016 years ago. Who knows? Someone out there knows exactly when it was. Yeah. If I was interviewing you when you are 110 I would ask you about Pootie Tang and it regardless of what else you would done in your life. You know what I mean? Yeah. You could have just become the first African American woman to be elected president at the age of 110 years old. And my first question to you would be, let's talk about Pootie Tang and then I'd be fired as an investigative journalist. Yes. Yes. Such a incredibly, yeah, and it made me laugh though. You'd lie. I would enjoy it if I can make them laugh. That's all I want to do. That's all I want to do. Do you have a podcast? Cause if you don't, you're the only person who does. I don't have a podcast. Would you like to have this one?

Speaker 2:          14:10          I'll give it to you. It's so generous. Yeah, they're not. It's really, it's just a couple of microphones and some guys I've ever met. I don't have them. I'm happily going to give them to you. They all come in one van with all the equipment. It really is like a dominoes acme, like you can have, you know, that's actually a good deal. A good idea would be a company that you call him up and within 30 minutes or less they come up and they set up a podcast and your house and then you do a podcast and it is available to automatically download for all of your friends. That's an idea. You could make some money off of it and Matt would that work? That's basically what you got here, that that's already happened. That's why it's so hot in here is that we're in the back of a van.

Speaker 2:          14:52          Right back of a van. Yeah. But he's a nice man. It's really not. It's really not. It's mine. It's home. Yeah. It's a nice fan. I haven't seen shag carpet like this when I got to sleep in it in quite awhile. Carpet. Oh my God. But you know what it is. Uh, you probably get asked all the time like people, cause you're funny, you're great cats do podcasts, do podcasts. And I was getting asked all the time to do podcasts. Then I thought, I'm going to have a podcast just so I can, that's my excuse to not do other podcasts. Oh, I didn't think about that. If you didn't want to come here today, I could have just told you. Coulda just said one of them. I'm going to, no, you don't have one. No, everybody's got one. Maybe that'll be my podcast and basically all it is is it's your day. You live in your life. You put no effort into it. You were just might for the day. Someone like this producer, Matt chops it up into a podcast and people listen to it. They would, people like you, they would listen to it and then that's your excuse for not doing a podcast. It's your get out of jail free card. All the podcasts that I got out of doing because I'm doing this podcast. Yeah. There's no awkward conversation with Mark Marin, dax shepard or Chazz Palminteri. I mean literally everybody's got one

Speaker 1:          16:20          and now it's time for a segment called Conan O'Brien pays off the mortgage on his beach house. Yup. No reason to get into this at length. I have a mortgage on my beach house. Got To pay it down.

Speaker 1:          16:37          So let's talk about erectile dysfunction. It's a problem for a lot of guys. Fortunately not me. I almost, I think I have the opposite problem. What I uh, don't mean this to sound creepy in any way, but I am at attention 24 hours a day. If it needs to stop right now, please 24, seven, it's the worst. It's a problem. I've had to have most of my jeans altered. Scientists are studying me to find out how I'm able to do this. A constant source of pain. But anyway, for some men, they have the opposite problem, which is erectile dysfunction and they don't want to talk about it and they think, oh, I can fix this on my own. I can buy some popsicle sticks or whatever. You can't. Popsicle sticks and glue do not work.

Speaker 1:          17:27          Oh, you're laughing a little too hard there. SONA. I don't know what you've experienced in your life, but why me tell you something. You need Roman in your life. Romans a one stop shop where licensed us physicians can diagnose erectile dysfunction. And then he shipped the medication right to your door. If you don't have that embarrassing thing. I've had to buy Sabz and ointments at the drug store and it's tough because they recognize me. I'm quite famous and I'm asking for something that I wish I didn't have to ask for. I'm purchasing a, an adult diaper or something and I don't wear them, not because I need them, but for the comfort. And also they look great. My wife thinks they're sexy, but the point is, there's no waiting rooms. There's no weird conversations. You can handle everything online. All you have to do is visit.

Speaker 1:          18:14          Get roman.com/conan. Get roman.com/conan. Fill out a brief brief medical onboarding. Uh, you have a little chat with a doctor and then you get FDA approved Ed meds and they're delivered right to your door. And you know, it's nice. The package says, not erectile dysfunction meds on it. That subtle. I made that up, that dust. That's not true. I really need this ad to end. Okay. For free online visit, go to get roman.com/conan that's get Roman dotcom slash Conan for a free online visit. If I didn't believe in this, what I let them use my name and the Promo Code.

Speaker 1:          18:57          You know why I like me undies? No, it sounds like underwear that was named by a pirate. That's why I love them. I ain't got to me undies. I'm wearing me undies. I am and then the parents like with micro modal fabric, how the parent knows that the parent knows all about cause they have micro modal fabric. That's what me undies has. Plus as you know I'm always wanting underwear that's got different cuts for men and women because we're built differently. I'm actually, I've been told I'm built a lot like a woman but there are differences and they just got a lot of cool stuff. Me undies, they sent us a package. They did. They came to the office to the day and I tried on the me undies. Unfortunately, I tried them on over my jeans and that was a lawsuit, but so they have a great offer for my listeners.

Speaker 1:          19:46          First Time purchasers get 15% off and free shipping when you purchase any me undies you ordered by 1216 wait a minute. I think it's past 1216 wow. Okay. Get yourself a time machine, an order by 1216 to receive your order before Christmas. If you're listening to this now, it's too late. God knows when they even run this. All this Christmas stuff is bullshit at this point. If you're trying to get this for Christmas, you fucked up big time. That's right. And if you've got a time machine, you wouldn't go back and stop Lincoln from getting shot at Ford's theater. You'd go back in, order me undies to make the Christmas deadline, God. But anyway, it's a great underwear. Get 15% off a pair of the most comfortable undies you will ever put on free shipping and 100% satisfaction guaranteed when you go to [inaudible] dot com slash Conan did it take you a long time to get here today? Do you live close by? Please tell me it was, this was this close by. My biggest fear in show is putting people

Speaker 2:          20:48          out. I hate when I feel like I've taken someone out of their day if I'm imposing on them. That makes me nuts. It makes me crazy. I hope you at least got to run some errands on the way here or on the way back. I said did would you do? Um, I stopped and picked up my kids from the bowling alley. Your kids, they're old enough to go to a bowling alley alone. They were with the AU pair. Okay, Annie, for a second. I thought you just left them at the bowling alley. No, you like don't just leave you like duct tape his colon and come on money around like that. That's 12 figures.

Speaker 2:          21:26          I think that's how it works. Again, that getting, I'm not good at the math. When they do boulder, they put the guards up on either side. You have those little guard rails come up. They do. I worry about those, but when they bolt with me, I make them put them down good. Because my son, my first son, I took him bullying those rails, came up and he took the ball and he whipped it and it caremed off each 15 times way down and then accidentally knocked over a couple of pins and he looked at, he turned and looked at me like I did it, I did it daddy. And I thought this generation is done. They're done. Before the [inaudible] started, this kid, a Turkey could have, could have nudged a ball and it would have knocked down as many pins as my sons did cause it just bounced off.

Speaker 2:          22:15          And he goes, look, if elation and then what is this? This no put, put the rail in his day and if you're going to throw, you know, 20 gutter balls in a row. So bid, learn now, learn now. Yeah. That's the generation was a generation that understood that and they fought world war two. Yup. Well they actually started World War II. They told him the greatest generation. I think it's bullshit. He started as much as they, when they made a mess and they cleaned it up. Anyway, that's going to get me in trouble. Two broke out here. Is that like Bro, cause listen, fight podcast, he probably has a plaque cas, I don't think he has a podcast. No, he's carving a radio out of wood right now. Our raw rolling or Rio. Um, we talked about pornography last time, but I forget what we talked about. They have no idea it was that your son knew the term pornography from the Simpsons. And my son came up to me, said what's pornography? And I said, well that good, why do you know that? And he said, cause I was watching an episode of the Simpsons where they talk about pornography and it's an episode that you wrote. And that was an awkward dad moment for me because once you do, I said that's a different Conan O'brien. I'll go to your room.

Speaker 2:          23:33          I did. I said that I believe in the old school. I bet. I bet. I bet. Did you ever have your mouth washed out with soap as a child? No, I did. Oh my mouth washed out with soap. If you got a woman to look after us, who's from Prince Edward Island and even Murphy, she was old school and my parents weren't in the house and I said some word that wasn't supposed to say. I remember she took me into the bathroom and she put dial, she wet some dial soap and in and out of my mouth. And what? I remembered that it caked on the back of my teeth. Oh yeah. That really turned out okay. You did turn it around, right? Why did you write at the end of the question mark? You turned it around and then you said, right, you only meet, you don't want me to your house.

Speaker 2:          24:17          You only meet me in a public place and okay. And you said that you'd like other people to be there in case size suddenly become physically crazy. You said you'd like to be murdered. So I'm pretty sure that all the things I've said, you can just throw those out the window and let's just start with, you said you'd like to be Merck. That's true. That's pretty few creepy dude. Totally one. That's creepy. You one. Okay. I'm just, you looked around the room like other enough people here. Yes. You're fine. This isn't a trap. This isn't a trick. Won a Europe. You're allowed to leave at anytime. Okay. Let me use it anytime. Horrifying. I think that this podcast, we may end up only doing like two or three of these because my effort to find a real friend is it's a mirror that I'm looking into.

Speaker 2:          25:08          That's what I'm seeing. I'm seeing myself and I don't like what I see Wanda. I don't like what I see. A very sad and needy man. What are the things that you enjoy doing that you like to travel or when like when you'd take, take the show on the road and I love doing that. Well, do you travel outside of show? Yes. Yes. I do enjoy traveling. I do enjoy traveling. What do you like to go? Oh, I see what you're doing now. It is your podcast. I like this. Where do we like to go? I like to go. Uh, I love to go to Europe. I love to see things that are a lot older than I am. They call. It calms me down. When you see like a, when you're in a building that's like 800 years old, I just think, oh yeah, I don't matter.

Speaker 2:          25:50          In a good way. Not in a bad way. I think when, when I'm in cities that have been around when I'm in Jerusalem, I just think, what am I worried about? This has been here so long. We're all here for such a short time. Relax. I get a great perspective and it lasts for about 18 minutes and then I'm right back into, I can't make more of my TV shows and that's not enough. I need a podcast. I need even more than that. I must have more and so it's, it's tough. It's tough, but I love the perspective you get from, do you travel a lot? Go to Europe often France, and know my wife is French so it's quite to be with someone who speaks the language. I had to be a nice trip for the three of us. You, your wife and me in France, not hearing anything from you. This is the longest silence on a podcast.

Speaker 2:          26:47          It has been recorded. Thank yet I could stay in a separate hotel, but we would meet in the morning and we would spend the day with each other. Now you're just exhaling what a barge cruise in France. Yeah. You and cause you can hop on and off. Yes. And you go through the whole country. You can get off, grab a bike just so you can steal it, but you can take any bike. It's not a crime and crime. As long as you put a loaf of bread in the basket, it's not crime. A loaf of bread in the basket. And if, if you're going to be gone with the bike for like over three hours, you got to put a bra on.

Speaker 2:          27:26          You know they have, but they have it all worked out. That's what's great. Are you going to do that? You can take a barge cruise. We were looking into that. All right, well I'll look into it. I'll let you know. I'm going to wait by the phone. Okay. Until you call. All right. And I will go with you and we will travel on a barge going all the way to France. Maybe let's just start small like like maybe go to Canada first. You know like, Oh, I thought you were in Montreal. Montreal is nice. I thought you meant they do go there and test it. See if we, you know. Right. I was thinking when you said start small that we would stay in La. There is an La River and we could find a place, a part of it that has some water and we could probably go as far as like 50 or 60 feet and then get out and spray paint something on the tanks up there and then all run in different directions.

Speaker 2:          28:22          But yes, I think you're right. I think it's smart to test it out, test it out and see if we're all copacetic. We all get along. Yeah. Now I'm thinking, oh we can just go down to the all ball pawn, you know and and grandpa croissant. That's something I could do that. Okay, let's try that first. Let's try that first. We're going to do that. You're not, we're going to Wanda Sykes and I are going to go to an all album palm. Don't give him the address because which one? Don't tell them which one. Right. I don't want to see you get murdered. Well that's weird cause it's actually what I'm dreaming of to actually have all those guys standing around me and saying, wonder what happened. That's cool. Thank you so much. Thanks for coming in. Have you sometimes, right when you only one of your, your uh, investigation, Discovery Ryan there, flip over to bt and watch some black murder.

Speaker 2:          29:15          Really drama. What? Wait a minute. I know. I always, I don't know why, how we segregate murders. Somehow murder gets segregated. But wait a minute. How is the BC murder channel different call a fatal attraction? It's just black people getting murdered. But how would, how do you notice what's the, is there a cultural difference in murdering this? Usually infidelity. Infidelity. Like you're not going to see on, on the black murderer, you know, somebody killed their neighbor because the dog wouldn't stop barking. Best. Yeah. That's white murder. Murder. Also white people love to murder each other over insurance policies. Yes. And it's all, we don't have it. And it's, and it's, and it's always have show pilots and it's always for an incredibly, like there was an $800 deductible that he managed to get by killing his wife in a murder. That costume, $10,000 a, I'm going to do that. I'm going to start watching because as a country we need to come together. So I pledged to now start watching murder on the bet channel and I'm going to do that. It sounds like you think about that. I'll tell you when we're at the elbow pawn. Okay. That's a date date. Something you didn't think I could do it one is a tricky one, but I did it when it's like, thank you so much. Thank you. A pleasure and honor and uh, I hope to see you very, very soon and silence.

Speaker 4:          30:44          Oh,

Speaker 1:          30:49          and now it's time for another installment of Conan O'brien pays off the mortgage on his beach house.

Speaker 1:          31:01          Sony. You're aware that I've made some questionable hiring decisions in the past. Yes. You have. Would you consider yourself one of those? No, I would consider myself an excellent hiring choice. You were an excellent hiring choice. How long have you worked for me? Almost 10 years, right? You were great assistant for a year. The thing is, um, that's not nice. No, you were a great assistant and then you are an even greater assistant. There it is a nine. I'm waiting for the joke that inevitably follows. You're terrific assistant. There was no joke there. That was me being real. I don't know what to do. Well, first of all, you sure I'm being sincere. I look in my eyes. What do you see? Just pure evil.

Speaker 1:          31:42          Now you are a great hire, but you have to admit there was a chance that I wouldn't have found you. It was just pure luck, right? I just found you, taught you English, brought you to this country. It was like splash. You were like the mermaid that didn't know how to eat a lobster. Remember you taught me how to be a human. Yes. Oh, you love yourself. Oh God. If I could give myself an award right now, I would. The point is you don't want to leave these important hiring decisions to chance, which is why zip recruiter comes to mind. I don't know why it comes to mind, might be this piece of paper and in front of me that says ZipRecruiter read verbatim, but ZipRecruiter comes to mind because they find candidates for you. That's what they do. They find uh, qualified candidates for you.

Speaker 1:          32:34          They have this powerful matching technology. Ziprecruiter was rated number one by employers in the US. That's a true fat cause. It's on this piece of paper. And so when I go to zip recruiter, now Sona, God forbid I ever have to replace you in a month. What? But in a month I'll use zip recruiter in a month. I'm saying God forbid, but you're seeing a specific timeline. It's more like five weeks. I feel as though you have planned something. I have not, but I've found ZipRecruiter to be excellent at finding your replacement. Should I ever need that person? His name is Kyle. I don't like Kyle. Well, he's terrific. Thank you ZipRecruiter right now my listeners can try ZipRecruiter for free, for free. Beat that at this exclusive web address. Zip recruiter.com/conan if you like the show, show your support to it. And ZipRecruiter by going to zip recruiter.com/conan that. And it says spelled out C. O. N. A. N. This is humiliated. That's zip recruiter.com/conan C o. N. A. N. Ziprecruiter is the smartest way to hire. That's not their slogan. That's when I just thought of that. I'm giving to zip recruiter

Speaker 2:          33:57          one. Uh, one followup question, Wanda, on a scale of basically one to 10, 10 being best, what do you think are your chances or the, the likelihood of being friends with Conan. And after that discussion I would say, and you can speak freely. He's not in the room, right? Right. Um, how would go and say like, uh, uh, 6.5 you feel safe with him? I feel safe with him. Oh God, no. Oh, I will have a weapon on me. Okay, good. Alright. Yeah. So 6.5 with a weapon. Well put that little asterisk, 6.5 with a weapon and then your weapon of choice and he packing heat. Okay. Thank you very much.

Speaker 4:          34:33          Huh?

Speaker 1:          34:39          Now it's time for Conan gives a performance review. Can I give a performance review of how you just said, now it's time for Conan to give a performance review, which I think is a better way to say it then what you said. I'm impressed. This is not your native language and I'm an in very impressed. It is actually my second language. So yeah, this joke's on you. I'm impressed that you note seven languages. I know. Three. Okay. How many do you know? Um, I am impressed. I was saying I am impressed. I only know five. So good for you. Now it's time for Conan to give a performance review. All right. I have a very good staff. I want to start by saying that and uh, but I think one of the reasons we have such a good staff is that I'm, well, I'm tough on them and uh, I let them know when they've let me down and uh, I also like to praise them.

Speaker 1:          35:32          So it's the whole rainbow of emotions, but more putting down and praising. I see the face from making, yeah. Today, we're going to give a performance review to someone who's been on my staff a very long time. Aaron Blair. Erin, what would you say is your title on the show? I don't even know. I don't know either. You're the web guy. Yeah, I'll you when people ask, I say web guy. You're a web guy. You A, you've been with me a long time. Anyone who's watched my clueless gamers. That's a Aaron [inaudible]. Aaron, you've been with the show. How long? Oh my God. I started as an intern in 2001 that you started in 2001 you were a young kid at the time. It's still gray hair though. Yes. You've always had, you've had gray hair. You look like Newt Gingrich when you were 14 years old. That's true.

Speaker 1:          36:16          It is. It's incredible. Yeah. You know, I felt like I made it work. You know, you do. You make it. I wasn't criticizing you in any way. I was just saying it was striking that you had this gray hair and I thought, oh my God, Newt Gingrich's walking around the office. Oh wait, no. That's a 14 year old boy. You have completely gray hair. Yes. Okay. And you'll have a completely gray beard. Right? But then it is colored dark brown, right. Your mustache and right. Just below where your chin goes, it looks like you're a gray haired person who stuck his face into a bowl of cocoa to take a sip. So my question is, are you coloring that part? No. Why would I call her this part? Because it's so, I don't understand how this is color, the whole thing. Why? Who? Why would I'm asking you?

Speaker 1:          37:13          Well know to answer your question. No, I'm not coloring that part. That's just what God has given me. But so do you know what you're talking about? That a little unusual looking, doesn't it look like he dipped down? There was some, there was a hole in the ice. He was walking through the woods with completely gray beard. There was a hole in the ice. He dipped down and saw a chocolate stream running under the ice, but the whole would only accommodate an area slightly larger than his mouth. So he dipped down to sip it and it got his mustache and the bottom of his, his chin get beards. So let's talk about you and your performance. You have done a lot. I'll go on. Uh, on the record and play was one of the first people to push me to, uh, to expand my foolishness onto the internet and to shoot silly little things.

Speaker 1:          38:01          And uh, and you do a spectacular job. You want us, uh, an Emmy for your work. So you would think too, I want to settle down power of saying, okay, I've got one of those too. No, I got you two of them. I know. All right. Oh, you got them from me. Well, I'm, you got me. I didn't. You got me using your work. Why don't you touch my work is in the clay that you have get. Oh my got you to Emmy. No, I got you two. Don't get, I, you hell do you think you are? You've won yourself too mean. What do you want us, what do you want me to say? Yes. How about despite you, this is going despite you. I just want it just, man, I was about to give you such a good performance review when you know you're doing an amazing job.

Speaker 1:          38:49          And I, and I do mean that sincerely. I have a few notes for you. Oh boy. You know, I think that you sometimes on camera are way too loud and Jess and you clap your hands a lot and you act like you are running a children's show and you yell and we do a lot of live streams together and you really are sometimes acting like a circus performer who knows that he has seconds to live if he, if he doesn't, uh, amp up the energy is just a little more. So I'm telling you to, as you've got to calm down just a little bit. Right. Okay. You comfortable getting that feedback? I mean it's, you've given me this feedback quite a bit and in public many times. Yes. So, uh, now can I just say, I realize I'm being loud. Can I explain, you know what I'd never get, and this is great, I never get the chance to explain, I to not talk back to you, but whatever.

Speaker 1:          39:43          The nice way to say that is I explained my position. Okay. And I'm glad we have this form so I can do this because what happens is you realize if this starts to go south on me at any point that we'll cut this off. I'm s I will, I'll just shop and go ahead. Go ahead. When we're doing a livestream or something, my voice sounds crazy. You're yelling right? Cause I'm very amped up. Okay. They're adjusting dials all across this building engineer's week. Yeah, they're pulling levers. It's like that scene where the Titanic's just about to hit the iceberg and they're, they're turning giant wheels and they're shoving huge levers into reverse to try and veer us back into a normal sonic level. But go ahead. Shouter I uh, did a lot of choir when I was younger I project. Okay. Don't laugh at that.

Speaker 1:          40:27          So I had to turn away. Why is that funny? Choir is a thing. You know, he was the gray hair. He was the gray haired boy and the choir was tenor second tenor. Yeah, that was the second, second tenor here. It's like a time and I'm just saying, so I naturally project quite a bit to do now to two live streams. I feel like people are watching on their phones very small. You have to overcompensate really to get it out. You know, look, be like to do it right. So bored. You're looking at me with like dead eyes. No, I'm, well first of all, I died inside in a long time ago. Okay. So I feel like I have to overcompensate for that. So I feel like that's what it takes. It's all brute force. I don't have your talents of being hilarious, so I have to be just energetic.

Speaker 1:          41:15          I'm going to say you are a funny fellow will second. And uh, I don't, don't let yourself down. That's my job. Not to put you down a chocolate stream. Um, I understand. And I also, I have to say, I do appreciate that. That always gives me something to start with whenever we're doing something right. And I come into a room and you're doing a livestream and you're yelling, that's the first thing I do. And, and it's so it's a little like peanut butter and Jelly. It works well together and then you punch me for the next 20 minutes. I do it. Here's another thing I do. I punch a you often because you're a big guy and you can take a punch just like punch you a lot in the shoulder. Uh, then your parents didn't like it. That's true. He didn't like that I was punching you.

Speaker 1:          41:54          It's true. And here's a negative performance review for you. You commit. You communicated that to me. Now I think you should have just kept that to yourself. But I think you telling me that your parents don't like it when I punched you, I thought that was putting me in a very uncomfortable emotional position as the person punching it was awesome. This is the most ridiculous complaint. I want to punch you, but I don't want to hear any negative comments from your family. Uh, well, only what? My Dad didn't like it. My mom says that like, do it more. She enjoys it. Your mom likes it when they change. She enjoys it. Yes. Uh, and I, you want to explain to me, uh, that, uh, coming from brothers very early on, to your credit, you said, I'm going to hit you quite a bit.

Speaker 1:          42:44          It's because I, it's because I can't hit my brothers. Uh, so I'm gonna hit you because they're not within the arms. Like there are certain writers that I'm comfortable tackling fighting, which is ridiculous and absurd. Yes. Um, and I know that they're okay with it. Yes. I think they're okay with it. I may ask them someday if they're okay with it. There was, there's one, or particularly, I remember, uh, I was either an internet just started and I walked by and the old, late night offices, he, he, he, you had been fighting and you've have his head whose head? Michael Coleman, his head we used to play with a lot. Uh, Oh, you're holding it down on the desk. And as I walked by, you go, hey, hey, come here. Come here. I was like, yeah, you go hold his head here. Just hold it here. And if I walked by and his head is not on the thing and you're not holding it, you're fired.

Speaker 1:          43:30          I was like, oh my God. And so I held it for like 30 seconds and he goes, he's just kidding. And I was like, oh. And I love Michael Coleman, brilliant writer. But he had that coming. I love Michael Coleman, but a, and I fully admit to that kind of madness. I'm an insane person. And he ripped your shirt. That's why that happened. He, he, they can't wear my shirt. Enraged me. Yes. Uh, let's move on to areas that won't get me in legal trouble. Um, you were ironic watches constantly. That's true. Every day you were at different. Ironic watch just is true. This is a negative part of your performance review. Sometimes you wear a watch where all the numbers are scrambled or you'll wear a watch that has no numbers or your war where a watch that has no information but just a pancake on it.

Speaker 1:          44:16          That's true. Yeah. This is my grandpa's watch. I, uh, that's a real watch. It's ironic. It's strange that it's weird that I'm bringing this up today because this is one of the only times I've seen you wear a watch that isn't made to look like a mini toilet seats or oh look, it's a steaming piece poop and it stops steaming at 1230 limited. We'll show you exactly what is the watch thing. Uh, I don't know. You know, I'm a wacky guy. Never say that. Well, you know, I mean, okay. I'm not a wacky guy. I enjoy, uh, I enjoy color and I enjoy, uh, I think, I mean a psychologically is probably, well, you know what guys don't get to a word jewelry, we don't get no, it's true. And guys don't really get to dress up like I, you know, it's like, oh, you wear like a time we didn't do when you're older.

Speaker 1:          45:05          I have appreciated dressing up a little more as I am wearing a tie right now. We can't. You are, and you look, that's all, that's all I'm wearing. Your kid, you can't think on its long. Anyway, the point is, you know what? So I wear to ironic watch because I want somebody across the room to be able to see, see the kind of person I am from far away. Okay. Here's the next part of your performance review. We're doing very well on the Internet, don't you think? I would say so, yes. Okay. Why am I not much bigger on the Internet? And I think in your huge, no, no, no, no. I mean I think there's a lot you must not be doing. I want to be the ultimate because you know, we're not a car Dashi and levels. Okay. Okay. And you know what I'm going to say, let's be honest.

Speaker 1:          45:44          Let's be honest. You know, this is going to be great. I can't wait to hear what you're about to say. Well, all I know is every time I turn on SONA, jump in. When I, when I turn on my phone or my computer, I see what the Kardashians are up to or who they're dating or hold it, who threw shade at Black China and who does Travis Scott and who, uh, got a new butt and stuff like that. And I'm thinking I've got a new, but you know why? Why are, why am I not part of that discussion? Anybody and I think I blame, go ahead. They show their boobs a lot. And you that's what I was going to say. Do not use saying that they are considered sexier than I am. More sexual. Uh, yes, they are definitely sexier. They have, you know, very voluptuous bodies and they show it off.

Speaker 1:          46:32          I mean if you show like you're but more often and like a thong, be honest. Be Honest. Tell them that I about my butt. Tell them you don't seem to have one. They have, there's nothing. There is literally nothing there. Yeah, but you know what? It is a straight drop. I had a carpenter check it out. My blood. Not only does it not go out, it goes in. Oh you can, there's like a, an area where you can, there's just a big carved out indentation there. I can't keep pants on. Why did a carpenter check out? You know, can I say one of the best things? Not best things. One of the very popular things we did was when you were jeggings, you remember that? Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. If you were some tight like to Sona, say if you showed that off, even if you've got nothing, here's the problem.

Speaker 1:          47:18          Show it off. You know, like here's the thing. Why did you say, even if he got nothing. Well, I'm saying if you, well, I dunno, I'm saying, I'm saying maybe it should be a little sexier. You know, it might be just come out and you come out in a suit every day, you know, try, try maybe the jacket, no shirt. Gold goes well, I'm just throwing, I'm just, I'm just spit balling. He seen my chest prefer not if you've seen my chest would really like not to. I look like someone I don't want. My chest is uh, you know, a sunken chest. Um, it's the chest of someone who's been in the coal mines for many, many years. Yeah. So I don't know if you showed it off. I guaranteed there is a fetish for everything. People would be into the sunken chest, like Deron not, well, they might not be the people you want, but you know, sunken chest fetish.

Speaker 1:          48:07          Here's the good end of that. You're in charge or uh, you know, you are at the helm of my web presence in many regards. Why are you not figuring out a way for me to break the Internet? I think we've broken it. Guest is doing well. What more do you want? What would he be? Don't ever ask me what more do I want more? But would you want to be what the head of a country like? What are you looking for out of the vendor? When Kim Kardashian had that picture that showed her opening champagne and the stream of champagne was going up in the air, do you remember that? And then it made an ark in the air and then it landed on her butt. Crack has a, but you can't do that. It goes straight to the floor. You can't do this champagne on the buck.

Speaker 1:          48:49          You have nothing. Photoshop. Thank you. She also shows off like on a private plane and really fancy leather chairs. And here's my new book about the people who live in bogs in 1910 and what they ate. I took a, I took a Selfie, to be fair, I was in a on a u s air flight that was fairly uh, unoccupied and I took a self portrait of me writing in my journal and I gave that to, to put on the Internet. And then I waited for the whole thing to blow up. Remember US Air Flight? What is that? Anytime. That's nothing. Look where you were, you know you are in business. You weren't even in first. You know what? First costs on us, but I'm just saying you weren't, that's not like bling bling, you know, life saying, but okay, so you're saying I have to get on like a southwest flight and be in the front?

Speaker 1:          49:45          Yeah. You should check in very early for this point. You're misled. He's missing them. You know what? Here's what you need here. It's just, it's the internet runs on everything else. Its sex appeal. It's its popularity. It's thrown at you. What was the last time you threw shade at somebody? So and don't you think he should start a feud? Well, you need is, you need it. You need a beef. That's what you, how about I go after taiga? You don't know who taiga is. You know, you keep saying, I don't know who target is, but I will tell you I have a lot of beef with Tyga. Well, what about like, who's somebody who you like? Well, Hey, you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg, like who's somebody who you know a lot about don don't beef with, no, no, don't be, but what about if you beef with like a, but somebody who you know a lot about who's still alive, who's cool, who's still alive?

Speaker 1:          50:29          Yeah, like somebody like I know like Taf. Do you have, don't you have issues with Taft? Who's the, you said still alive, but no, I was saying mean you're the first person you lift. You just listed as, no, no. I mean what if I'm the first person to have beef with a historical figure, but they can't be. They can't be if, no, but I think this is the, hold on, just settle down. Here's the problem with you. You don't think, what if I get into a beef? You know, I can't get into beef with Tyga because I don't know who would tag is all about and I can't get into a beef with black machina and you know what I mean? And, and uh, you know, Kendrick Lamar and all these different people, I can't get into beef with them because no one's going to, they're not going to know who I am.

Speaker 1:          51:05          It's the whole thing's not going to work. But what if I'm the first person who starts to have legitimate beef with, you know, I've got a beef with Hamilton fish know fish. Exactly. Look it up. Everyone look up Hamilton fish or look up, uh, you know, Lsu route. I have beef with him. He was in Theodore Roosevelt's administration. No, I have, I have beef with Czar Nicholas, you know, or the people last czar of Russia. I have may, you know, I have major, he shouldn't have dissolved the Duma then as ever. Maybe the Russian revolution wouldn't have happened. I'm here in a future segment for this podcast. I know gold when I hear it and that this blows up code because then we get someone to start writing back to me. Right. In the voice of that person. Right. You know? Yeah. I just have a, I have major beef with Hubert Humphrey.

Speaker 1:          51:59          Yeah. Uh, and then he has beef with me back. I have major beef, it's called major beef, but major feat definitely called major beef. I have major beef with Secretary of State Seward from the Lincoln Administration. No. Yeah. I don't think he should have purchased Alaska and I consider it Seward's folly. And this is the kind of stuff that, okay, I know what you're all thinking moves stupid. You would learn from my beef, my beef would educate educational beef. Yeah. It's educational beef. We want to learn from your major beef from my beef. Would you learn? Yes. You would all learn from my beef. Okay. But would think man Conan, secretary of state's Seward or really getting into it and then kids will just, because they're into beef, start to know about, maybe Seward shouldn't have bought Alaska. It'll be so big. The Kardashians, we'll want to be on you and be like, no, you're not historically significant enough.

Speaker 1:          52:54          Exactly. Yeah, exactly. So I, uh, we're going to do that and that's going to blow up. That's going to break the Internet. Major beef like major beef. Okay. Wrap up this performance review. Yes, please play. You are an excellent, uh, and crucial part of my team. Thank you. Sometimes you speak too loudly. I wish you took your watches more seriously. What would you, what would you rate me? What's the scale and how would I rate on the scale of, of, of your performance of the show? Yeah. Like what is it? What do you rate? What am I rated out of? Okay. Uh, the scale is eight stars. Okay. And I'm giving you six stars. Okay. Uh, plus half a moon. Okay. It's confusing, but it works out too. That's very good. Oh, well thank you. It's not the perfect. All right.
