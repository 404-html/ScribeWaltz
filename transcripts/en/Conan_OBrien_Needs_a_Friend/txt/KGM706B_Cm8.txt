Speaker 1:          00:03          Hi, my name is Pete Holmes and I feel frustrated but honored to be Conan O'brien's Fred.

Speaker 2:          00:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15          Ah,

Speaker 3:          00:20          back to school.

Speaker 1:          00:37          Hey there. Welcome to Conan O'brien needs a friend. It's pretty simple. This is the show where I Conan O'brien, uh, talk to people in the business, a celebrities I've interviewed over the years and trying to find out is it possible we could be real friends, not just fake show Biz pals. Now I'm aided in my quest by my assistant for now sona. [inaudible] hello. Come on Sony. You know, you're with me for the long haul. Yeah. But it's hard to really believe that when you constantly keep talking about how my time's limited. You see that often? I like to dangle that because I think that will inspire you to greater heights. Do you think it's working? No, it is not. No, I don't think so. Either. A Elsa, someone who I give a shout out to my producer, Matt Gorley. Matt, how are Ya? I'm good. And I think because you don't threaten my job, it makes me actually worried that maybe it is a short tenure here.

Speaker 1:          01:27          Yeah. Your replacement is standing behind you. Oh, his name is Phillip. Hi Phil. I call you Gourley a lot. I don't know why you might not like that. You just fine. Is it okay? I mean, he could call you Matt. I have so many maps in my life, but I only have one Gourley I, yeah, I'm, I'm, you're one Gourley I don't like Matt Anyway. All right. Gourley thanks for being here. You do a great job. Well, that's nice. I'm not sure that's true, but uh, no, it's true. Okay. I do think this podcast is doing very well. You're probably a big part of that. Uh, no, that's, this is all you guys. Yeah, I'm just putting it through filters and shit. Okay. I think that's true. [inaudible] Gourley is the magic spice. He's the secret. He's the colonel's secret recipe. We're all holding hands right now. Oh No, we're not. It would violate somebody's hand. Right? We were just told you're just holding a severed hand. Oh my God. Today I'm talking to someone. Uh, have a lot of admiration for

Speaker 3:          02:28          Pete Holmes. Oops.

Speaker 1:          02:30          What I'm liking about this so far. You've been doing this a long time and it's completely the way you and I would talk. Yes. Uh, without any interference, right. Without, uh, and, and the show. Do you feel like when you do the show that there's levels of interference? Do you think that's getting close? Yeah. Cause you're quite relaxed on the show. Well, I really appreciate it. It's one of the great thrills of my life that I've done your show enough times to be relaxed. Certainly the first time I was, you know, Jimmy and my bridgies

Speaker 4:          03:01          trying to get some new freight and new phrase is going, me and my, well, there was a kid in my neighborhood, Jimmy's, how do we know that type of narcissism I exhibit? I make jokes that don't have any, I know you don't know. How could you do that? You just said, I'm Jimmy and my bridges and I was like, wow, I feel stupid because that's clearly a classical reference, a Shakespearean drama. And then it turns out no, Jimmy from my neighborhood. How could you not know that it's all Baloney? It was just fun words. My mom will do that though. Oh wait. Or I'll come like you and I will be talking about the bread and won't be like, Eh. The spreads pretty old and then the waiter will come who wasn't privy to that and she'll be like, Laurie, let's say we said the bread was dry and then she's like the waiter. I'll say to my mom, you want some water? And she'll be like, what am I the Brad to him? I'm always like, mom, he doesn't have the info. He doesn't just a crazy person and was like, what did I bread?

Speaker 4:          03:58          And then he calls an EMT and says, women's having a stroke, a stroke. This, no, let's not do stroke, but it's too many people having strokes. Really. Right. I don't know. I'm going to keep doing them until I have one. No, it is a funny Goto, but I was going to say that a stroke kind of sound like it's a stroke. You stroke a cat. It's kind of Nice. Nobody's like, Hey, quit struggling my cat. You stroke a cab or you stroke your gentlemen lover. Okay. Let me tell you something. Give them a stroke if you're working on a new honk and I sense that's what you're doing. If you're gonna do this stroke bit, stroke a cat, what are you a stroke? A stroke. It sound like such a nice thing. A Straw. Oh my God, it is a Seinfeld bit. You strong again.

Speaker 4:          04:39          Hey, I had a question on your boyfriend. This is a bit I've wanted to do for awhile. How are we? Great idea. It's a stroke of genius. Yeah, I forced it. Yeah, no, but she's the thing. Here's what, here's a bit that I want to work on, which is how are we going to know when Jerry Seinfeld has Alzheimer's? Holy cause. He's going to come out on stage and go, I just want to know who all these people bad. What is the deal with pizza? And people are going to first think that Jerry is working on, they're going to think he's working on new material.

Speaker 5:          05:08          No, sue, who are these big Cheri? These are your loved ones. Oh No, I'm scared. I'm lost in the corridors of my own mind. Who are these people? Jerry. Jerry, calm down, pump terrified, everything around me. What is this thing that, that's a window. Jerry, what does a window

Speaker 4:          05:34          and then it ends with it ends with you. You see it's a window and then he goes, that was a bit, no one was a bit, you know Wednesday night I call those playground bits where they're like you have the premise, you can do it forever but then no you have to have that chord that you Paul and then yeah I'm not telling you what to do. I'm no, no period. I just this my telling what to do or no, I just did this 18 city tour and I have this hump that I do up front and then I thought of that on the road and working it out in front of the comedians that are like, that's really funny. But I never did it on stage cause I thought I don't know yet. But I've, but it might be because you don't, you didn't know where the court is.

Speaker 4:          06:12          Yeah. The end. I wonder if real like Vaudevillian Showbiz is going to come back cause we're all loose where the podcast generation of comedy where it's like even your talk show you can be transparent. People are like we're seeing behind the curtain. I wonder if the curtain is going to make a comeback if our our kids kids are going to be like it came out he was partly, it's like John Malaney, John Malania just does stand up. John's not like, and that's how that one ends. He doesn't, doesn't do that. He is a throwback. He is a throwback and that's a high compliment. He is. He's a very disciplined storyteller and joke teller and he crafts his act in this way. That's a little out of time for today because, and again it's, there are people that abuse the privilege. There are comics that have their shit together and then the ones that are very brilliant but they, they kind of wallow in, I don't really know where this is going and I am I really doing up here and comment on everything and sometimes it goes too far.

Speaker 4:          07:14          Of course. I think what we're talking about, his podcast standup, it's like, now that they know that we, we talk about bits and these ways they left. I can't speak for everybody, but some audiences like it. You're like, you go see Mark Marin who's, you know, the pen ultimate. What does that mean? Second to second to last? I think he is. Well now he is the next one. It's over. Yeah, I meant the consummate. Yeah. Podcast. Stand up. You know, he is the Punam Bro. I know what you're saying. It depends on person. He's Jimmy. And is that just, yeah, he's the pneumatic. I know what you're saying. Are these the Paris, the populace? Uh, I'm just going to say it like, Oh God, how are we gonna you know, this is a, it's a disaster. What I'm saying is when you watch him 80% of it, it's just like, I don't, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          08:02          You know, like, and we love it. Like that's what makes it fun is that he's not doing, because he's not supposed to be doing what Malania is doing well and he's doing what he's supposed to be doing, where he's doing what he's supposed to be doing. I do wonder if your kids, kids will be like, it came out from the cut and then he said, well good evening ladies and gentlemen. You know what I mean? Like sitting at like lit up cocktail tables and we just want to show up. Be Nice. Sometimes it is nice. I'm gonna add some professionalism to this. We do have something in common. We're both from the Boston area. We're both tall. Yes. We are both bedeviled by our fathers.

Speaker 3:          08:37          Aye.

Speaker 4:          08:41          Come on. I've met your dad. Your Dad's quite the character Carlo. Right? His mother. That's my dad. I know Gregory and giving me some wins your cookie 10 minutes later. I never had a, when Joe called me, well this is the thing about your dad used to do an impression of him and I thought it was a cruel exactly. And then I met him and it's really not. That is an accurate, were you a bystander and you were describing him to police and you weren't related to him? That would be an accurate description. A sloppy Peter Griffin type. When you, when I had the talk show that you did, my dad was that you gave me, my dad was in the audience and I was interviewing rob Corddry. My Dad by the way, wore a red sox jersey. Yup. Tivas and he has like, I love my dad, but he's got some fucked up feet.

Speaker 4:          09:40          His feet look like, who like wouldn't start at Luke Skywalker was in that pit, that Jabba the Hutt but have been in the monster, came out, they looked like a rang Gore ran core. Why would you even know her? I oh good. I nerd in the corner. He's got rang core feet and he, and he was like, I'm going to put a legion Kiva, so whatever's growing on him and can get some air and you know, grow better. So he's got these nibs, the mangled kind of white old man Bostonian Tivo sang. Kelly's tell me that he was in a war. He was never in a war. Never in a war. Convenient. A war is the good out for everything. I was in the war if you're out. Yup. But no, he was his feet never saw action. No. So why are they mad? Did they get dropped into machinery?

Speaker 4:          10:23          It's no, they're just there. They grew weird. He has what's called a hammer toe. Not Mc, not MC. No one thought of MC and everyone thought of Mc, not a person in this room. So a you're saying is he's in the audience, I'm sorry. Yeah, he's in the audience and I'm interviewing Rod, Rob Corddry. He's also wearing cargo shorts. So this is kind of thin chicken legs. He's got like Shrek Body, Big Dad bought it, I'm sure of chicken legs. Yup. Ran core feet. You basically, you know that game. Where will you fold a piece of paper three times and you draw the defeat and then you've hold it and then someone else not seeing the feet, legs and then you pass it and then someone else draws the, the, the, the mid body and then the final person draws the head and then you unfold it and you all made a body together.

Speaker 4:          11:07          You're saying that your dad is the product of that game. Exactly. Somebody's got stoned and drew my dad with five friends and so I'm interviewing Rob Corddry, my dad, my mom and my brother both dressed up. My Dad's dressed like he's just leaving, not even a baseball game, like a batting cage. Like he was hitting some balls and that we're, I'm interviewing rob Corddry and I hear him. It made the show. He goes, who is this guy? Well, I'm interviewing nothing rod ropes, not t crews, but I'm interviewing rob Gourdie. I'm telling the people who carry crews carry crew or Tom Cruise. Okay. God, you abbreviate everything. He, he was humiliating. Rob Corddry, rob Corddry ran with it to hilarious effect. These clips are available on Youtube. I'm here to plug the clips of our old doctrine. You know what they'll live on forever. That's the beautiful thing. Isn't that fun? Well, what happens too is you've gone on, you've had this other success. People know you. Yeah. Well established guys. So then they may say, I liked this Pete Holmes and then they start looking and then people start posting. Yes, your talk show, which was very funny and so I'm sorry if it was very cool about it. They gave us a hard drive with all of it. They were very cool about it. And then Jeff Ross, your Jeff Ross. Yeah. Pretty Nice.

Speaker 5:          12:24          Watch that fucking hat. You'll look like you're going to go mop up a bowling alley in the 1930s when Oprah Winfrey, bro, you look like fair hang a six shooter from now. Why? Why Berg Comedian Jeffrey Ross never has to do with set again

Speaker 4:          12:49          cause she can just play that with a tape recorder and hold it near his mouth. That was amazing because you think about Cheryl comedian Jeffrey Ross a lot. No, not often. Okay. Wow. It's amazing. I have texted, tried to text your producer Jeff Ross and texted Jeff Ross and I've tried to vice versa. Jeff Ross, my producer at shares a name with comedian Jeff Ross and Jay for years. Jeff Ross would get comedian Jeff Ross mail all the time and vice versa. Yeah, it's, I knew it wasn't him cause he wasn't right.

Speaker 5:          13:19          You fat, lesbian route.

Speaker 4:          13:23          Hello? [inaudible] this is Jeff Ross. Yeah. Yeah. My Jeff Ross, a producer of our show. Not a fan of comedy. Do you think that's possible? I think it is. Yeah. I think he is. He's a great producer. One of the things, he is professional, he's an amazing producer. He's the only producer. Everyone I work with. I suspect sometimes he is not a fan of comedy. Yeah. Cause I'll be making sense from, I think some pretty funny stuff. He's like, this is just wrap it up. Let's go this route. Okay, enough kidding around. And then with your jokes, let's get on with the ponytail. Enzyme. Yes, he is in his, your this. He's the thing that helps us digest that. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah. So you take a porn producer that is an Intersex, he's just like, and then the breasts come out and then the asas shimmering. Right. And it wiggles a little bit because people seem to like that. And then they, they, he is a born producer who's not that into sex. That's the only way that I understand that they liked the jiggling breasts. Right. And that he just studying. And in that analogy, I am a male porn star with a massive penis. Yes. Yes. Who is very good at sac.

Speaker 4:          14:29          Maybe some say the best at sex ever. And sometimes in a rough spot would call an Andy rector to help him finish. He's got a feather.

Speaker 5:          14:40          Hey Andy, shut that fan.

Speaker 4:          14:46          Ah, you've completely derailed my podcasts and I regret happening. You have not derailed anything. I, yeah. You know, here's what I gonna say. I, it's something I admire about you, Pete. Can I call you? Pete said, all right, you're always insisting on Dr. Holmes. That's my brother's wrap bruiser name. Is that true? No fool. And Dr. Holmes 33 wait, your brothers, what? My brother John Holmes make a joke. Go ahead and make a joke. Nope. My father also John Home. Yup. Uh, is one of the things that he does is he produces beats for underground rappers are used to do it more. He might still do it, but you can look them up. Dot. He's a white guy from Boston. He's a white man from Boston. Yes. Says yes. And he produces beats for rappers. Yeah, he's good at it. You know what he does? I think so. From what I can tell, it's a, it's certainly a hard, hard game to get into now.

Speaker 4:          15:40          Is there anyone in your lineage? It's got the comedy thing. My uncle Larry was hilarious. It was super, super funny and my mom and my dad are funding, but now nobody, they're like, if my dad comes home filthy and I think he likes that he's got like an old school like you can child like my back hurts. Like he thinks that's great and my hands are so soft. Could massage a seal and it'd be like mommy. Right. I think it was his mother. He knows you're a hard worker. He told me that. That's the city. He said, uh, he said, I'm not going to do your dad's accent, but he said, because it wouldn't sound right. But he said, uh, I'll tell you one thing about Pete, no one that no one can out work them. Oh, that's very sweet. He said that, and he was telling and I was like, stop talking to me about Pete.

Speaker 4:          16:22          I actually don't fully relate to that. I wonder how you are. I think, uh, I would, will you describe me? So now my, I think I'm a hard worker. You're a very hard worker. Yeah. Conan O'brien can't stop. And I'm very different from that. And that's how we clashed a lot. Sometimes it's, I, it's not that I don't work hard, it's that I don't, don't care as much as you do. Right. I care so much about everything and can't, and then I get mad because I care so much about everything and I wish I didn't. And I try not to, but then I still care so much. And Sona has always been the voice of, Eh, I didn't do it. Well, why didn't you do it? Well, this is the Internet. I didn't care and I'll be like, Woah, what do you mean you didn't care?

Speaker 4:          17:06          Right. That I think when I watched the documentary, yeah. Ryan can't stop it. It doesn't make me a little bit, it makes me a little bit sad because I see myself in it. You know what I mean? That part of us that's always sort of chasing the next thing or whatever. But you know, there's also part of me that's like, I think neither of us, cause I relate more to that than to sona wouldn't trade it. You know what I mean? Like if you could turn it off as a pill you could take right now. That's, well that's the big question is if there was a way to turn it off, I would turn it off and then quickly turn it back on again. You know? And uh, so I'm always signing up for way too much work then complaining that I have so much work. I remember you saying

Speaker 1:          17:50          that and that is like when I'm making the show, I want to be on vacation when I'm on vacation. I missed making the shout out. Yeah. Oh Wow. That's a long time. It's a terrible way to live your life.

Speaker 4:          18:01          I don't know if it is because it's one of the cheaper fuels that runs the machine and make no mistake that work that sometimes we both dread has incredible highs. Yeah. He's incredible highs. It's the addiction to the highs and the lows. I think there's even a part of us, I can speak from my experience that enjoys when I'm like, oh you and said, my job is putting my soul in the wood chipper of show business. And I think about that all the time. But there's a, there's a, there's a beautiful, it's almost like a French like appreciation for like, can you see what they make us give? We kind of like it. Oh No. That's the other thing too is that they're not making us. That's right. That's right. That's a narrative. But comes back. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:43          To me is, um, there's this moment of real clarity. I think it's in the documentary, which I haven't watched in years, but there was this moment where I come back stage, I lay it on the screen. Yeah. I come backstage and I'm complaining to my wife and I'm saying, they make are making me do this and they are making me do that. And she said there is no they, there's just, there's you, you're doing it. And I realize that that's the, the filmmaker who made that documentary called it Conan O'brien can't stop. And I, when he told me that was the title, I honestly didn't know what he was talking about. Hilarious. And then saw the documentary and it was like, oh it's this, you know, it's really strange to see a mirror held up to you. That's that accurate and not bad. I'm not, I didn't think I was.

Speaker 1:          19:34          Um, but it was, it was just interesting. It's just interesting to see the new England thing. But maybe we were both probably raised, I've thought about this. You and I grew up in New England and it's dark and cold in the morning and when you go out to go to school, the crappy car doesn't turn over cause it's so cold and it's dark. And my mom is making us say, Hail Mary so that the car will turn over. And she actually knew the name of the saint. You're supposed to pray to WHO's good with cars, which is ridiculous cause all the saints existed 2000 years ago. But there's one, there's like a saint Marcus or something who's good with transmissions. And my mom would make us pray to that saint and then the car would slowly turn over. And there's something about growing up in it like that. And I have thought to myself, what if you could take a Pete Holmes in a Conan O'brien and recast them so that they're born, uh, in Santa Barbara and we serve, we walked barefoot to school, we walked barefoot, we, we chill, there's a lot of wood. We, uh, we, we maybe start smoking some weed like it, is it possible that we would be different people? Like I always thought if grew up in southern

Speaker 4:          20:48          California, what I have had like a v shape torso in a girlfriend when I was 14 and what I have not had acne and what I have just been this chill guy. And what would I be doing now? I'd, I'd, well I have pictures of me on the Cape and I was like blond haired and I had a 10 like I don't Tan now. That goes a little as felt. I've been soft ever since. Like a svelte little boy. And I was like, maybe that's California Pete. But the question is, is California peep funny? I don't know. I could see you on Venice Boulevard. Like not working out, but maybe giving surf lessons or something. No, but I that wouldn't have worked either. My center of gravity is way too hot. I've got a disproportionate by all. But, but I have wondered that is there's so much, if there's a new England thing and look at all the new England comics, the real club comics.

Speaker 4:          21:34          Yeah. You know that it's so harsh. I know you're really funny, but it's, everything's fucked up. It's a product of roads that were designed for horse and buggy. We had dinner one time around Christmas. Yep. In downtown. But that's what I love. That's a new Boston like a new, cause that's not the Boston u and I grew up, that's what I mean. We didn't go downtown and that's right. And eating a fancy restaurant. When I was a kid, we went to, we went to a place called Tony's Italian villa on route nine and now I know that is not an Italian restaurant, but that's where we went and we just got to have one soda. And that was my brother Neil always tricked me into drinking mine really quickly. He'd go, let's have a race and, and then I would drink mine really fast and he wouldn't drink his at all. And then he'd laugh at me the rest of the meal. Oh Jesus. If ever I love the me. And now it's time for a segment called Conan O'Brien pays off the mortgage on his beach house. Yes. I believe in being honest with people. Took out a big mortgage than borrowed against that mortgage. Then borrowed against it again, mistake. But uh, I'm an adult and I'm going to pay down that mortgage and we're going to take care of that right now.

Speaker 4:          22:53          There's some hidden little chip in us that makes us, we know we don't consciously know it, but subconsciously we know we're not staying here. Yeah. That's how I felt about Massachusetts and a lot of my family stayed there when I go home, I don't feel like, ah, Boston. That's right. My old home, it doesn't, I like Boston. I really love Boston. I love the people there. It doesn't feel like home. And in fact, New York never felt like home. I don't know where my home is. I am totally with you. I think there's a feeling of restlessness. I said to my family were kind of rough with each other, so they came to see the fan. It's loving, but they came to see the baby and they're just, they're just sort of a nightmare. It's a nightmare situation. I told the story on chemo, but my mom came in and it was like, the first thing she said was, uh, we got you a book for Leila.

Speaker 4:          23:40          We got her a book, but we left it in the diner in Pasadena. Will you go get it? And it was like fucking no. Yeah, no. That's not a gift. That's an errand we have a baby supposed to like out. So anyway, they're kind of nightmares. And I said to them, if there was show business in Hawaii, I'd be in Hawaii. But you know what I mean? I was like, if I could go further, but there's something that sounds cruel and I don't, I don't care. I could explain to you how we love each other.

Speaker 1:          24:04          No, no, I understand that you can, I want to go away. I understand that you can love your family and they can also drive you crazy. I think we can all sona you can, you can relate to that. Gourley I don't know what your situation is. Of course, of course. But I want you in this conversation. Thanks. You love your parents certainly and your family really dearly. But you also, uh, I mean you're routinely telling me how much you also despise all of them off Mike. Yeah, yeah. Off My, on a flow chart. He's constantly writing notes and pass them over to me during, I despise slash love my family and I'm like, you know what, I'm trying to work here. But you know, and my therapy

Speaker 4:          24:42          just hit me. He says, Hey, your parents will, which I think is what do you do it intelligently and do it graciously and lovingly. That and there is a way to sort of be like, yeah, I don't, I love you. That doesn't mean I like everything about you.

Speaker 1:          24:55          Tell my, my wife is a terrific, a terrific mom. She's great. She's always, yeah, she puts so much effort and thought and love and to into being a mom and I'll always remind her, remember they're going to go to therapy and they're going to complain about us. Yeah, we can do all, we can base this Turkey with love every five seconds, but the Turkey when it's finally done is going to go like, you know,

Speaker 4:          25:21          as a naive new parent and I'll concede that might be what I am. You're very early in the process. I'm very early.

Speaker 1:          25:27          How far along are you? How old? She's two and a half month. She's two and a half months. Right, because you brought her to the show seconds after she was born, which actually blew my mind. She was delivered in Jimmy Vivino has dressing. Yeah. You brought you, you came to the show and I was like, I can't believe you're doing a show cause you just, your wife just gave birth and you said you and you said, uh, what do you mean she's backstage and uh, I walked into the dressing room and your wife through the baby apnea. I catch and uh, it was, uh,

Speaker 4:          26:01          very scarring for everyone. But what we didn't know that when people say like don't do that, they mean that you're going to get your baby's sick. Yeah. Cause then we took our baby to Maui to see Ron does because I wanted her to, [inaudible] says my teacher, I guess we can say, uh, who's also from Boston, from Newton. Um, and I have a lot in common with him because of that, I feel. Anyway, I wanted him to her to meet him and she got a cold and we were like, oh, when people are like, you make all your mistakes with the first one. I was like, that's what they mean is we're on a plane, everyone's coughing. We get to the retreat. Everyone has like literally people have pneumonia and bronchitis and we were like, oh, we'll be in the room. Like we just, we fucked up. Then like one day she got too much sun on one side of her face, but something I noticed, I don't know if it was horrible parents, I'm really terrible parents. We need for the baby taken away. But it wasn't a sun burn. It was just like enough that it was like she would go with tubercular ward.

Speaker 5:          26:56          We thought she should see where tuberculosis is cure. So she was about a day old and we took her to show you lotus was, who knows, you make those mistakes with the first one you learn.

Speaker 4:          27:10          Bow felt horrible. I notice a naturally occurring in uh, in insurgence of what I call dad energy. Women can have that energy to obviously, and I can have mom energy, but I started having like that dad, like she'll be fine. And I meant it like she got more nervous than she normally did and I got more self assured that everything is going to be fine. And it was like, oh my God, we're getting each other's yangs right now and nobody asks for it. I didn't read any book about it. I guess exactly what you do. It's what happens. Right? If your wife was super chill, you freak out. That's right. If you know what, we're gonna have to take a break. We've talked about, we've talked to you. I've got to wrap up. We've been, how long has it been? It's been like a close to an hour. Jesus Christ tones. Letting you guys roll the fuck. I don't know much about this guy, but all I've seen him do is try to put this show in a box. You can't contain this. I'm lightening and he's the bottle. Yeah, we're getting and yanging. I'm father energy. He's a mother. Ah, I'm going to pay you a compliment. Oh, I will love it. Not right now. Several years. Several years from now. You're going to get a letter and it's going to happen.

Speaker 1:          28:19          Compliment. That's just going to say, uh, you, you drew tress. Well, it's going to be much less

Speaker 4:          28:25          own yet and you don't, and it's going to be in quotes. So you know, it's not true. You know what I like is that

Speaker 1:          28:32          you, um, there is a very popular vein in comedy, which is the comedian that is very unhappy and miserable and I've always liked that. You don't mind that vein. Do you know what I mean? That you, uh, and, and, and there's some other, Ron Funches also talks about things that make him happy. Yeah. But he talks about things that give him happiness. And I think you're a the same school, which I, I actually credit, I think that is a harder path to take. It's, um, it's a, it's a more original or fresh or path to take because I worry over the years of the people that, that come out and they just tell you over and over and over the world and how I'm sick, something's wrong with me. I'm bad, I'm nearby, you know, and, and I'm a disease and, uh, I dunno, I weary of that.

Speaker 4:          29:28          I appreciate that. When, when you're starting in the clubs, it's 90% 95 maybe just like, and I got up there, I punched him in the face, and then I realized

Speaker 5:          29:38          there was a woman and people were whoa.

Speaker 4:          29:42          And then you have to go up and be like, Kleenex. Hey, there used to be facial tissue, now it's clean. It, you know, like it's hard. But I'm so grateful that like the taste of comedy consumers shifted towards the positive and that started happening. You pioneered that in a huge way and made a space for people like me too, that want to be silly. They don't want to be like, and I said, bubble my partner, why am I doing it? Like a voice. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. It doesn't have to be against anybody. Well, I think there's it and I appreciate that. You know what's interesting to me is that

Speaker 1:          30:16          it's that I think there's a lot of people that conflate negativity with quote the truth. Yeah. So it's that whole school of if you're being negative, that's right. And you're saying dark things, you're telling the truth. That's right. And, uh, if you're not, if your comedy isn't right now railing against what's happening in our country and railing about, you know, who's president and what's, you know, happening, then you're escapist and you're not handling the truth. And I think, uh, I don't, I don't think I agree with that. Yeah. I don't think I agree with that. I think it's possible to be present in this world. Understand that not all is right with the world and then try to find a way

Speaker 4:          31:02          back at the dinner tip. Try to find the silliness, right? Yeah. There are people that confuse being sarcastic with having a personalities or hating everything is having a personality. This is a real epidemic you'll see in people's Twitter. Bio is it says like, sarcasm is just one of the many services I offer. It's secure in the way bath. You don't have to do those things. Oh, bless you. I hope we got that on her. That was a good one. We can solve that. We can get money for that. Yeah. You sneezing a lot lately. Use Nasal tracks. I just made up that chronic. Now we have to go find a company that and make them get that name. Is that fun? It's a podcast you can sing. Live it or not for was not true. No. Charles in charge of our days and our nights. It's like when your final shows of the tonight show, you can do what it the most expensive show ever.

Speaker 4:          31:52          Nobody's ever going to care. You didn't found out you couldn't pay for a song, so you saying the total charge that was, yeah, you could. If you could have sing any. You know what I did. It's also not true. You know what? It is not here. I it, I understand it is with yours, but it is not here and I'm not condoning that. I say do it crawl. You had me for a second thinking I could sing all of led Zepplin the most expensive catalog next to the Beatles. You think if we sing led Zeppelin, they're going to, they get a letter. No, but I think that the people in this corporation will have words. I say fan that fire. Go for it. I'll do it with you.

Speaker 6:          32:30          Maybe I'm not to back to school. I'll give me your

Speaker 4:          32:40          no, no, no, no, no, no man. Now I sing it so strange. Yeah. That melody is a vet, a Charles in charge of our days and our nights. Charles in charge of our wrongs and rights. Right? Cy Want Charles in charge of me. What a weird song. Why is he in charge of bronze our age? Well, terrible song. Anyway, there's no better way to get out on a podcast. Then me singing a song knit Earwolf isn't going to let come know what's going on. No one's going to come after us for the Charles in charge things I say, let them try. Yeah. Whoa. Gorley's throwing down. Yeah. I couldn't fire wall later in court. You just crying. No. Can I? This is a fun way to plug my, my standup special dirty clean, which is out on HBO now. There's a joke I couldn't do and it goes like this. First I go, do you ever get things that you're not attracted to children, which is kind of a funny line, and I go, but that shit is everywhere. Like what's going on with that song? Here's your little girl as you do.

Speaker 4:          34:03          Why am I hearing this at the dentist? It's like someone took a knife, baby edge and Dolan cut a six inch valley through the middle of my skull. Is that the next line? He had not a wake up with the sheets soaking wet head [inaudible] now we're just loving the song. That's a good song. It is a good one. Great Song. But all I said was like, that's fucking weird. Like nobody in the room recording booth like this through the glass when he was like, oh, go to bird desire. Yeah, it was like a Bruce. It's fucking weird, man. That's all I said. Don't do that Bruce. And I never called him a pet. A fee. I'm not an [inaudible]. We're not idiots. We're just saying the song sounds. Why did they cut that out? Because I'm there. The lawyers, not of HBO, because the Production Company would get sued.

Speaker 4:          34:45          Not Hbo. Hbo was fine with it. The production company wouldn't let me do it. And understandably because you're calling him a pedophile and then I'd say, Neil diamond girl, you'll be a woman's soon. Wait for that transition to be complete. Yeah, we're fucking ski. He's just 16 years old. Leave us alone. Yeah. As a lot of name, you're beautiful and your mind. There's a lot of 'em out there. I know. But those two were like kind of subtler. No, no, no, no. I, but I, I'm surprised that yanked, I'm surprised at that. Got Yanked. It was yanked, well, let's make some money. Make sure I get the name of the special correct. Jody, dirty, clean, dirty, clean. And that's out now. It's out now. That's how now and uh, on HBO go or Hbo now and watch the special, which is really funny. But then imagine that honk in it.

Speaker 4:          35:31          I know it's even a little bit better. I had another, speaking of it went out like that. I had a job where I go with sent, this didn't make this special. I got some songs sound unfinished. Dad's man has a barrow at the market place. Well, he has to say, okay, that's a good start. And then they get to the chorus. They're like, oh, blah, or blah. I just for now it goes on. Obviously I couldn't get for led Zeppelin and the Beatles in this episode. This is going to podcasts already. This is why I'm happy you're doing a podcast. It's, it's still showbiz, but like it's a dream. I don't know if you've ever had a dream of something that like requires almost no preparation or effort, but somehow impossibly produces a result. I would say sometimes better than something that we worked real. I have calculated every question and every response on this power hand and you've said all the things that I predicted you would say based on the algorithms I was working out long into the night, so I don't know what you're talking about. And I am old school and you've played right into my hands. Pete Holmes, an absolute desire.

Speaker 4:          36:37          I got a bad desire, bizarre terming out peaky. You're lying to me. He won't sit on the edge of mine. Neil, Pete, Pete, you put that thought in my head and I didn't think about it the rest of the day. Calling Bruce Springsteen cause we chat every day.

Speaker 5:          36:58          I'm sure not how he sounds a terrible Bruce impression. Oh Wow. Okay. Well that's what is that him as a deputy in uh, in an old cowboy west. You're coming calm down. Bad Bruce Springsteen. Impression of the bad guy. If you're coming over to you,

Speaker 4:          37:20          we gotta get him. You know, we also got to do something for the working man. Marshall Dillon. All right, I'm wrapping this thing up. This thing's gone on way too long. This isn't one of your nine hour bug, just free flow. A big believer. It's after the first hour that you get the good stuff. Who wants the good stuff? Went not for hoop, but after, and I say this, enter, he edits it. Don't edit this out. I have that control. So it's going ahead. Who told us that podcasts are supposed to be an hour. I had had the experience of being on a podcast and it's like our three. Nice. Do start to feel like, how does this stop bad where I'm the guest and uh, and I do think that they, if the studio was on fire, they wouldn't wrap it. I understand they're trying to get a little, a little more juice out of the Breezy's. That's Conan. So breezy. So that's your niche. That's right. Cause no one knows what you're talking about. Then I just say make it two hours. All right Sonia, you got to end this thing. Thank you for joining us. That was Pete Holmes, the heights dirty clean on HBO now and Crashing Back January 20th 20th after true detective after true detective where the sorbet after the heavy on my,

Speaker 5:          38:36          someone in a cro mask. I was going to shoot somebody and then I'll be like, why am I doing it? Right. I won't be doing that cause I'm with you. That's my girl in business. She, Mr Rob Roy, do you think you could put me on this show? CHOMP chomp on gum. Hands on hips. Scrunchy on wrist. Mr Robroy, why could be a singer? All right, this is ed piece out Tupac

Speaker 1:          39:14          and now it's time for another installment of Conan O'brien pays off the mortgage on his beach house.

Speaker 1:          39:26          Okay. Of course, I'm sitting here with producer Matt Gorley and some obsession is doodling something. Remember the time I caught you doodling at your desk sona and it was a button you weren't drawing everyone. You were drawing a, but remember this story, hold it. You remember when you were drawing a, but it's, I'm going to tell the story right now. There's no time who said, I know, but you said you don't do any work. I said, yes, I do. And I flipped through and I have my notebook and there was a drawing of a but yeah. And where were you drawing? Uh, but I uh, I didn't draw it. Jason Chalami, our fueled producer drew it on my notebook. He was just very embarrassing because I picked up sown as a book and see what works she'd been doing and it was just a drawing of a button is or notebook.

Speaker 1:          40:08          Well do you remember when we did those Roman ed Ed's and you were drawing erections all over the paper? It wasn't drawing them. I was sculpting. Oh, that's right. Um, Matt, we've now released a handful yeah. Of these podcast episodes and I thought we should do a state of the podcast where we assess how we're doing so far. Why don't you give us your assessment as a professional podcaster? Well, I don't think it's any surprise, but we're doing very well. This podcast as an average of five stars out of five stars. The download numbers exceeded expectations multiple times where they even upped the ad sales and then had to sell more at, so you're doing incredibly well. Okay. So that's good. I don't have any connection emotionally to any of that. I, those are just, that's you looking at various graphs and charts. You probably go into a dark room and uh, just look at all kinds of screens.

Speaker 1:          41:02          Yeah. My number's seller. Yeah. And, uh, I what I know. So I was in a foreign country called Canada and I was walking down the street and a car drove by and a guy road rolled down the window on his truck and said, God and I love the pod cast. Now that's something when you're reaching that just the streets of another country. I was in the streets of Vancouver. Now granted it's practically the United States. Yeah. Vancouver is pretty much a suburb of yeah. But I thought that was a good sign. I'm hearing more and more people say they liked the podcast and that's the only thing I go by is humans telling me. So your numbers and your graphs and your charts and your telling me mm, mm, mm. Yan retires areas quadruple their expectations.

Speaker 1:          41:57          Is that a fair, you think it's a good, first of all, I didn't use that voice. And second of all, I am a person telling you that. Oh, you're right. How do you feel about it? Are you feeling good? I am. I enjoy it. Yeah. I totally go by how things feel. I'm essential, man. I'm a centralist too. I feel like I know it. So now it goes through on a day to day and uh, I go a totally on, I'm very tactile, so the hell, I'm like Jeff Goldblum I have to touch everything around me. Oh, oh, oh, that's Jeff. Jeff Goldblum. I, um, I, it feels good to me. Yeah. I enjoy it. It feels like a form that fits my, a rambling mine. Uh, so now what are you doing? Why are you, you're on your phone when I need help over here. I know what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          42:42          Can I just say something first of all, when we're doing the podcast for doing the podcast? No. And I looked over him. Your paper please. And you were drawing furiously and you're drawing. Who is that? It's looks like kind of a chubby girl. That's very good. Little Chubby boy. Oh, it's a little chubby little Afro. Okay. And then you're drawing, you drew all these weird designs on the side, right? So you're scratching and scribbling and then I see you texting on your phone and you're like the teenage daughter. I'm trying to explain to you. We're at, we're in Washington DC and I'm showing you the Lincoln memorial and explaining to you who Abraham Lincoln is and you're on your phone. You know, sexting with your finger gets, yeah, put that down. Put it down. The state of the podcast is that the show's doing well, but behind the scenes it's a mess here.

Speaker 1:          43:24          You doodle constantly. Why can't I doodle a little bit? I drew a little guy. Yeah, but you're not in the moment. I'm always present it in the moment you have an attention problem. You know what I do. But you know in my defense I'm answering emails for you cause I am your assistant. So I'm an I do this. I shut my phone off on my phone. Doesn't exist because I'm only doing this all. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do a doodle off. Okay. I'm going to tell you something to draw and both of you are going to give it your best shot. Go. Okay. A puppy dog with a Christmas bow on it.

Speaker 7:          43:58          Thank God this. Cause I dropped puppy dogs all the time. All right. Yeah. Go ahead and talk us through your process as well. I'm imagining the puppy dog, they both have a very interesting, like sodas just blazing this. Yeah. Well, she draws puppy dogs all day long. That's what I do. They're both actually quite good. All she does is draw your doctors like Conan is like the New Yorker style artwork. James Thurber, and he's got a bow in his head. It's a Christmas pepe.

Speaker 1:          44:26          One done. Whoa. All right, let's take a please sign it. Please sign it. Okay. Quite a signature

Speaker 4:          44:32          to wow. Yeah. I drew, I, I was under the, we were drawing as quickly as possible, so no one said that. Who said that? No one did. But I, I just, when I heard competition, I just immediately started going really fast and so on it please put your name at the top. So I'm going to put, I'm going to put an extra piece of flair on this guy,

Speaker 7:          44:53          both of these and precedent. Does yours have a bow on it as, yeah. He said a bow as oh, it is. Okay. Right. Yeah. Wow. Okay. So here's what we'll do. Uh, go to earwolf.com to the page for this episode and you can see the pictures of these drawings and do you can vote amongst yourselves or on Reddit or wherever you want with friends, whether Sona did the best dog with a bone and drawing and the little Christmas pop and then keeping her name at the top two as the assignment is clearly.

Speaker 4:          45:27          No, no. Okay. You're taking a lot from Conan. This is great for people listening on the aisle. And now what can I say something girly. Oh, you're the first podcast producer to have people silently draw on the air. Probably your downfall. You know, I didn't know what eventually. What's that? You? Uh, come on. Wow, that's not fair. Mine's funny. Look at the dog is sad. Should I? Okay. The dog is sad looking at a Christmas tree with a thought bubble that says, I'm too wish. It's funny, the owners didn't know his religion. Yeah, they just assumed. Yeah. So anyway, well you withdrew in sharpie. You have a tree, you have a like a border. Oh God. You know what? You and your generation. All you do is cast blame. It's beer, it's beer. Where is my reality show? Where's my billion dollars? I put the work in and I reaped the rewards. I don't know. You're the one who started a show cause you didn't get enough love in it. Well it's working.
