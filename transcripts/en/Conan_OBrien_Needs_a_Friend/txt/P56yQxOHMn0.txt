Speaker 2:          00:00:55       Hi,

Speaker 3:          00:00:56       my name is Dax Shepard and I feel very optimistic about being Conan O'Brien's friend

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       on the fence.

Speaker 1:          00:01:27       Hey there, welcome to Conan O'brien needs a friend to show her. I come to Brian, speak to celebrities, interesting personalities on the hopes of finding myself, possibly a friend and I'm talking one that isn't on my payroll so it doesn't work for me. A real pal. I'm aided in my quest by my trusty assistant Sonoma of session. Hi. And my producer Matt Gorley. Hi at today's guest is someone, someone I have

Speaker 3:          00:01:58       a bone to pick with. We'll talk about that later. Uh, I do love the Guy Dax Shepard. I know we've had some stutters steps, but I'm not giving up on this.

Speaker 3:          00:02:14       You think it's possible? Absolutely. There is a little bit of, uh, an incident that happened between us that we won't get into right now. We're going to save that just a little bit, which I think caused us, uh, to uh, fail a minute fire. It was a misfire in our attempts to get together and become real friends. And I mean you a Christian and myself and my wife lives a really getting together as a foursome. Yes. A double day. Proper Double Day. I proper double date adults. Babysitters. You have a whole nine valet parking. Yeah. Then into the farmer's daughter Motel on Fairfax. Exactly. And then we switch it up. We just pop on something exciting. We'll see what happens. No expectations. It's a little Ang Lee ice party scene where there's only four of us and uh, we put keys in and so it's, if we don't pick our own spouses, nothing exciting has happened.

Speaker 3:          00:03:06       Right. I mean, if we do pick our own spices, but spouses the best we fell apart there will listen. The best part about that scenario is you and I would be on the are, you know, respect of beds at the farmer's daughter hotel and we would be so excited about the possibilities in our wives would be so bummed. Yeah, it's true. It's true. They both would be praying that we got our own car keys in that scenario. Yeah. Isn't that awesome? That's exactly what would happen. It's exactly what, what happened, uh, has a lot about us. You and I, I think it does. I think a women cringe, uh, when we look at them. But that's not true. You're your real man's man. I'm going to say this about you. Oh, okay. You're a man's man. And I say this because I visited a your house not long ago when we recorded your podcast where you had an incredibly comfortable chair and I did not.

Speaker 3:          00:04:01       But I guess that's your thing. Well you had a couch. It wasn't that uncomfortable. It wasn't great. I didn't have you on a, you know what it was? I'm pretty sure there's a foldout iron bed in that it's, it's one of those kind of an iron maiden. Yeah, there's a stick. It was not a comfortable plush couch. I didn't feel that way. Well I, first of all, I apologize and you though, he's, your chair was your chair is a lazy boy. It's incredible. It's incredible. Chair. I gave it up one time on one episode because if you interviewed David Harbour, I have not. Do you know who he is from stranger things? He's the cop. Yeah. He arrived and I was like, this guy's a fucking grizzly bear. Look at this man. He was just such a man then I felt it would have been inappropriate to not give him that lazy boy chair.

Speaker 3:          00:04:51       That's interesting cause I came in and said this is an equal, I'll, I'll put him on the couch and I'll keep the proposal. That was a good safe. I will say that you are, you were the manlier of men because I come to your house and I see first of all this like all terrain vehicle parked on in your compound on a trailer, on a trailer. But it is one of those things that looks like in the, it's a mad max post apocalyptic vehicle. It's an la of actuation evacuation crisis vehicle. Like when the 7.0 hits. Yeah. My family and I will be in that. It's a Polaris razor four seater turbo. That's what I thought it was. I saw it and it's like that's a Polaris razor four seater. I knew you were thinking that and I appreciated that you didn't try to embarrass me.

Speaker 3:          00:05:42       I think you knew what it was and you were afraid. He might not know what even owns, so I'm not even gonna bring it up. Yeah. Respected that. Yeah. There's this great documentary. I especially think you as the owner of a boy should watch. He was, uh, quite, uh, I purchased a boy. That's correct. Well, you made you have a daughter and I have a son. I think that's what you're trying to say. Yes. You have a daughter and his son and there is a documentary called the mask you live in. Have you heard of this? No. Oh my God. I have to bring it up because you're talking about masculinity and it is all about how we culturally, um, lay the foundation of what a boy or a man supposed to be and pretty much how cancer as it is for all of us.

Speaker 3:          00:06:26       And they've kind of lay out four criteria. And as we were learning the criteria, I was with Monica and my wife and it became abundantly clear what a cliche I am. It was like sexual conquests. That's, that defines manhood. Um, fighting. I'm consuming copious amounts of booze or alcohol or drugs. And then money got to make money to be a man. And I was like, oh, that's been driving me since eight years old. Those four things all day, every day. I am one on a four. That's crazy. No. Yeah, I don't, uh, I heard you can suck down a eighth of an ounce of kind kush weed in was single toe. That's what I've been told about you. Uh, glad that that's out there about and not true. I, it's an, it is not true. I never, uh, I never dabbled much. Never really dabbled at all in drugs.

Speaker 3:          00:07:21       I will say. And uh, the Times I've tried sweet Mary Jane, I think you guys call it. Oh yeah, that's what we're calling it. A or wacky cigarettes. Uh, the time it was my uncle that told you you would really benefit was the one who Robert Smuggle it was my memory or no? Uh, no, it was pretty recent. That, okay. So the fact that you're bragging about myths meant, it makes me question your memory to the fact that the fact that you're like, Huh, I remember. I so Brian, right? Brian. Right. Pretty good. Huh? I shocked myself. That's why. Yeah. Yeah. Robert's Michael, a brilliant writer and uh, insult the comic. Yeah. Trying to insult comic dog and Blah, blah, blah. And I've known him forever. And when we were at Santa and life together, he said, you're the only guy I know who would benefit from smoking because it would, it would calm you down.

Speaker 3:          00:08:10       You're so tightly coiled that it, when, if you smoked, the cancer that you would get would still be offset by the relaxation of the cigarette. Yeah. Yeah. But, but you know, you talk about masculinity. I think I've done a pretty good job with my son in setting. I think in a lot of ways, a low bar he gets to make, he makes fun of me constantly. And, and, uh, I'm very self deprecating around him. I'm not a big sports guy. I'm not an incredible athlete. I work out a lot, but I'm not a great athlete. And so I have not set that expectation. I'm trying very hard about the stuff. Like, um, don't cry. Oh, I've never told him not to cry. Okay. And what about wished privately? Sometimes he would stop, you know, uh, you know, there've been times, there were times when, uh, you know, when, when he would lose it a over something that I thought was kind of small and I think like, Gee, you know, you're, you know, my son is in his late thirties and you know what, it'd be like, okay, you dropped your donut, but you shouldn't cry.

Speaker 3:          00:09:13       No, no, my son, uh, no, he doesn't. I've never done that. I've never shamed him for in any way. I don't think. Well, how about this? It starts with a very simple observation, which I was definitely true where I grew up, which is we almost defined boys in opposition to girls. And so the worst thing you can be as a boy is to be a girl, is to be feminine. And in order of insults on a playground, it is basically your sissy, your a girl. Right? And it, and it's, so the only thing topping the female thing is then the homophobia. So it's like, so it's tricky is when you're, when you're introducing this concept that to be a girl is bad and it's not boy like you inadvertently are, are basically establishing a hierarchy of one's better than the other if you, if you're supposed to avoid that.

Speaker 3:          00:10:03       So, and then we get in these very insular clubs cause it's very hard for us to emote and to talk about our feelings because we're told not to do that. And then we get old enough where we start drinking and now we'd say I love you and that's why we drink. So we can tell everybody we love him. And now we're in this little pod and we've been told our whole lives that being a a woman or a girl is bad. So then weirdly we feel superior to them. I think it's all tricky. And I, I found myself going like, oh yeah, I got that software downloaded into me big time. But you, it sounds like you are a, you are unpacking it. I'm trying, but some of it is. So I find this when I'm working on a car and I hit my hand and I really draw blood, like it's more, I'm already frustrated.

Speaker 3:          00:10:46       And then the wrench slips. And then I cut my hand, my f, and I'm ashamed to admit this, but the first word out of my mouth is a homophobic pejorative because it's like in my reptilian brain, like on the playground, that was the worst thing you could be called. And you were trying at all times and not be called that. And so it's just, it's, it's cemented in there and I can't get it out, you know, I know enough not to do that in real life, but like in a moment where I'm, I got really badly hurt and I'm already frustrated that we're, that word comes out and it's cuckoo. I, cause I'm not homophobic, I'm trying to relate to you. Uh, but I don't work on cars. And the closest I can get to is if I'm watching a PBS documentary on Emily Dickinson. Great, great.

Speaker 3:          00:11:34       Uh, and, and they leave out the part where she was in love with her gardener out the window. Exactly. And they skip that part and they say they're going to get to it later. I usually shout out some kind of a slur. Yeah, it'd be it racial homophobic. Right. And I worry that my son will see that and feel that I'm less of a man while I'm watching the Emily Dickinson. Yes. But it's very hard. You do have that software. I don't think I have that software. You don't? I don't think I have. How could you have grown up in Massachusetts or however you guys say it? That's exactly how we say it. You know that as a exceedingly tall, redheaded kid and not have been called names. You are all those names. No, no. I was called names. I, uh, I, you know, got into, uh, you know, scrapes every now and then.

Speaker 3:          00:12:25       Uh, I was, uh, I had my nose broken once that very badly, and the north end of Boston. Uh, what age? I was 18. And I was, uh, a salted by a group. I believe they were a young Italian men who didn't think, uh, an Irish guy should be in there. I swear to God. And so ironically, right? It's like an 18th centuries wobble. Yeah. It really was like, look, and I had Ushman has come into the Italian section. What is this? Is this 1820 well, the saddest socio dynamic, if we're going to use words like that. I'm not, that's not even a word. I just kind of, you're a strong guy and you've, you've had a lot of experience fighting. Yes. Okay. How confident are you that, like right now if I whipped this podcast, headset off and came across the room and started swinging, that you'd be able to handle me?

Speaker 3:          00:13:18       I've lived, I feel good about it. Yeah. Yeah. What would my do you think I would be a worthy opponent or, and just be honest, I don't strike you as a goal. I'll be honest. I'll tell you some things. Yeah. You're, you're strong. I know you exercise a lot. Yeah. I think you're strong. You're bigger than me. I think you outweigh me probably by 30 pounds or so of debts. Muscle weight. Yeah. You're thin. You're whatever you have is muscle muscle. Well, not all of it. Did you wrestle with your brothers a lot growing up? Uh, not effectively. I was quickly overwhelmed by my oldest brother Neil, who was much, much bigger than all of us and we'll just sit on me and then laugh as I was underneath him. Right. Okay. Well you know, much like, um, uh, Tarzan grew up around apes and he could break it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:06       He could swing from trees like yeah. Yeah. So my brother was five years older than me and he fought me every hour of every day and I think that made me a very good wrestler. Yeah. Cause I was fighting someone much bigger than me, older than me. So I feel like my wrestling skills are really on point. I fought my mother physically. Okay. Uh, which didn't go well. She also bashed me. Okay. So then I went after my grandmother who lived in the House with us. She also gets her, she also one which did she employs, she was in her, she was in her nineties. Okay. All right. All right. She know she used just brute strength. So I think your price, he also had a mouth, like a sailor too, right? She had got a psychological, don't get me started on that one. You know, my lived in the house with us when we were growing up and she had grown up.

Speaker 3:          00:14:55       She's, uh, had lived a very long time and she had grown up in Massachusetts during the early 20th century. I mean, I think she was like 22 years old when the titanic sank. Oh, real. And show she on Saint Patrick's Day, she pulled me aside and she told me, now you're going to go to school today and all the Protestant kids who are going to tease you. And I was like, this is 1975. And you know, I'm, I'm going to this racially mixed public school where, you know, kids have Afros, there's Korean kids. There's mean. It's just,

Speaker 4:          00:15:32       no one's thinking about that. And she said,

Speaker 3:          00:15:36       go to school today and the Protestant kids are going to laugh. He, and I'm the laugh at you. I'll never forget that. She said, and they're going to try and, uh, they're going to try and rile you. And she said they're going to put chocolate in your milk.

Speaker 4:          00:15:48       I thought like, oh my God, that's something that happened to her in 1902 some protestants put a piece of chalk and her milk and got the best of muddy Reardon, you know, and, and I was like, what? And then of course I went in a bowl thermal and your oil lamp and when you light a smoke up the loud, yeah, it's changed your whale oil for seal oil and the light will be dimmer than you expect. So she, um, and then I got to school and like, people are wearing dashikis and you know, but anyway, the point sheet,

Speaker 3:          00:16:30       uh, it didn't happen. It didn't happen to you. It didn't happen. It was not mocked for being Irish. I was mocked for being a, I got hand me down clothes early in my life and my pee, my pants never fit cause my legs grew so fast. So I was constantly tormented. Where's the flood? Okay, where's the flood? Right? Where's the flood? And for awhile I didn't understand it. And then they said, [inaudible] someone had to explain if there were a flood, you would raise your pants. And I was like, oh, okay. Just put chalk in my milk then. Right, right. Let's just cut to the chase. Put the chalk in my mouth, but it makes me think, did you read the first tycoon, the Cornelius Vanderbilt? I've read, I've skipped through it and read pieces of it, but I love it. I love it. I've read all those, uh, where the parishioner, what'd he say?

Speaker 3:          00:17:16       Uh, the class, those token the best, yes. The rigging that golden age. Yeah. They called parishioner clients. I don't know at any rate of all those guys. Uh, Carnegie, uh, you know, uh, Rockefeller, Rockefeller, the most fascinating is Cornelius Vanderbilt because he was just a tough son of a bitch. And, um, he got, grew up just, I think he had like one row boat when he CRD. He did. Yeah. He let on a little island. It was all Dutch people and uh, he grew it into this steam ship empire. But, um, the, the, the most famous fighter of the day, some Irish men who was like the champion of New York, uh, said some stuff about him in the paper and then they were having the Saint Patrick's Day parade and Cornelius was on horseback and the, that fighter came out into the street and he was pretty drunk and Cornelius got off of his horse and punched out the heavyweight champion.

Speaker 3:          00:18:11       And it's documented in the paper. It's not like lore and uh, yeah. Now that's the kind of tycoon I want to read about. Exactly. You don't see bill gates knocking anyone. I'm not going to have Mike Tyson Saint Patty's day. Exactly. If a, if, if you know, Mark Zuckerberg took out, you said, what about my Gregor Macgregor? You said, what about Facebook? How do I know? Right? I'm Saudi. Saudi. No, come here. I'm going to rip your ass publicly. What's the rent? Take a break. We're going to take a break. Is that we take as a race on here. We'd take breaks on this one. Cause you know what? Okay, good. Let's make some money. I have these cash cows. Oh yeah, yeah. They are. Yeah. To talk about that. Yeah. We've been told it's a cash cow. Just while you're sitting here, put a ton of my own money into this and I'm not seeing anything, man. All right, we'll take a break. Hold on.

Speaker 5:          00:19:03       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       and now for this segment, Conan O'brien pays off the mortgage on his beach house. Yeah. I hate to bore people with my financial problems, but um, as you know, I got a beach house but on a nice beach and then took out a really big mortgage and then took a loan on that mortgage almost immediately then took a loan on that loan. So, so many bad decisions. Yes, I counted, uh, it's three bad decisions in a very quick succession. I'm okay. Uh, everyone's fine and kids are going to eat and there's a roof over her head and everything, but, um, I need to get to work. You need to make some money and we must do that. Now,

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       Sony, you're aware of how much I love to read. You read constantly and you kind of make fun of, you know, the fact that I read a lot, I always have like a giant book under my arm. Call it nerd. Okay. It's a good way to mock someone for trying to broaden their horizons. I do, I do. I love books. I love reading. Uh, living in Los Angeles soon your car a lot. And for a long time I tried reading while I was driving and uh, just I was wreaking havoc just crashing into things and that I don't recommend that. Do not read novels and erotic thrillers while you're driving, but it's one of the reasons that I truly do love audible. I am a user of audible. I, I like audible because I love listening to books while I'm driving. Let's honest. You don't love reading to you.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       I find it tedious. Um, would you listen to an audible book if I was narrating it? Uh, why you listen to your voice all the time? What if you were listening to, um, like 50 shades of gray and I was narrating it. That would be, would it be like your nightmare? That would be my absolute nightmare. And it was so worse thing I could ever subject myself to. Okay, I don't see how any of this has anything to do with audible. And I blame you. And if you play back the tape, you'll see that it was you who brought up 50 shades anyway. Yes, that's true. You do not love to read, but you like to hear a book. I do. I like information. Yeah. Well, what's cool about audible is you can get just an incredible selection of audio books, bestsellers, mysteries, thrillers, memoirs.

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       You can choose three titles every month. You can listen on any device, anytime, anywhere. You can listen at home. You can listen at the gym was says at the gym. I don't know how that works. I don't know if I could listen to a really intense book. Um, while I was at the gym. Well, you don't read light fare. You read like, you know, war and yeah, I don't think I could read a detailed account or listen to a detailed account of the fall or are they the fight for Stalin Grad? Say, um, wow. Uh, I was doing a bench press or jazzercise or sizing jazzers sizing. That's my thing. No, anywhere you are, you can listen to a audible check it out. And uh, they've got a great audio book library. Get to keep that forever. So I'm, I'm a believer inaudible. I actually do listen to great stuff while I'm driving.

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       So for a limited time, you can get three months of audible for just 695 a month, six 95 a month. That's very reasonable. That's more than half off the regular price of give yourself a gift. Cause guess what? It's that time of year, the time of year when we think of ourselves and give ourselves a gift. That's the true meaning of the holidays. Give yourself the gift of listening. And while you're at it, think about giving the gift of audible to a loved one. A friend, someone on that list from more go to audible.com/conan O'Brien or text Conan O'brien to 500 500.

Speaker 6:          00:23:23       And that leads me to this thought that just popped into my head. Everybody. Every business wants to know what their customers are thinking, what they care about. And a, if you've got a business you want to meet my friends at campaign monitor, I'll let me explain as best as I can. Campaign monitor is an email marketing platform. It makes it easy to send emails your customers care about.

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       I usually know I'm not tech savvy. Right? What's an email? Okay, so we're starting at the basics. Yes. You're saying, okay, so email is electronic mail. You get on your computer. Okay. I don't have a company so I don't know. These are will you? I don't think you're going to have a company. What does that mean? Why wouldn't I have a company? I could have a company, I don't know. You're way too laid back. I am laid back here. Yeah. You're not starting a company, but if I did have a company, I would use campaign monitor.

Speaker 6:          00:24:15       Yeah. Well, campaign monitor. I'm, I'm, again, this is what I'm told. It's got helpful tools. They have a drag and drop email builder and they have a library of ready to go templates. So you can create a personal relational email and automations and you can build relationships with your customers leading to more engagement and revenue for your brand. I have a lot of questions and if you have questions, they have a friendly support system of people who are available seven days a week. So I might just call them and say, I just did an ad for you guys and I'd like you to explain to me what this is and you can sign up for and try out their platform for free. No cards, no contract. So maybe the best way to find out what this is is to just sign up and start using it.

Speaker 4:          00:25:05       Well, you know, if when I opened my company and I start my company and I want to send out emails to my customers to market the products that I will eventually have, this is the kind of platform I will use in order to do that. So I a company would you have, you'd have, it'd be something real chill like beanbag chairs. I sit that would be a cool company. I'd have a really cool company. I'd be really, do I think you're a cool person? You know that right? I could start a company. It takes, um, what's it called? Work to start a company. It also takes a great email marketing platform and so I would use campaign monitor, which are very successful company. Whatever that is. Go ahead. You know, the best thing to do is check it out. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:25:48       For yourself and go to campaign monitor.com/conan. Okay. Campaign monitor.com/conan campaign monitor or make your emails unforgettable. That's um, a slogan. I just thought of. Rebecca, can you

Speaker 3:          00:26:09       hear with Dax Shepard? You really do think we could be friends? Oh, absolutely. You know, I really do. I know that this is like kind of a comedic premise. I recognize that it's a bit of a comedic premise, but it has some grain of truth in it. Yeah. I would like to discuss the real of it. Yeah. If you're open to it, I am. Maybe you'll have to save this to episode 100 where you have a breakthrough or something. Yeah. But in your mind, when you think about the fact that you haven't accumulated a bunch of friends in show business, my assumption is you think their fault. Is that accurate? Nothing is my fault. Well, I mean it's very human to assume it's the other person doesn't want to be friends with you. Yeah. Is that your assumption? I mean, sincere, uh, if we're gonna do this sincere thing, I have to change my tone of voice.

Speaker 3:          00:26:58       Maybe a different shirt to get a whole wardrobe they ran in for sincere wardrobe right now, something, uh, I need something made of hemp. Um, yeah, I would say it's a, mostly, I would say it's mostly comedic premise and then there's a grain of truth, but it more, it comes out. I actually do not blame other people. I don't, I don't, uh, if we're going to be sincere, I don't blame other people. I, I know that I have, I spoke with your wife about this. I'm really busy and I have a a wife and two kids and I'm really involved with them. I had come from a big family and I do have a set of friends and it's very hard to get together with them. It's really hard to make it happen. You and I also live on opposite sides of this city, which shouldn't be a big deal, but it actually is a gigantic deal.

Speaker 3:          00:27:55       If you're listening and you don't know about Los Angeles, uh, you, it takes 90 minutes for me to get to Conan's house at the wrong time of day and it's only 19 miles and that's in a Leer jet. I mean you have, you have post apocalyptic cars that can drive over other cars. I've thought about just going straight over the Santa Monica mountains to your house in the off road vehicle and I'm not ruling that out. You do it. Well, if that fucking p 21 cougar could get himself from there over to Griffith Park, I assume. I must be able to. Yeah, you can do it in your vehicles needs a mobile ramps and stuff. Oh, that's a problem. There's a couple interesting things to explore, which is, one is that just might be you, right? You might not be ultra social and you might be very satisfied being with your family and using all the time you're not at work for your family and then that would be fine, but even if you were fine with it, you'd have to relieve yourself of this expectation that people should have a ton of friends.

Speaker 3:          00:28:55       Like you couldn't just peacefully go, Oh, you know what? I'm just not that kind of person because you inherently are innately just kind of feel like, well, what's wrong with me? Why don't I desire that? But I wonder for you is do you desire it or do you just not desire it? I think two things. I think one a, and this is very hard for people to believe, but it's true of a lot of people to get into comedy. A lot of people get into comedy or there's a strain of person that gets into comedy. And I think I fall into this category where there's a bit of a shyness and people don't believe that I'm shy because I'm very verbal. I really do like people, I like to talk to them, but I am the kind of person who, if I'm at home and I'm on the second floor and the doorbell rings, I'm really hoping my wife gets it because I'm, I need a little more, like I need to ramp up to going down and saying hi to someone.

Speaker 3:          00:29:49       And, and I don't think anyone listening to this would believe that that's true. But I do get a little shy. And also when I'm, when I'm in a restaurant and I see other celebrities or people I've interviewed, I'm, I got to work up the nerve to a little bit to go over there and say hi to them. Right. Because it's not my natural. I always think people want to be left alone. I, they don't, I don't want to bother them. You know, this is very Boston, have you, but um, what's kind of fascinating is, um, I two I didn't have social anxiety my whole life. I'm very, I was very social. I love going to bars and stuff. Um, being famous, uh, resulted in me having social anxiety weirdly enough because when I would meet strangers I would feel, and again I'm putting this all on myself, they probably be just happy to shake my hand that be that.

Speaker 3:          00:30:44       But I feel this obligation to deliver something to them when I meet them. I feel like from the second we start talking, it's on my shoulders to make this a memorable, interesting exchange. And quite often if we're at a public place with a bunch of people, I don't, I can't do that 45 times in one night. And I start just thinking, oh, that person left let down. Like, oh, that guy isn't nearly as fun or gregarious as he presents himself and Conan's talk show. So I feel like I have as a result of, of being, you know what I mean? Like that word. But yes, but being famous has, has, eh, definitely increased my level of, of social anxiety. That's interesting. I don't, you know, you had it on the same level before. Yeah, I think I had a little bit of that. I definitely had that shyness before.

Speaker 3:          00:31:33       Um, I do think to contrast myself with you, uh, I, I do feel like people might expect me to entertain them a little bit and I do it for everybody. Sure. I'm failing and Sonia, you can weigh in on this, but if the guy comes to change the smoke alarm in the house because you know, uh, I want that person to have a satisfactory entertaining moment with Conan O'brien and, and uh, if I'm at a party for the 150 people and uh, and at some function where I'm supposed to talk to, uh, you know, I'm supposed to mingle and talk to them at some function for the network, I will get to everybody and I will give them my full, it's been just fine. The platinum package, I, everybody gets it. Everybody gets it. And it's not a status thing. I do it. I am running for something, I'm running for some high office and I don't even know what it's for.

Speaker 3:          00:32:37       Well, I know for me it is, and this is something that I've had to like really work at is um, the notion that someone would walk away and not like me is so painful. My own ego of like someone, like someone's going to walk away and go, oh, he's an asshole in real life. I find that to be, you know, painful. The thought of. Yes. But through having kids, it has helped move me a little bit closer to a healthy place, which is I am generally quite nice if you meet me out in the rest of are a nice guy. If I'm with my kids, I'm not very nice because it's their time. It's no one else's time. So before at the airport and people want to take pictures and stuff with us, I, I'm, I'm not mean, but I'm very direct in that this is their time.

Speaker 3:          00:33:23       Yup. And I have had to become comfortable with the notion that, Yup, some people on planet earth are going to leave you and say that guy's a Dick and tell people that I'll never meet that I'm a dick and I just have to get comfortable with that because my priority is these two little girls and I got to live with that and you can't control that. And also you can give them everything they want, but if it's a better story later on in a cocktail party that you're a dick. Yes. Then you're a dick. And so and so you just talk to the person for 15 minutes to try and convince them that you're a good guy, good person. And then you bought them. I'm going to try all airport, uh, you know, and carried their bags, gift shop and carry their bags. But then they're like, yeah, I met him.

Speaker 3:          00:34:05       I Dunno. It seems like kind of a Dick. And that's their story for the rest of their life because frankly on her store, it's a more fun story. Um, let's get to this because really quick, I just love when you were on my show. He corrected my English like six or seven times and I just said funner. And as it was coming out of my mouth, I go, he's not going to roll with that and just match my, or he's going to say more fun, which is correct. I don't did, I don't have, isn't it crazy how lightening fast these thoughts happen? Well, from her and in the moment those two syllables came out of my mouth, I felt insecure. I thought about what you were going to do a, all this stuff happened. That's where it, cause I just instantly felt pity for you. Same Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:34:48       Let's get to this. We just got to get it out of the way. Oh, okay. Uh, I made an attempt, a good hearted attempt. I came out of my shell, I reached out to and I said, let's, uh, after he would suggested it, let's really make this double date happen, but oh, that's insufficient. Hold on. That's not sufficient. Hold on. Okay, go ahead. You, uh, I, I put out there, uh, how about three, four, no, none. And I'm not letting you proceed. Your, your, your, your timeline. You've jumped way too far ahead. Okay. So here's what's, here's what really happened, which is I've been on your show 350 times. Yeah. We get along great on your show. We have a great chemistry. Yes. Some of my finest chemistry is shared with you and my wife. That is a very specific rapport we have. Yes. And I ran into you in Santa Barbara at a party and we started talking.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       Yeah. And there I discovered you love history and I love history. So we started really talking about history. It was whole bunch. It was fun to our wives. Total erotic fantasy come true. Yeah. Um, they weren't, they weren't touching themselves as, as we were discussing grants. Second term. Yes. So in that moment, uh, also that you ride bicycles, you ride motorcycles, so that now we discovered, oh, we could be real life friends. Right. I just, I think that's relevant. It's not like on the 29th appearance on your talk show. You were like, Hey, let's hang. No, and we talked about maybe getting together and we tried to make it happen a few times and then I just get her to do a real three dimensional human being that I would be interested in hanging out with. But those, is that a surprise to you? Absolutely. I meet you on a talk show. Yeah. Yeah. You have a persona during the talk show. Is it that different from who I am and really you do a different voice like I don't know, every two minutes now if you imagine, I mean someone over for dinner who's going to do a different voice every two minutes? Let me in. I can entertain you.

Speaker 3:          00:36:49       I'm one it those mashed potatoes I lesson. That was my catch phrase for 94 those mashed potatoes. That was my catch phrase in 94 slash 95 one of those mashed potatoes. It was a big thing. Then look it up. It was just as that was during friends for a season. Here we go. I put out how about three 14 three 15 or three 24 you right back. You're really excited. And you say three 15 I love that you're saying your exact sentences, but paraphrasing mind. I don't feel like this is just at all cause I have the same, I have the same shit on my phone that I also brought. Okay. Listen, I'm half of this print it out on pieces of paper, which makes me better. Okay. The, so we established that the date would be three 15 now you're a history buff. March 15th the ides of March.

Speaker 3:          00:37:34       Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What happened on the Julius Caesar was stabbed by Marc Antony. Um, right. It was a Brutus Brutus stabbed him. Brutus. Yeah. Brutus Stamp Mark Antony. I don't take Mark Anthony. Like how I'm saying Antony. Antony was his only friend, right? Yeah. Well but Brutus was a friend. March 15th is a famous state that when it goes sideways, when not just that when a man is betrayed by someone he thought was his friend. Yeah. Okay. The ides of March. Okay, great. So you write me back and here's, you better read this shit verbatim because I have it. I have it right here. I actually was delighted. So again, I'm going to interject because I'm the fucking did this. Then I let you talk more when you were on my show. So let me talk for one second. Oh, here we go. Hold up. Let a sense stones here though. You're pissed. Order order. So your pistol quiet. Clearly. I've got him on the road. Okay, go says I'm doing voices all the time. A teen, true. Like Tatiana, attain TrueCar. I'm secure. I don't need to entertain constantly.

Speaker 3:          00:38:39       You say perfect. I'll start fasting now. Three 15 march 15 exclamation point. Okay. Your friend is telling you to flip the page. Uh, that's not my friend. This is like watching your 90 year old grandma kick your ass. It's laborious. Then I reached out to you on the 15th and say, Hey, is this happening? You get back to me and the only reason I bring this up here as well, or I insist you now go verbatim, which I'm now holding the same script as you. Okay, go ahead. Okay, let me do my part. You read new because by the way, when I looked this up to find out who was right or who was wrong, and you'll soon learn I was wrong. I can admit that that's all I wanted. I was upset to see that I was wrong. But then it was delighted by our exchange because it really delivered.

Speaker 3:          00:39:22       You're very funny in your exchange. And I say one thing just before him. The only reason I bring this up and being so such a stickler, is it an I did your podcast and I said you canceled day up and you insisted that it was impossible that you would cancel day of. So I went back into the files as did I. And when I realized that you cancel day of I dance, I orgasm for the first time in four years, mostly done mixing. Most mostly dust came out some lint. Yeah, Lynn and a a a Lincoln Penny. So my friend Conan inquires, whether or not we're on for that night. And here's my response. So when we made these plans and I picked this date, I knew I was shooting a Sitcom, but at the time they told me we would shoot live on Fridays in front of an audience.

Speaker 3:          00:40:13       Then I got the schedule last night and learned I will be shooting stuff tonight as well. For some weird reason I'm attaching it I guess because it's very important to me that you know, I'm not lying, which in and of itself probably d'oeuvre deserves some exploration. At any rate, I'm very bummed that this is the case and I hope we can reschedule. Don't give up on me. Dad. Interesting. You made me your father. Uh Huh. That's right. And I did attach the, the, the, the schedule. Would you by the way, literally did come up the night before. So yes, I couldn't have really done a better job because I just found out basically when you found out, I understand not to excuse it, I still canceled on you day off. But can I, are you gonna read your response or can I read yours? I don't think it's, yours is great. So you say, you say Dax, I called your line producer and you aren't even in the cast.

Speaker 3:          00:41:06       He said you never got the role and haven't worked in months. You need help man. No problem. Let's do it some other time. It's not like I'm terminally ill or anything off to the doctor now Conan, right. This is a brilliant response. And then I respond Hahahahaha I give you like nine hah. Aha. You know how funny I thought it was quote, I called your line producer. I'm even quoting you. Yeah, you wrote back, I was told that's a thing. Yeah, a little self deprecation at the end. Now I look at that as a big victory for both of us. It wasn't a victory. And you know what? I wasn't upset. I wasn't upset. The only reason I'm, we're talking about this now is that you insisted by, we never had cast that. You would never do that. And I just had to set the record straight that on the ides of March, you stabbed me in the back.

Speaker 3:          00:41:51       I did once you bleed on the steps and the vote on the Senate floor. Um, but no, it is, you know, it is, we're going to get together and you and I are going to talk about history and maybe the ladies can't be, maybe the ladies can't be there if we're going to talk about history. Well that's the other most predictable outcome of our night at the farmer's daughter hotel is that you and I probably will just start passionately rolling around in the, in the binding of a grant biography. Yes, exactly. Marrying the pages on his said, uh, listen, I gotta say that was probably my favorite moment you and I ever had on your show was I was going through what I think I am out of 10. Do you recall this? You probably don't. I do. I'm a six but, but, but lucky for us men, women subconsciously average your personality in your looks and that's what they're seeing.

Speaker 3:          00:42:47       So I was telling you, well, my personality is a Tan. It looks for a six. Thank God my wife sees an eight when I walk in the door. Yeah. And then you said to me, what am I? And I said, well, your looks or a five and you came unglued. And I'm like, well, hold on, I'm only giving myself six. Do you remember that? And that was really cool. It was a five. I still don't understand. There's no comedy. If I say six, there's comedy. If I say you want to lower the whole thing was that you're being sincere on podcasts. I am on your show. I'm a liar and an instigator and a provocate tour. Right. But marriage challenge, all those guys. What am I, we're on the podcast now. I think you and I are very comparable. I think you're a six. I think I'm higher than that.

Speaker 3:          00:43:32       Okay. What do you think you are okay. I've got, first of all, I think if I got a few things fixed, not the listen to me. I have host makeover assessment. I have fin, unattractive lips. Get those plumped out. Okay. I have rat. Like guys, I have BDI and I have an eye vein that shows up on camera and uh, and I, if I could get those things, I have killer hair. I haven't, I'm a 12 when it comes to, well, you can't go over 10. Okay. I'm a 10 in hair. Okay. Uh, I've got, uh, I've work out. My body is in pretty good shape. It is. Yeah. And I give myself from my age, I'm going to give myself an eight on that. Uh, but yeah, I got to get ready out. Go Higher. I'd say if we're just talking your physique at 55, you're at nine.

Speaker 3:          00:44:19       Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So you're saying my grade down shit, my face drags me down to a, well, no, I'm not, I'm not averaging your body. I'm just going with your face and your personality. Okay. What's wrong with the personality? It's great. It's a 10. He's a 10. Your looks are five key guilty. It makes you a 7.5. I've only got you by 0.5 in my scenario. I don't, you don't accept that it's good for you. You've got a competitive flair. I got to fix this thing. We got it. You, I gotta really some fillers it sounds like is what you want. You want some fillers in your lips? I want lips filler. I have to have the eyes, uh, opened up a little bit cause when I looked from sign up to go to Asia for that, that's a procedure that's done. I, when I look from side to side, I look like one of those.

Speaker 3:          00:45:05       I looked like a rat looking around to see if the room is safe to enter and I want that to go away. Okay. We can fix that. Yeah. And you can see my veins through my skin because of my, my Pale that we're stuck with. Unless you want to wear an eye patch because they can't make your skin thicker. To my knowledge, I was thinking of having the, I moved but then I found out that it supplies most of the blood to my brain. Okay. Then let's not do that. Although you know what you could do is you could use this great product Latiece that women use to make their eyelashes thicker. I think if we got your eyelashes so thick and powerful, it could distract from that vein you don't like. Okay. What do you think of that? I'll do it. Okay, great. I think what we took away from all of this, and maybe this is why, I dunno, you sorta gave away the ending too.

Speaker 3:          00:45:49       Maybe this whole podcast, which is that I may not want a lot of friends. I have a couple of friends who are really good friends and I have, uh, I have friends that go back 35 years who I talked to all the time once, twice a week. Yeah. I'm really close with those people. You're also someone who historically has, uh, remained friends with people you've worked with think is a pretty good sign. Yes. Oh No. I'm a loyal friend. I just, I don't think I'm looking, that's why you've ruined this podcast. I try. I'm hoping to, I don't think at the end of the day, I would love to hang with you whenever we can make that happen, but I don't think I'm looking for a lot of celebrity friends and I think we have to change the name of the podcast. Well, do they have to be celebrity friends? What's the point of having a regular friend while at celebrity front and bring up, you bring up a good point. It's going to sound terrible, but I'm, I do very well with the common man. Aw, I'm sure that's what the guy who installed your smoke detector told them in the hallway. He was doing some work here. So I said, hey, they had common man. I know you are applied.

Speaker 3:          00:47:07       Did you have any problem getting your mule up the driveway? All right, we got to wrap this right. You are a, you're an ex new feel how much I like, you know, I keep trying to make this go longer. Do you feel me trying to make this go longer because it's more time with you. I do and it's pushing me away. I'm going to feel needy. Yeah, it's going to, it's coming out. It's a very neat. Okay. Um, but uh, loved this so much. Also, I'm, I can't believe this hasn't come up yet. You are a, you have, you're killing it in the podcast world. So I am absolutely thrilled that you and that you took the time to, to come here and do this because this is your, this is your main ta. I don't know what that word means. It's not French. She said correctly. It sounds like Matt and Matt, like the Latin format may be seen as something I do in the afternoons. Okay. No, this is just, this is what you do. You've, uh, you took to it like a duck to water that hadn't been in water before, but then immediately like the water. All right. God bless you. You're a good man. I love you Conan O'brien. I love you too. Dax Shepard.

Speaker 1:          00:48:13       And now another segment of Conan O'brien pays off the mortgage on his beach house.

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       Give it's okay. So now I'd like to talk about a sensitive issue if that's cool with you. Um, it's about guys in a certain health problem, but not going to say this as delicately as I can, but, uh, it's erectile dysfunction. You know, that's something that, uh, some men struggle with. You know, guys feel awkward discussing it. I feel awkward discussing it right now because we're, I mean, first of all because I'm discussing it here and you're my assistant. That's strange. But also I feel a little awkward debt in this room right now. There's about 150 people. I don't know why we have that many people in here. It seems, it seems silly. You're also, you're a repressed Irish Catholic. Yes. And very repressed. I don't discuss sexual matters. That has never been my way and uh, but this is something we should talk about. It's something that's healthy to talk about.

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       A lot of guys out there have trouble with Ed and uh, there's this product Roman that's created an easy way to get checked out by a doctor and then get treated for erectile dysfunction on the line. And let me just say something as a guide and please let me be very clear. I have not had this issue myself yet. Could happen anytime now, but it's hard to discuss this with anybody. There have been times where I've been talking to a doctor and I haven't wanted to bring up, hey, what if I someday need that a drug for rectal dysfunction. So what I try and do is pretend I'm talking about a head cold, you know, like I've got a really bad head cold and it's really bad and I'm worried someday the head cold might give me Ed and then he says, do you want an Ed drug?

Speaker 1:          00:50:07       And I'm like, no man, I don't need that. Just talking about my head cold. So it goes through all these different and I don't even have it. You keep saying you don't have it. It's me. It's making me think you might have it and I might have it. Well, if I was a guy and I had this, I wouldn't want to, I would just want to do it like take care of it quietly. Really? Yeah. You wouldn't want to put an ad the paper and said, I have erectile dysfunction is anybody know what to do? And then a picture of yourself, is that what you did? We didn't want, she was mistake. Hmm. Point is there's no waiting rooms. There's no awkward face to face where you say to the doctor or your dentist or whoever you're going to, I need an erectile dysfunction drug.

Speaker 1:          00:50:46       I had a guy fitting me for a ThoughtWorks once the shoe store and I said, can you get me, uh, an erectile dysfunction drug? I was escorted out of the shoe store very quickly. Anyway, a handle, everything online. All you have to do is visit. Get roman.com/conan that's right. My dreams fulfilled. Fill out a brief medical onboarding, chat with a doctor, get FDA approved, erectile dysfunction meds delivered to your door discreetly. Maybe even could put something else on the package. Here's that drug you need to keep you from having a constant direction. Would that be great? Like, yeah, man, I'm just ready to go 24, seven and it's a problem because I work literally around Hummel figurines and I'm always smashing them, man. Even Gorley's laughing at this one was hard to get too specific. I know, but you work at, at Hummel figurines store, you've got a constant erection.

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       You turn, what's that smash. But is it to my rights smash? You just broke 35 little Hummel figurines, poor little alpine boy and later hose and hiking up a hill. He knew what he knew what he was in for a and that's it. That's an idea of Roman wants to use that. Go ahead and use it, but actually I'm all joking aside. I think this is a, you know, sounds like a good idea. For a free online visit, go to get Roman dotcom slash Conan. That's get roman.com/conan for a free online visit. Get roman.com/conan it's time to have an erection again. Is that right? Tried to think of a slogan. Roman, it's time to have an erection. I don't see what's wrong with that. Roman, can you imagine if we got like James Earl Jones to say that Roman, it's time to have an erection again. That's a good, I don't see anything wrong with that. That tells you exactly what's happening with this product. You're welcome, Roman. You can have that for free. God, I don't understand how you make money in this business. He's drawing pictures of erections on his head. Copy. In all fairness, those pictures of erections were drawn long before I read this Ad. All right. You know, some artists work in clay, some in oils. I draw your reactions. All right, well you want some Clinton really happy about right now my parents don't know how to get a podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:53:27       Hi everyone. This is Matt again. So there's some things slightly unique with this one and that you guys have semi concrete plans to actually hang out as friends. Do you think that that actually going to happen? Yeah, I do for sure. I have a lot of shortcomings, but I am an, again, March 15th excluded. I am a man of my word. It did seem like you took great pains to show how stressed you are that I included a document when I my comment, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I definitely think we will hang out sooner or later he'll move east or I'll move west. There's no way we'll end our lives separated like this. You'll do it for each other. No, no. But just by some other set of circumstance, you've gone deeper than anyone else that's far, so thank you for that. Okay, thank you.

Speaker 4:          00:54:17       Sana? Yes. It's time to play a little game. We call true or false with sona much. [inaudible] y'all said not really. Okay, here we go. We were just a on tour. Of course, Conan working hard. I'd go out and I do my, you know, 40 minutes up top. Then I go out at the end. I'm working hard going city to city, 18 city tour a year there do help me out too. Or false. You left me on the last leg of the tour you took off. True or false? True. Ben, did you leave me with anyone to help me? No. You left me alone? Yes. Would you like to talk about that at all? Did you feel bad about it? No. Okay. I don't feel bad about it. She took off and then it was up to me to carry on by myself and it was tough. I'm not trying to make you feel guilty or anything, but if I were you, I'd feel a lot of guilt.

Speaker 4:          00:55:11       At first. I liked how you, you said a code and working hard. I just have to get that out to any of this. Like talking in the third person when I hear you talk about this, I just here, you're so valuable that when you leave there's a hole in my life. That's a nice way to look at it. And you know what? You are valuable to me. So when you left, um, I thought, I hope this is for a good reason. Where'd you go? I went to a wedding. Whose wedding? I went to my friend on I his wedding. My friend [inaudible] and Roger got married in London. In London. She a close relative? No. Oh no, she's a friend. You just went to a friend's wedding. I went to a friend's wedding. Yeah, I did. Did you think at all? Maybe I shouldn't go because I'm with Conan on this important tour.

Speaker 4:          00:55:59       Do you want me to be honest? Of course. I didn't think about it at all. I also, I don't even know if I told you that I wasn't going to be there until like you did like a day before he did. And that's another point. You didn't say anything to me like, you know, a month from now because you had to buy tickets to go to London. You had to make big arrangements to go. You didn't say anything to me. You just day before like, Oh yeah, I'm not here tomorrow. You're on your own. Good luck getting all of your shit together. Good luck with your tour. Laughy chimpy boy. And then you took off and you donate. Who is this person? I've never even heard her name before. Laughy chimpy boy. No, Nas. Who's nae? So I don't even know her. Her. She's a friend of mine every time.

Speaker 4:          00:56:49       Oh God, you have so many fives. Real popular. I know, but, but sometimes I think you throw around the term friend a little loosely because you're just like, oh yeah, she's my friend. They got to go to London. Did you really have to go right now? Do you think you made the right call? Yes. I don't regret it even for a second. I uh, uh, yeah, I do. You should. You should not be a lot. So what I really did was you like having rifts where you make fun of how terrible I am at my job. So I just stepped away from that for a few days. So if you're asking me, hey, did you miss me making fun of you incessantly for a few days so you could go to London for a wedding? A Ah, it wasn't a hard decision to make it all. Okay. Quick question. You left, left me in the lurch. Uh, but then you said that you were going to be back for the next, the show at the start of the next part of the leg, which was in Chicago. Were you there in time to go with us to Chicago?

Speaker 4:          00:57:57       No, that's right. You weren't. What, what happened there? My flight got canceled. Could you leave a little buffer there for that flight back so you can get back to you? Important job? No, I want you to maximize my time in London. So I booked the fight for the morning of the show. You booked the flight in London for the morning of my show in Chicago that you were supposed to be at and then, oops. Oh, that didn't work out. You're on your own again. Chimpy boy. But it my defense. Do you make fun of me a lot? I do. I'm good at it. It might be the thing I'm best at now. Now listen, let's make sure that we're honest here. Do you make fun of me a lot? Yes I do. It's what I'm best at. I think we are both. I think in each other we have the person.

Speaker 4:          00:58:44       Isn't it crazy that the person your best make it making fun of in the world is Conan O'brien and the person I'm best at making fun of in the world is sort of assessing and then we happened to meet. Yes. And we happen to work together. This is like Lennon Meeting Mccartney. It's magical. I don't understand that reference at all. I'm sorry. They were singers a long before there were, uh, you know, apps and spo that Lennon and McCarthey McCartney. Wait, did you think I was talking about Vladimir Lenin and Joel and Joe McCarthy? Yes. Yeah, you're right. You know what you're like, you're like, you're like, I'm Vladimir Lenin and you were red baiting redbaiting Cami Hunter. Joe McCarthy. Yes. Perfect. It's perfect analogy. We're the perfect analogy Carthy and I was like Lennon, him, Ricardo and understand that her leash, oh my God, this is great. I actually think we're perfect as you know what? Let's leave it that way. Vladimir Lenin and Joseph McCarthy, that's what we are together. So one of us has a stroke at a pretty young age and the other one dies of alcoholism. I'm happy you're going to be the stroke one.

Hello from the magic tavern, a chat show I host from the magical land of food with my cohost use at all the blue wizard and chunk the shape shifter. Most weeks we interview adventurers, wedding planners, ambulatory trees, but this week we have a special episode. I am so excited to learn about the Earth Law in pride and prejudice. We're going to do a book club up pride and prejudice. And you said this is a well of both on earth, right? Yeah. It's one of those books that people love or were forced to read or more likely it's one of those, I'm going to get to it, and some of our most beloved of guests are rich hurting to read the book with us and enjoy some drinks and food. Have a book club. We are flower. We have chrome, the barbarian and girl. You know who they are. Maybe you don't give a crap about what an academic thinks about Jane Austen, but don't you want to know what a wizard and a badge or think about it. Not enough spells, not enough, not enough sword fights. Whether you love pride and prejudice or have no interest in reading it and just want to listen to a book club going really off the rails. You'll enjoy this week's hello from the magic tavern. We shall defeat this book.
