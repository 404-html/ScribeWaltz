Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Sonja, has your husband ever been rushing out the door and he's wanted to shave his back, but he didn't have the time. He didn't have the time to do it. Shave his back. I am uncomfortable talking about my husband's grooming habits. Well, that's a yes. This is the cool thing. There's a device called the back blade 2.0 it's the ultimate man grooming tool and it would allow your husband, if he shaved his back, he could do it in minutes, so if you had an appointment or someplace he had to be and wanted to shave his back. Done. Know what I'm saying? It offers a clean, close shave more so than other bodily groomers and get this, the unique patented dry glide blades. It allows him to shave with or without shaving cream and water. That's great. That really cuts down on the time because how do you put shaving cream on your back? Oh, trust me. You have to get other men involved. That's what I've done. You meet people though. Anyway, this Christmas, tell your man to ditch that ugly Christmas sweater, which I guess refers to his body hair the heck I've never anyway. And get him a back blade 2.0 available at [inaudible] dot com that's B a k B a l a d.com. They forced me to spell.

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       Obviously everybody knows now that you cannot drink and drive. There are probably people that think it's okay to drive when you're stoned. They just think, well, I'll probably just drive a little slower. But that's not the case. Your reaction time is affected. Um, when you're high and you're putting yourself in danger, you're putting other people in danger. So just a quick no joking around message, don't kid yourself. If you've been using marijuana in any form, do not get behind the wheel. Um, if you feel different, you actually drive different. It's just that simple. And this is something I'm, I'm very serious about. If you drive high, you're going to get a Dui and much scary than that. You can end up really hurting someone, uh, yourself included. So just a reminder.

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       Hi, my name is Nick Offerman

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       and my name is Megan Mullally.

Speaker 3:          00:02:17       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:02:19       And I, I dunno about you, but I feel ambivalent about being Conan O'Brien's friend. I felt really good about it. I hope to,

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       hey, welcome to Conan O'brien needs a friend. This is the podcast where I Conan talk to people I've interviewed over the years on my TV job. Try and figure

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       out what's really the deal with us. Are we friends? He said all fake. What's really happening? And I'm joined in this quest, if you will, by a among Saskia and my assistant and a podcast. Extraordinary Ian, if that's even a word. Matt Gorley. Hi. Okay. And today I'm talking to two of my favorite people ever. I absolutely adore them. Megan Mullally and nick off.

Speaker 4:          00:03:33       I do think of all the people I've talked to, we are legitimate legitimately friends. We have gone out socially many times. What was that noise you made? You made a noise. It was, it was involuntary. What the hell was it? You seem skeptical about this whole thing. Let's just, let's just keep chatting. You were saying were we've gone out many times. Several, I wouldn't say Manny, we've gone out many times. Okay. We got many times. Uh, going back to, I mean years, years and years and years, 15 years. I absolutely love you guys. I love you individually. And I'm saying this, this isn't even a comedy riff, but as a United force, you're greater than uh, your, your separate parts. Does that make sense? You haven't seen all of my separate parts, so you might revise that. Oh my God, she's taking off her clothes right now and I do revise that.

Speaker 4:          00:04:34       She's good. She's got a great, uh, she's got a great set of talents. Now. I, I made an incorrect assumption. I didn't realize this was a sincere conversation. It isn't really what I like to do is when you go insincere, I go sincere. I startle you and, and then you start to get to see her and then I slam you with insincerity. Freaking loves you. He considers you a king among men. And that's not a chat. It's nice. I, I will lie in eyes. You at any given opportunity, he does. Well that's right. Lion eyes or you want to hear that a lot anymore when you first hear it, it makes it the word sounds like it means I will tear you apart like Elian as opposed to I will hold you in high regard. Right. I will render you the king of any given jungle. That's so nice of you. Only is this big words when he's being interviewed. But at home he's just like, Ugh, like cake.

Speaker 4:          00:05:39       There's no better way to say really. There's no, uh, I'm gonna say this. I don't want to embarrass your both embarrass you, but you're both a supremely talented people, but you're also real human beings. You're nice, good ethical people. I've that demonstrated in private many, many, many times. And I admire that about you both. I think that. Thank you. That's very, very nice. He was [inaudible] that's sincere. I feel like the reason that, um, we have had so many double dates with you and you're beautiful and even killed wife Liza as that, whereas we have similarities in that department as couples, as couples. But I will say there are differences which is um, lies and I are both a little over pressed you to our sexual animals. Yeah, I let it hang out. I mean we have talked about this before but you are quite open about the fact that your beast like and I mean that as a compliment or you mean your anal not anal.

Speaker 4:          00:06:51       No, I didn't mean ane. Okay. Why did you go to angel? Well beastiality in the Bible I think is referring to and the, but I didn't, I said beast like beastiality we'll get to that and listen. Maybe that's something you guys are into. I don't know. And I've, and I've never in my life, he just said never in my life have I said I want to read about butt sex. Whereas my Bible just never occurred to me. Well Old Testament, New Testament Leviticus specifically, that's where all the good stuff is. Okay. Thank you. The Leviticus is the home of abominations. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:07:36       So, but you too, I mean you've told me personally stories about the two of you being in nature in the woods fornicating and that it's this beautiful act. And that animals are, are watching you in Congress. Can I use that term? Coyotes. Coyotes. Coyotes watched you have sex. Where was this? It was in a park and cold water. Cold Water Canyon here in Los Angeles. So we were like, uh, like on a beautiful camping trip. We are literally in the middle of the city. Oh. So anyone could have opened their back door seeing you two going at it and thrown cold water on you. Right. You were in an almost an urban area, but you found a sort of magical, we found the wooded area, a little corner, a secluded area.

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       It was early on and it, uh, I feel like so many of the pleasures in our marriage, uh, have been cruise directed by Megan. And this was no exception. Uh, it was after our play, one night we went to a fancy grocery store, which was a new thing for me and got a baguette and cheeses and a bottle of Nice wine and, and she, she knew the park. Uh, she may have

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       been there before me, wasn't my first coyote.

Speaker 6:          00:09:02       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:09:08       That or user like she's back in the squirrels are like, oh, this guy does.

Speaker 4:          00:09:18       Uh, [inaudible]. And I'll be honest, I'd have been, I'm very ashamed of my own body and I'm not comfortable. I don't think I'd be naked out in the world ever. I won't take my clothes off from my doctor. And then you to, you must've seen in nick that he was capable of shedding his clothes and becoming almost this, this naked Werewolf. Yeah. Could commune with nature and satisfy your most base urgent.

Speaker 5:          00:09:46       Yeah. That's one thing that I, I liked about nick is that he's a really nice guy, but he's also sort of like a demonic, you know, serial killer. So there's both sides of that because there's somebody too nice all the time. You just want to punch him in the face in the morning. Yeah. And then the guys that are really bad or bad. Yeah. He strikes a balance. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:10       I get a, um, Seder vibe from you, nick. You know, it was the old half man, half goat with, with a big genitals that that plays a fight for and goes through the woods and only wants to have sex constantly and lives for today. That's what I get partially from you

Speaker 5:          00:10:27       let you know when I first met nick, I had only ever dated these really like Sperry skinny, boyish, kind of hairless and draw basically gay guys. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:10:38       You know, up until the end you are describing me.

Speaker 5:          00:10:41       Yes. Up until the aunt and I'm to go ahead. And then I met nick and I didn't really know what to make of it all and he at the time, back then, that was in 2000 he was like, I take like 40 pounds heavier. Sure. He was a big, big man and he was bald for the play. He shaved his head for the plan. He had a mustache and it wasn't that cute. I mean there's a lot of back hair. I remember

Speaker 4:          00:11:11       when I first met you too, it was a Saturday night live reunion show. I had not met you and you came up and you introduce me to nick. And Nick was wearing a big leather biker jacket and he had a big chain hanging off and everyone else there was, you know, prince was there and you know, in sync. And it was just this ridiculous gathering of, uh, of, of people that were all dressed in their finery, the grapes, all the grades. Um, I think boys to men were present. The Archie's were there and then you show up and did, uh, you kind of look like, um, it was interesting because my first take was this is not what I expected. This is not what I expected

Speaker 5:          00:12:02       you introduced me. I mean there was, there was a progression of events and next, um, sartorial styles stylings because when I first met him, he was wearing a pair of golden overalls that he would write. He used as a notepad basically. So if he needed to write some his phone number down here, just ride it cause he couldn't afford, you know, paper. And he was living in, uh, an unfinished basement of somebody is unfinished basement that didn't have, are an actual floor or walls. So he could urinate indiscriminately in any given corner of his lodgings. You would do that? Well, I mean wouldn't you? I'd use a jar. I've been in that situation and I couldn't afford a jar. I mean I would, I would get, I would get a few feet away from my bed. Oh I wasn't so you're civilized. Yeah, it wasn't an animal.

Speaker 5:          00:12:58       Yeah. So it started, that's where we, that was the jumping off point and then by the time we went to like a fancy thing, he was really like his idea of high style was turquoise jewelry and a crazy leather jacket. He's still, you can tell. I still really, that's his dream. Yeah. So yeah. I I had actually met you. I just want to revise. I'm just for the record, cause I know this is going to go down in history. I had, I had done your shot. You had already met me. I met as a couple the first time I

Speaker 4:          00:13:31       met you guys together because now I think of you as one person. Yes. We are wanting to become Sonny and Cher. Yeah. Woodward and Bernstein. Um, you know, you're, you don't mention one without the other. You're a peanut butter and jelly. You're Leopold and Loeb. Look it up. Kids, they were terrible, terrible killers. Uh, without remorse in the 1920s, they were executed. I mean, right now they were not executed. They were put in a prison for life. One was killed in prison, the other was released. Uh, and I think you have the late sixties, early seventies, moved to Puerto Rico and died there two years later. Why do I know that? I don't know a lot like them. And Ken was a little, we went down one of my warm halls, Leopold and Loeb kids look it up. One of the great murder stories of all time. But there isn't time for that.

Speaker 4:          00:14:19       There's only time for you. Um, Megan, we've talked a lot about your family, uh, in private and you've asked me never to discuss it publicly. And this is a podcast, so when I don't think that counts, you describe your family and first of all, let me compliment you on the book, the book, the greatest love story ever told on the New York Times bestseller list and also the Los Angeles Times best seller list. Yeah, Nigga Malawi. Nick Offerman, the greatest love story ever told to buy it if for no other reason than just the book jacket is the best book jacket I have seen. I don't, I think in memory

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       book jacket as well as all the photos in the book, uh, were the brainchild of Megan. She art directed all of it.

Speaker 4:          00:15:00       It's really beautifully done and these are great photos, fantastic photos

Speaker 5:          00:15:06       and they let me design the whole back, which for me was a huge thing because I don't usually get that kind of autonomy on any project. I'm just the hired help,

Speaker 4:          00:15:16       you have so many talents. People can sort of almost take it for granted that you're this great comedic actress, but you're also an amazing singer. I've seen you perform many times and you would be famous in your own right as a singer. Then I go to your home and you, your first question you want to ask is what fancy person did you get to get you this art in this sculpture? And you did it. You love collecting and finding art and you're incredibly talented at it and you could also make it as a top designer home design.

Speaker 5:          00:15:50       That's probably what I would do if I wasn't doing all the actings and things

Speaker 4:          00:15:56       you think you would really be a home designer

Speaker 5:          00:15:58       am almost at a certain point when I wasn't getting a lot of work as an actor. I am most general tried to enroll at Ucla to study interior design.

Speaker 4:          00:16:09       I mean that it sort of takes your breath away. The Times I've been allowed in your home and the Times I've also gone in when you're not there, uh, it, uh, it takes your breath away. The other thing that takes your breath away is I would admire the furniture and it's absurd, but much of it has been designed and built by Mr Nick Offerman. It's insane. I'll walk up to the nicest piece of furniture in the house. Oh, nick made that. I haven't made anything since. I think I had popsicle sticks and I tray I traced my hand to make a Turkey and then I put pop popsicle sticks over it and recently sold at Southerby's for $2.30.

Speaker 2:          00:16:50       Well, uh, it's um, it may be immodest of me to say this, but I think Megan's greatest talent is her taste. She almost, anything she puts her hand to is astonishing. She wants to cut our poodle's hair.

Speaker 5:          00:17:06       Yeah. I cut our pills hair for years

Speaker 2:          00:17:08       and it was cuter than anything uh, Pixar has ever envisioned.

Speaker 5:          00:17:13       Sometimes. You know, the thing though is I'm doggedly determined to not educate myself in any of these areas. Like I never studied acting. I never, I don't know anything about art. I just pick stuff that I like. And then, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:17:28       you know, this is infuriating to so many people listening. So I think it's really appealing about both of you when I'm around you, is that you're doing stuff that you love. It comes out of a need. Like you need to make things out of wood. You need to decorate, you need to make people laugh. You need to sing.

Speaker 5:          00:17:45       Well you do too. I mean you, you know, we need to express ourselves creatively.

Speaker 4:          00:17:49       I don't,

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       I just need desperately want the cash and this was the best way to get it fast. I need a lot of cash because I made some bad mistakes. But you said Megan, I think you, you described your family as very small, mostly dead and crazy. I mean, my family is scattered throughout institutions across the US. And your dad was up like a practical joker but not necessarily a funny practical joker? No, he was, I had a very dark sense of humor and for like a couple of examples of his humor would be he and my mom and I would be sitting at the dinner table and then my father would all of a sudden pretend that he was having a massive heart attack and then fall over. He'd really, you know, he did commit, I'll give him that fall over endo has played of, you know, spaghetti or whatever. And the first time he did it, my mom and I were like, is he dead or what's going on? And then after that we were just kinda like, you know, get out of the Spaghetti and then another time I guess.

Speaker 4:          00:18:54       So your reaction when you thought it was real was to just wonder, Huh? Wonder if that's real or not? Yeah, well, I mean I knew it was terrifying because I was, you know, eight so it was really scary. I'm, I'm downplaying it for the sake of, you know, podcast listeners everywhere. I don't want to try,

Speaker 5:          00:19:15       I want to be taken into child services. Um, but uh, then another thing that he did was like, I used to take the bus. The only year I took the bus was third grade. So say I was nine and I came in the door. I didn't like being alone with my father because he was really terrifying. And so I came in the door and my mom's car wasn't there and my father was standing at the top of the stairs and I said, where's mommy? And he said he had this focal affectation that he did all the time. He said, I'm sorry to tell you this, my and I met your mother is dead. And I for a second I was like, wait. And then he said, and then you just kind of went on. He elaborated on how she had died and it was like a lot of, some, some children lose their parents at an early age and it wasn't going to be an easy life. And, um, and finally I said, you know, where is she? And he said the grocery store.

Speaker 4:          00:20:13       Oh my God. Yeah. He also told me one time, no, it wasn't cute. And he also

Speaker 5:          00:20:20       tell me one time when I was in high school that um, he'd had to go to the doctor because he had a little skin cancer lesion or his ear. So he had to have it. Like Marie moved. And I talked to him on the phone because my parents had been separated by them and I said, how did it go? And he said, well, I'm sorry to tell you this, my darling. But they had to take the air and I said, Oh, what? And he goes, yes, I don't want to frighten your little friends when I come by the house. And I, I said, I'm sorry to hear that. And he then did not correct himself until I saw him two weeks later and he had two ears and I was like, and he'd already forgotten about it by then.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       Yeah. Thing is, he's clearly not amusing you. So who is this for? Is it just for himself?

Speaker 5:          00:21:14       Teeny weeny sociopathic.

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       A little in the cute, cute sociopath's. Yeah. Unlike Leopold and Loeb, no kids. I just stay true sociopath. I need to take a quick break, but we have so much more to talk about now it's time for this segment. Conan O'brien pays off the mortgage on his beach house during that. Why you start to laugh? It's not funny. It's a big mortgage. You made so many bad decisions is a bad decision. I think in the long run it will end up being a good decision. But in the short period of time right now, I need to make some money. Okay. Okay. Then we're going to do that right now. Pay Down that mortgage.

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       Well, I kind of wanted to talk about this new APP. It's one that, uh, actually sounds pretty cool.

Speaker 1:          00:24:33       Hey, you know what I was thinking about the other day? What? How much I love, uh, I love, uh, meet all kinds of protein, whether it's chicken or beef, yogurt. I eat a lot of meat, don't you? You were just thinking about how much you love meat. Yeah. What all kinds of stuff could you see my thought balloon over my head? It was a pork chop and it was a steak. Anyway, I love, I love really good meat, but it has to be good meat. I have to know where it's been. I have to know that it was, you know, good beef, a hundred percent grass fed chicken, pork. I need to know that. And that's why I trust the people at butcher box.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       I don't know if that's true. I think they do. I think they just quietly slip away and uh, they've had a happy life and then you can taste that. And the flavor. I like when I'm eating a chicken or a beef, I like to know that it just passed away and it's bed surrounded by its relatives. Okay. Each box that you get, this is great. They send it to you. Each box comes with at least nine to 11 pounds of meat. That's enough for 24 individuals sized meals. No, it's not. Not In my family growing up. That's insane. Can you imagine my family, if there was nine to 11 pounds of meat, that's one meal. Yeah, there were too many of you are, too many of us anyway. My parents did that. Not me.

Speaker 2:          00:27:54       What do you think or come by it honest? I mean I, uh, when I got to show business, it was interesting. I did recognize immediately how superficial it was an I was immediately disinterested and I said, okay, I'm not going to chase this particular brass ring. I'm going to continue working as a carpenter. And they have my number. If they, if they need a slow talking guy to drive a bus or you know, play a plumber, they'll find me. And eventually, but by dribs and drabs, you know, the business and I came together. But I'm in hindsight, I'm grateful that I had that wherewithal. I Dunno, it comes from, I think my parents from just having the sensibility to, to look at it at any given context and say, okay, all my peers that are putting themselves through this auditioning process, they're all stressed out. They're all depressed, they're all drinking way too much, and uh, I can do that. Sure. And still get paid to hammer nails. Um, and so I, I can't, uh, I can't claim any great knowledge, you know, of my own accord. I think I'm just lucky

Speaker 4:          00:29:06       and you know, I've changed, I think I've changed a lot since we first met. And you've changed a lot since we first met.

Speaker 2:          00:29:13       I wash myself as often as once a week now.

Speaker 4:          00:29:17       Yeah. That's what the three stooges used to say. They would crash through the floor and all three of them would land in a bathtub and one of them go like, but it's not Sunday. And I always thought that was, I didn't get that joke when I was a kid and then later on I grew up and realized, cause we only had to take a bath like once a week. But then I later on realized that that's considered uncouth, that you're supposed to have a bath once or twice, you know, every couple of days it really, anytime you begin to stink, oh okay. Well I should, I could do better then. Yeah. Your step up your, again, I'm going to tell a quick story and I know I've told this, recounted this to many people, but when Megan was in Seattle and you were doing, um, the young Frankenstein and lies and I were there visiting her family, so we hung out a little bit and we went to see you in the show, which we absolutely loved.

Speaker 4:          00:30:09       You killed it. And one day I mentioned I like to ride bikes and Nick said, let's ride bikes together. So the two of us, one of those long bike turned into, took his way south of Lake Washington and, and then all of a sudden I heard like a popping explosion sound and Nick's change just exploded it, which can happen sometimes on a bike. And I'll, I'll say that as an experienced bikes man. So you know, I'm really ride bikes. It exploded in pieces when everywhere, and now I know me, I would have gotten off the bike and said, oh shit, my bike blew up. This was pre Uber or anything like that. But I guess I just have to pick it up or hide it in a Bush and then go walk and find a cab. Nick gathers all the pieces and I said, what are you doing?

Speaker 4:          00:30:51       And he said, well I think this can be fixed. And then he said, I just need a flat rock. And I didn't know, I thought he was doing a bit and he didn't know you as well. And then you went and you found a flat rock and this is me telling exactly what happened. You assembled all the pieces and you lay them out on a flat rock and then you found another rock and you were inspected them all and then you found the right one and you started hammering the pieces back together again until after about 40 minutes you had completely reassembled the chain using prehistoric tools you got on and then you went on your way and when I brought it up later on, you acted as if anyone else I would be bragging about that for years you acted like it was unmanly of me to even mention it. This is what one does when their bicycle, when a machine breaks, you find rocks and you fix it and then you're on your way. What's your problem city boy, that's just, that's just proper comportment. I think you could have made a, if you needed to in that moment or radio using using twigs and a dead rabbit and some manure. I think you could have made a pretty good am FM radio that also got serious. If you

Speaker 5:          00:32:05       that's it's so true. And we seriously, for many years, because we watched the show survivor religiously and then to the season finales for the last two years, we have always said that we thought that nick would kill on survivor for them. So those very reasons.

Speaker 4:          00:32:22       Have you ever thought about that you'd go on a celebrity survivor and you could clean it up?

Speaker 5:          00:32:26       Celebrity just regular

Speaker 4:          00:32:29       it's been discussed. Yeah. I mean we, we've sincerely looked at it in reality it was

Speaker 5:          00:32:35       actually maybe going to happen and then he got another, like an acting

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       job. Yeah. The thing of the things that you would really do it, you wouldn't really go on survivor. I would love to. I mean, I think it'd be really fun. I don't know. I think it'd be good at some things, but I'm not certain that I would be, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:32:51       thank you. Wouldn't be good at, because I can't think of one thing you wouldn't be good at.

Speaker 4:          00:32:55       Uh, I, I'm not sure how well I would fare in the social aspect of the game because everybody freaking all loves you. Right. But you don't play games right. He doesn't, he has no, he has no guidance.

Speaker 5:          00:33:09       Big Edit. The lying. Yeah, his brain. He's not aft up enough to think of how to square it.

Speaker 4:          00:33:18       And also you would probably say something like you are kind of, okay, go on. Sorry. No, no, go ahead.

Speaker 5:          00:33:23       One time we were staying in a hotel, I was in Seattle and we were there for seven or eight weeks and we had been in this same room for the whole time and we are moved and like we were living there right? And they were like, oh, but there's this one weekend where we have to move you out of the room because we, it's a honeymoon situation and we promise these people like, you know, two years ago that they could have this year suite for the weekend. And we were like, wait, we have to move all over everything. So Nick, I'm really surprised me with his revenge fantasies. And the one I remember most distinctly was moving all our stuff out and be like, okay fine. No problem. We'll just move into another room for the weekend. We'll move all, pack up, all of our belongings. It's fine. Um, as we're doing that, nick would some how procure a dead to dead rats, which she would put, he would unscrew the heating the event over the heating system. Yeah. And he would put the dead rats in there and then screw the thing back on and then turn the heat on

Speaker 4:          00:34:35       and slowly dead rats that would fill that room described it to me in such to do, like he'd thought it out down to the last detail. I do that, I think about it, but I don't do it right. So now this my assistant, so I just jump in for a second. Yeah. I have a great, I have a lot of pent up Irish rage and I have a good imagination. I think of great things I could, I could do, but I never do them. Right. Right. But a lot of them have to do with murder too, about how you would murder and it, so it gets a little bit more dark than putting rats in event, which is also really screwed up. Sorry. It's a good idea what you have. Sure. I, uh, if the other day, you know, I'm trying to watch my, I've been trying to eat well and uh, I've been told, you know, you can occasionally have a steak but has to be really lean.

Speaker 4:          00:35:27       Just make sure it has no sauce on. I meant this, she, she restaurant, it's actually more of a hipstery restaurant and they have a stake that they serve and it's the steak. It's a really lean cut and it just comes with vegetables. And it was the perfect thing for me to eat. And I was hungry and it says, yeah, and we smother it in this butter sauce. And I said, great, I'll have that, but just could you just, uh, could I not have the butter sauce and this guy in like a tweed cap wearing suspenders with a, with like a, a hipstery mustache said, no, you have to take it the way we, and I said, no, all I'm asking for is, you know, the stuff that I'm not allowed to eat, can you just not have that? And the guy went, hey man, that's not our scene here.

Speaker 4:          00:36:14       You got to have it on. And so he, I said, okay, I'll just have the the fish then and I said it like that and he went, got it and walked away and I spent the next 40 minutes doing elaborate with lies at the table, ways that I was going to fuck with this guy and screw over this restaurant and take them down and make them pay and then ever of course every time he came over I'm just like, oh hey. Yeah, I'm perfectly nice left. A really nice tip. Ate the fish I didn't want but I was, you know, but God, I had great fantasies. I think I was going to put his body in a heat vent. It's, I think that's healthy. I do a lot of revenge. Found a sizing, most of them. Just to wrap, just to wrap that up, I do think then you could do well on survivor because I think that you do have that side of you, which is what I started by saying, which is that you're not just like Super Mr.

Speaker 4:          00:37:09       Nice all the time. You have another side can ask him the question. Have you guys ever watching naked and afraid? Could you do nick, could you go on? Could either of you go on naked and afraid? Wait a minute. You're in the woods with coyotes and butterflies watching you doing it? Like animals, like bugs crawling up your badge. No, no. The vantage bugs are definitely, we're going to look in the car. I didn't know. You know what I have to, I have a book of insects at home. I will look up the Vage bug. I'm not familiar with it. Are not down with, there's some things that I love watching it. I think those people deserve like commit it. They're like hardcore survival survival us. Yeah, but it's a really weird I, the thing that I can't do is I grew up in the east coast. I spent a lot of time traipsing around the woods and stuff and I was sent off to camp bugs.

Speaker 4:          00:38:04       It's the thing I love about Los Angeles. There's no box. There's no bugs. Seemed to be no bags anywhere, right? Yes. For frankly, I can't wait if that's the price we pay for it, if it means global warming and the extinction of our species all, I'm all for it, but, but I don't like the bugs in our naked and afraid. The idea of being naked and being constantly attacked by bugs, all manner of, of uncertainty I would like about it is you know, learning all the crazy tricks that they have to like build shelters and you know, they magically can kind of solve any problem with their, the wherewithal that they've garnered over the years is survivalists. I find that fascinating, but they're naked. It's so fun and afraid and afraid and I'm always afraid when I'm naked. It's very, it is actually, you're afraid to be me naked. I want to be on the show. Afraid to be naked.

Speaker 4:          00:39:01       She just huddled in a corner and refuse to take up your clothes. You're not even in the wild. You're in your comfortable home. You're in your bedroom and my bedroom and I'm fully clothed, but the producers off cameras sync, please. You've got to take off your clothes, and I'm desperately trying, but at the end I always, when hundreds of thousands of dollars a month, you naked with a naked woman who wasn't me. You had not. Nick is the most, he's the least likely man that I ever have known to not ever even look at another woman. It's kind of, it's so strange, man. Who wouldn't not. So I don't know how that, I have no idea what nick around a naked woman who's not you. What? Nick would be incredibly embarrassed and wouldn't know what to do or where to put his eyeballs are a three piece suit out of Cherry Wood.

Speaker 4:          00:40:08       Beautiful Mahogany. He's not a cheater or he's not. He doesn't ever even look at. It's weird. Look at other women doesn't do that. That's nice. I think I would overcompensate in some way I would try to, do you know what I mean? I do a lot of shtick about them being naked and me being naked, but all the while just humiliating myself. I think it's best that I not go on naked and afraid. Do not go on naked and afraid. I think so. I think none of us are going on it now. It's out. I've been invited. Here's the thing, here's really what it comes down to. Megan and I have a two week rule. Whenever apart for more than two weeks, I'm suspending it for this cause I really want to watch it.

Speaker 4:          00:41:02       When you go on survivor, whether you're the first person kicked off or the, the the winner, everyone has to stay for six weeks because you can't, the world's can't know who goes home, goes home. So if they wouldn't let me visit him, he got kicked off after four weeks. But you know what, you could, I mean, first of all lies. And I would come and stay at your place. I love your house. We'd stay there. You don't seem thrilled, but I'm, I am thrilled. This is, no, that's not what I'm getting at all. And I read faces. But anyway, I would make it my business to be around and protecting you and uh, being a good friend to you and you, uh, you wouldn't even miss this guy. Oh, you'd be so many laughs. So many good times for survivor is such that this would be the one and only exception I would make to our two week rule. And I read it and I'd have my wife and I have a two week rule, but ours is every two weeks. She wants me to go away for eight weeks capitalist. It's a little different than what you guys do, but it's kept us together. That's good. I'm, I'm glad that you would suspend that. I would have allowed that. You would do that if we did that

Speaker 2:          00:42:20       and I agreed to it. Uh, there's uh, there's eventually on the show, um, late in the game weeks in, they bring in loved ones of the contestants and quite often when the loved one is revealed and they, they run in class with each other, it could be a spouse or a parent or a sibling. They, there's a lot of sobbing and an incredible emotional upheaval. I would fall on the ground and cry my eyes out because I don't, I dunno if I could be away from you for six weeks.

Speaker 4:          00:42:58       That's a really sweet moment. Start making love to coconuts, which you could probably fashion so that it's probably more pleasurable.

Speaker 2:          00:43:07       Well listen, I've done a little reading on this and if you're gonna, if you're gonna make love to a Mellon Mellon's in his past, let's just leave it at that. Obviously you need to bore a hole, but the thing you might not realize is you want to champ for it though. That's my question. I'm guessing hopefully your pocket knife. So what would you do to the whole, you gotta know you got a Chamfer, the edge of that whole cause there Ryan is sharp and it will really chafe. Yes. This is just something I've read up on and if it's a cantaloupe and you can warm it up for a couple of minutes, how you do that microwave won't be sorry. A couple of minutes in the microwave.

Speaker 4:          00:43:46       And then you've got chamfered edges and then do you, how long can you keep them knowing around? Come on last. Well can you draw this for me? Yeah, I can. I mean there, it's kind of a one. I'm about to hit the road. I'm just about to go. Do a tour and I'm going to be alone. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of despoiled well travel with um, this took a turn and you know what? Mostly usually I would say I didn't expect that but when you to for the melon is very touching. We are both, we are gentlemen and we are chivalrous and

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       uh, you know, treat that melon. Wow. The point is I would say to any other guests, I didn't see it going this way when you walked in. Only I did see it going in this way when both of you walked in because you are a sex depraved animalistic. Sensualists yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:44:52       I think nothing, uh, you know ravish each other nightly and uh, it sickens me. I think it's wrong. I think it's evil. No, that's your problem.

Speaker 3:          00:45:04       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:45:05       Get it on. But yeah, you know what, you two are welcome to do it here. No one can see you. There'll be some sounds in the background, but I can hum to cover those sounds. Can you see him from where you are? Cause yeah, you look really handsome. Yeah, you did really good. Hang on. Did you have some work done? Uh, he, uh, I got work done. I wish I'd paid more for it. I like cheap. Oh, well then it looks, I mean, you get what you pay for. That's the problem. It's a place that said you're in and out in an hour and yeah, they don't use anesthesia and they say they do take, uh, they take bonded checks. And uh, so I went there and I said, just let's pull back the cheeks. And it got infected. An old melons. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       They sack over your shoulder to shoulder. I've used melon. Is that what you said? Yeah, if they'd been despoiled by a celebrity that you can actually sell them on Ebay. Do you want it? We want some melon. A melon that nick Offerman. Fuck. And then you watch the bidding go crazy. Uh, I apologize to everyone. All right Nigga. Mohali Nick Offerman, there's no greater couple, uh, in the history of the world. We wish you all the best. Bye. Bye. Thank you. And now it's time for a segment called Conan O'Brien pays off the mortgage on his beach house.

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       I built my life around my hair. You did. You know what I mean? It's a trademark. It's a trademark. I started, you know, my hair is a big part of my confidence, my personality. If I lost my hair tomorrow, I'd I quickly buy like an old Lucille ball wig and put it on from the Lucille ball state. Okay. No one would notice. No, probably not. It would look the same. But so Harris say it's important to people's confidence to their sense of self. And um, that's why I uh, I was going to mention hair club. Hair club's the leader in total hair solutions. You know, they have a legacy of success for over 40 years. Who's been in the hair business for 40 years? Yeah, I know buddy. I remember those commercials from when I was young. Hair club. Yeah. I'm not just a member. I'm the president.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       Right. Sy Sperling. Just him. Is that who it was? I think it was, I don't think we're probably, he's not here on the ad copy, so maybe we're not supposed to mention him anymore. Oh, I'm sorry. And who even knows if this is the same either. They'd been bought out in CISE Berlin is, maybe there's legal stuff. Who even knows we've wandered into a total weird area here. I'm sorry. I, yeah, I didn't expect you to know that guy. Ah, yeah, I remember those commercials really well. I wrote to his fan club. I ended up hanging out with them. Uh, I was a groupie in the sites of early gang for a while. It's cool. Anyway, you know, people that are looking to regrow hair or revitalize their hair if they got any kind of hair problem. It sounds to me like hair clubs, the place for you, don't you think?

Speaker 1:          00:48:12       No, I don't have personal experience with losing all my hair. But it could happen at any time. Yeah. You're a guy. Guys lose their hair. You know what? Not if they have a low testosterone that's a guys with high testosterone tend to lose all their hair. I was very wisely opted for low testosterone. You opted for low testosterone. Yes. Done. Everything I could to keep my testosterone is low as possible in my life so that I can hang onto my hair. Um, you did it. I did it. I kept my hair and my voice still hasn't dropped. But anyway, why dwell on the negative when I should? Well, on the positive, if I were to lose my hair, I'd go to hair club. I really would, um, or just leave the country. But anyway, they seem to know what they're talking about. They've been in the business longer than anybody.

Speaker 1:          00:48:57       And we know women lose their hair too. That's true. It's not just for men. That's right. It isn't just for men. If women lose their hair also, you don't think of women losing their hair, but uh, but they do, they do lose their hair as well. It happens more to men because of the testosterone. But that's why it's less frequent for women or people like me with low testosterone to lose their hair. Your group did with women? No. Let's just let that go. So if you're struggling with hair loss, if that's a problem for you, go to a hair club. Maybe they're the solution, you know, give him a shot. Go to hair club.com/conan today for a free hair analysis and a free take home hair care kit. What do you think is in that? The haircare kit?

Speaker 1:          00:50:16       This is Matt. I believe in the beginning you said you might be ambivalent and you were a bit more positive after this conversation. What are the prospects of continuing this friendship? Do you think we were

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       justing when we said ambivalent and by we, I mean nick. That's right. And we love Conan. I mean Matt Madly. And so I think everything has had a very, very, very happy beginning, middle, and end. Very nice. I noticed you two were holding hands almost the entire time too. That was very heartwarming. We like each other. It's a habit. It's a nice habit. Yeah. If you could hold hands with her, wouldn't you? I sure of what that was like a like a kind of [inaudible] sort of reaching. That was very sweet. Thank you guys for doing this. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          00:51:05       Oh,

Speaker 4:          00:51:10       so Conan. I always do that. You know I'm in the room. I'm sitting eight inches from you. You acted like you were in a well and you fell into the darkness and you're wondering if I'm out there somewhere and right here. Okay. Conan. Yeah. The reviews are in for this podcast we're doing. We're doing well. We're doing well here. Your podcast has five star ratings, which is great. Five star out of how many stars out of five I didn't know that was out of five. Yeah, I thought that was out of 10 that's exactly where my mind goes. Oh, okay. That's just the way I've been raided by most people in relationships that I've been in. Five out of five. That's, that's cool. Yeah. Okay. So far so good. That's great. That's great. What's, what are the, what are the people out there thinking? I want to know what they're thinking.

Speaker 4:          00:51:56       Well, we're going to read some reviews. Okay. All right. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna read some, yeah, yeah. Keep saying you're going to do it. But if you were a pitcher in baseball and you're on the mine, you're like gonna Pitch Pretty soon. Gun to pitch the ball gun, a pitch the ball. And you never did a Nav. Omar give you five stars and their review is, it's not bad. What? Yeah, it's not bad. And he's, and he gave me five stars out of five. Yes. So wait, that guy goes in to an RBS and has a perfectly mediocre sandwich and says, Eh, it was edible. Five out of five. He's, man, he's just handing out FiveStars left and right. Not Bad. How about life changing? So the FiveStars is FiveStars is there. Well, if you're going to write something after five stars, right? I now see what life is all about.

Speaker 4:          00:52:50       Thank you. Thank you. Conan. Don't right. Not Bad. What? Sue, sue, ed, Sua dubs. Sue dubbs. No, sue dubs. I was reading that wrong. Sue Dubs said your podcast makes me want to give you a hug. Oh, it's sweet. Is it though or is it that she feels sorry for me? It could be she feels sorry for you. It could be, oh, I listened to him and I just want to give him a hug. But I will also say when I was single, pity was the motivating force behind most of the women. They had hooked up with me. So pity is my friend. I think she may pity me, but that's okay. It doesn't matter. That's something to brag about. Pity. Pity was pity was my wing man. That should be the name of my autobiography. Pity was my wing man by Conan O'brien. I would, I'd like to hug her as well.

Speaker 4:          00:53:46       As long as it was all monitored and was done. Um, you know, appropriately it can match what? Achy. Madge, icky, Madge I, these are all screaming what's going on? He can match, right? He's a ginger. Gingers are people too. Dot. Dot. Dot. Question Mark. Oh my God, this is brutal. And we're a very well reviewed podcast and these are the happy comments. Yeah, I'm a ginger. All right. And Ginger are people to Ginger's I should have made that plural. It ginger are people do, apparently we're not, we can't even speak correctly. Uh, yes. You know gingers are, we are the one group that everyone feels comfortable making fun of. You know what I mean? Like it, think about it in this age of extreme sensitivity. You couldn't make that comment about any other kind of person by the freckles. Why would you focus on those?

Speaker 4:          00:54:50       I have a lot of freckles. You know, a lot of them don't show up on camera on TV. Of course they put makeup on. But, um, my hands have a ton of freckles. My, my hands look, uh, they just look crazy. They've got so many, right? You've seen my hands when I come back from like a Caribbean island, I looked like a mummy that just crawled it's way out of the tomb. I was surprised when I met you for the first time. Oh my God. It speaks quarterly. What are you talking about? You were surprised the amount of freckles. You didn't think I'd have that many know. What else surprised you? Be Honest. Guide the hightest. Uh, people don't think I'm not tall. Your presence is commanding. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, you can't see this right now. But Gourley is saluting me. Uh, he is saluting me, uh, the way they do in the navy.

Speaker 4:          00:55:37       Uh, so that, so really seriously my height and then freckles on my face or just in general. I'm only joking, but yeah, you don't see them on TV. You don't see him on TV. They're actually becoming cause it, it kind of, it's a part of you. Yes. It makes me more human. They look good. Well thank you. Yeah. Let me take it easy, pal. Yeah, I'll back off now. Yeah, I'll cut this. No, no, no. I like this. You want me to keep the one positive thing we've really heard about me. Oh, but three stars. Sorry. Yeah, I get growly when he met me, gave me three stars from my physical appearance, but he does like the podcast, so, and he got that going. It was nice to him to be cut in and say, that was nice. I, I hope he doesn't cut that out or I don't know. You don't care. I know. I don't know. Read another one. Let's keep the sound. All right. Let's, do you have trouble reading? No, I'm just trying to choose ones. Oh, by Matt. Matt. Matt. To near the end of life. It's important to record your voice so that the family can listen back and remember you fondly.

Speaker 4:          00:56:39       You think some at the end of my life, maybe he knows something that I don't know. Eerie. Isn't that eerie? I won't see. Think I am. I'm not that old. What was that? Some kind of veiled threat? I hope so. You hope so. Yeah. It gets my name in the papers. You know, the important thing is I always say that when I don't know what I'm saying. Next important thing is I do believe he's correct that the recorded voice is important and I'm going to say something else. Hmm. This is me just freewheeling here. People's last words used to be very important and they talked about it a lot. Do you know like with one of the founding fathers was on his deathbed, he'd say the republic still stands and then he would die. You know? Is that real? Did someone say that? I think people said things like that. People used to say things like, and now I go to my rest and then they would die. Stonewall Jackson famously when he was mortally wounded, his last words were take me over the river and into the trees. Oh, beautiful. And then he passed away and I was thinking about it. There aren't last words anymore because they keep us going forever and we're all hooked up. We have tubes in our mouth and stuff at the end. So when I last words are like, Oh, oh,

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       do you know what I mean? I mean, I'm not trying to be funny. I'm not trying to make you laugh. You know, Picasso wasn't always trying to make great art. Sometimes he was just scribbling on a Napkin. But my point is that there are no last words anymore because someone probably says something really profound. Like one of my time comes, I'm going to try and say something profound and I'm going to say something like, and now let us to the other world and to the light, but then a nurse is going to come in and go, nope, we can keep him going for another year and inject all this shit into me and then jam a tube in my throat and then I got to spend a year going. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:58:34       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       they're going to say, what were his last words? He said something kind of profound a year ago. We'll wait. We'll wait. What was that? I don't remember. It was a year ago. What did he say? Just before he died? Well, those were his last words.

Speaker 4:          00:58:53       I think something's been lost. Yeah.

Hello from the magic tavern, a chat show I host from the magical land of food with my cohost use at all the blue wizard and chuck the shape shifter most weeks we interview adventurers, ambulatory trees. We have a special episode. I am so excited to learn about the earth law contained in pride and prejudice. We're going to do a book club up pride and prejudice, and you said this is a world of book on Earth, right? Yeah. It's one of those books that people love or were forced to read or more likely. It's one of those I'm going to get to, it's and some of our most beloved of guests are a churning to read the book with us and enjoy some drinks and food. Have a book club. We are flower. We have chrome, the barbarian and girl. You know who they are. Maybe you don't give a crap about what an academic thinks about Jane Austin, but don't you want to know what a wizard and a badge or think about it. Not enough spells, not enough grubs, not enough sword fights. Whether you love pride and prejudice or have no interest in reading it and just want to listen to a book club going really off the rails. You'll enjoy this week's hello from the magic tavern. We shall defeat.
