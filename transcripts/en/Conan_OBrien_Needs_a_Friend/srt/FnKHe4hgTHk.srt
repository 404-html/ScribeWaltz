1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,220
Well, you wanted it and it's back.
That's right. Palm is back on Verizon.

2
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,860
What's Palm you say? I mean,
I didn't hear you say that,

3
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,160
but I'm guessing you said what's
Palm? Well, let me tell you, palms,

4
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:18,450
a small practical companion device that
syncs with your existing smartphone.

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,070
It doesn't replace your smart phone,

6
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:23,310
but it connects to it so you can leave
your phone behind and then you can take

7
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:26,760
palm with you. So f you phone. I got palm.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,620
I think that's the idea of palm.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,210
Go to palm.com to learn
more because clearly I'm not
helping run to your nearest

10
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:37,920
Verizon store to check out
palm for yourself and say
to them, Conan explained it,

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,940
but not very well.

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,150
Hello,
my name is Wanda Sykes.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,233
Hmm.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,230
And I feel uh,

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,910
somewhat trapped about
being Conan O'brien's friend
because he's right here in

16
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:55,744
front of me.

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,540
Back to
school.

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,630
Hey there,
welcome to Conan O'brien needs a friend.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,370
This is a show where I Conan O'Brien.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,360
I talked to celebrities and
interesting personalities,

21
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,940
basically people I've had
on my show over the years.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,950
And I tried to see if we can become real
friends, not just on camera friends.

23
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,930
Um, aided in my quest by my
assistant sona. Hi. Hello. Hey Sona.

24
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,440
And now my producer Matt Gorley. Hi. Okay.

25
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:46,250
Today's guest is a comedian
who is brilliantly funny.

26
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:48,800
She's been coming on my
show for a very long time.

27
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,280
I love her Wanda Sykes.

28
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,360
Okay. So it sounds to me like you're not
doozy astic about the idea of being my

29
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:06,340
friend.
You're not sure how you feel about it.

30
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:09,550
You feel like this is a
contrived situation. Yes. Yes.

31
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,740
This isn't something that
would naturally come about.

32
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:15,760
Were you an IRF Froggert shop and we
bumped into each other. Right? Well,

33
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,570
you would never find me at a frozen
shop. So right there, you know,

34
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,470
absolutely nothing about me that's
Sydney would have said, oh, you know,

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,470
walked into this that we were in the same
bar or, right. Like Weirdos, dump junk.

36
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:32,980
It's that we have to do, yeah, we have to
get junk junk. It's old. And then if, say,

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,850
you know, we were at the, at the hotel
lounge or whatever, and at a bar,

38
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,260
that's more of it.

39
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:42,100
That's a situation that you could see
unfolding much more than I walk into a

40
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:46,630
frogger shop and you're there
having like a triple scoop cone,

41
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,100
right. With organic organic.
Know what, maybe if, if, if,

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,710
if I were with the kids, then you'll,
then you would catch me in a shot.

43
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,660
Yeah, I do. Maybe I know more
about you than you think I do.

44
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,530
Maybe. Maybe I knew you
have twins, you have twins.

45
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:10,330
That seems overwhelming to me. That
just was very, very overwhelming.

46
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,500
I mean, the, the first week I
really was thinking that, yeah,

47
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,770
I might have to take one
back. I know. I honestly,

48
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,180
I'm serious. I honestly
thought that, but I was like,

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,810
we have a boy and a girl and,

50
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,750
and I was just wondering which one would
my wife pick right to return. Right.

51
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,380
And uh, and then I was like, she's,
she's not going to be in on this.

52
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,590
I think I'm sold on this idea.

53
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:37,360
I don't think she would have gone
away with returning one. Nope.

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,280
Is the return policy. I don't even know.
That sounds crazy. They're gorgeous kids.

55
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,440
They're beautiful kids.
You know?

56
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,410
No one's stones were trained one hair.

57
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:51,540
I could've got a nice penny for one of
them. You thought about this, did you,

58
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,730
did you scout out what the prices are?

59
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,040
Inquiries.
I was pretty sure I can get six figures.

60
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,100
You know what? That's a great way
to say I love you too. A child.

61
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,890
I looked into it and you know,

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,340
worth six figures and
I kept you my mother.

63
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,450
I'm Irish Catholic, so big surprise
here. I'm one of six kids. Wow.

64
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,100
You fall in that line of sick. He, I
am in the middle now. A lot of people,

65
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,780
math nerds are like, how can you be
the middle of six? You don't care.

66
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,220
I don't care. But I'm the third from
the top and the third from the bottom.

67
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:33,960
So yeah, I think of myself as wait
for it from the, but that's not right.

68
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,610
Wait, that's wrong. That means
there's another kid in here somewhere.

69
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,090
The seventh he didn't make it.

70
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,940
We left him in the attic too long.

71
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,350
Supposed to crack a window anyway.
I,

72
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,180
I'm forced from the
bottom third from the top.

73
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,570
But my mom had a kid like every
six months. I don't know. Shit.

74
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,760
It's impossible. It's not. If you have
the Irish gene, you can have a child.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,250
You can have up to two
children a year. Wow. Yeah.

76
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,600
And so my mom had litters then.
It's craziness.

77
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,750
Neil was born in 61 [inaudible]
62 Conan 63 Kate 64.

78
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:16,380
Gene 67. What happened there?
They waited a few years.

79
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:21,150
Then Justin comes piling along right
after that. I, it's insanity and,

80
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:24,000
and uh, it was the wild west
in my house. No one was,

81
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,210
no one was paying attention to us.
Winning around.

82
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,130
Your kids are both being doused with
love. I bet all the time. They are pretty.

83
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,210
That's nice. They get a lot of
attention. I need to be reparented.

84
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,870
I'd like to come to your house and be
reparented by you and your wife if that's

85
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:43,620
possible or reparented.
I'd like you to be my painful.

86
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,400
You don't want to deal with me.
No one wants full,

87
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,640
no one wants to deal with
me and you're so tall.

88
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,900
That's puts a strain on my neck. Cause
now I'm always happy to, you know,

89
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,820
also just to be friends,

90
00:05:56,821 --> 00:06:01,821
you have to agree to it that we have
a lot of conversations and seed it.

91
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,740
I, I'm not going to be walking
around with your neck a neck.

92
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,720
What if I agreed to always be in a
wheelchair? Oh, that's even better.

93
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,480
One of those little scooter
ones. That's even, yeah.

94
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,880
You and I are walking down the
street eating frogger, a Wanda Sykes,

95
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:20,320
Conan O'brien and I'm in one of those
electric scooters and we have adventures

96
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:24,010
together. Yeah. Because what I've
noticed is that I've known you for years.

97
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:27,550
You came on my show very
early on, man. Yeah.

98
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,100
You were one of the people that came
on very early on in the show and uh,

99
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,440
we've known each other a long time and
I've always loved your comedy and I love

100
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:39,940
you as a person. I really do think you're
terrific and yet we're not friends.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,770
Real friends. Yeah. And I'm thinking,

102
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:45,310
and that happens a lot on my show where
I can really connect with people on the

103
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:49,990
TV show and then, uh, TV
shows over and buy and we hug.

104
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,500
Right.

105
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,710
And then you get in a big black SUV
and you're dripping away and that's it.

106
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,280
And I don't see you again unless this sun,
another work thing.

107
00:06:57,281 --> 00:07:01,020
G or so you only come on my show
to promote something? Um, no,

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,130
I've been on your show just to
like hang out again. Have to ask

109
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,360
some funny stuff to say.
Yeah, I'll go, I'll go.

110
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,430
But what I'm getting from this does,
you've never called the show and said, um,

111
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,460
you haven't called me and
I have nothing to promote,

112
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:19,570
but I just like to see Conan.
You've never done that? Nope.

113
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,930
Oh yes. It hotter in here. Good
Lord. What is going on? This is,

114
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,760
we're going to switch rooms
and this is, um, all right,

115
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,940
this is a former Brandon here.
Sweet Jesus.

116
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,960
We're making a Samurai Samurai Brad
in the back. It is warm in here. Yeah,

117
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,710
this isn't the best. Um, but we're
going to get a better place. Okay.

118
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,240
And so just chill and then you're
going to come back to the nicer place.

119
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,700
But when I come back, hopefully between
that time we would have, you know,

120
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:55,500
developed some type of a friendship.
I hope so.

121
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,420
It would maybe start with you
inviting me to your house. Yes.

122
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,670
That's a stretch, right? What do you,
what do you mean that's a stretch. Wow.

123
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,500
That is the really busy in
the most basic way. It takes

124
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,980
a while to get into the house. Since
the dawn of time, people have said,

125
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:17,210
come to my home.

126
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,450
That is how ancient people
showed friendship and
cordiality and I just suggest

127
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:28,420
it and you shut me down so fast,

128
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:32,120
but when you make it to my house and
I'm like, Hey, come over, you know,

129
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,060
hang out at my house.
That, that, that's like,

130
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,190
I'll help you had a body
friendship. Wow. Yeah. Okay.

131
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,340
That's a stretch for me right now.
Yeah. Right now we're still at the,

132
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:48,440
maybe just somewhere you'll
meet me in a neutral. Yeah.

133
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,550
Yeah. That's like your, that
goes well then it's like,
yeah, come on over man. Okay.

134
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,990
You just did. Basically, they always
tell someone who's meeting, uh,

135
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,600
you know,
a drug king pin meet in a public place.

136
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,440
So he can't tell you that's
how you're treating me.

137
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,650
You're treating me like
I'm a potential murderer.

138
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,410
Murderer. No, that's a
stretch. You know, we'll say,

139
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,120
well I'm just like, just getting
to know so one. Okay. Right.

140
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,880
Just make sure it's a public place where
there's a lot of people there do a lot

141
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:25,630
of people, but you want some people
there in case I, I start to flip out.

142
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,170
Other people were there to
restrain me physically. Yeah.

143
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,130
Yeah. We're going to be
really good friends. You know,

144
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,920
it's funny cause we just mentioned, I
just mentioned murderers. You and I,

145
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,870
and I've talked with
you about this before,

146
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,110
but we do share something in common that
we can talk about when we become real

147
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:47,360
friends. We both love murder, love,

148
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,530
murder shows you love them.
I love them. I love them.

149
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:55,220
To the point where I had to like take
a break from them because I was just,

150
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,400
you know, looking at
people as like, yeah bitch,

151
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,200
you probably got an body in this
trunk or really just poured.

152
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:08,120
Yeah. Or I'll look at couples and
I'll think like who's going to do it?

153
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,910
Who's going to kill those until yeah.
There and then,

154
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,320
and then cry on the local news and say,
I can't believe you can't. You can't,

155
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:19,730
you call it out. Now if someone goes
missing and if the spouse is on,

156
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,210
on the news, don't you know? Yes. You
can tell automatically right away. Yeah.

157
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,380
Right away.
I know from nine one one calls,

158
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,690
you can tell from a nine one one call.
Yup.

159
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,380
You can just listen to the timber
of their voice. And I go, oh man.

160
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,960
Yeah he did that. He said,
what is he talking about?

161
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,360
Cause he's usually forcing
it a little bit. Yeah.

162
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,440
Or given too much information. Yes. Yeah.

163
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,763
Oh

164
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:51,290
cause I was at Mcdonald's and I had,

165
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,110
and I have the receipt.

166
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,430
Did it, did it. That's so true. Yeah.

167
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,460
I watch every single murder
show and there's that show. Um,

168
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,510
is it investigative files? Uh, what does
that forensic files, forensic files.

169
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:30,860
Oh yeah. They take over a headline
news after a certain time. This is,

170
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:35,861
so what happens is I've stumbled upon
forensic files and I've watched maybe 18

171
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:41,411
in a row and I was upset
and I was supposed to like
pick up my son and I didn't.

172
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:48,850
And he's wandering in the woods alone
and I'm watching a show and I'm,

173
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,150
and I can't, I can't stop. I
can't stop it. And I'm just,

174
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm fascinated by those shows.

175
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,780
And I'm always fascinated by how many
people murder for the smallest thing.

176
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:06,250
Like he had some butterscotch candies and,

177
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:10,180
and his friend wanted three of them,
you know,

178
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,680
so he went in there and just blood and
hair on the walls and mean just to cry,

179
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,190
you know, and he leaves with two
butterscotch candies. I don't know.

180
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,931
I would,

181
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:24,931
I love murder so much that I have said
many times I would love to murder or even

182
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:30,820
be murdered if I was murdered.
I'd be honored. Isn't that weird?

183
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,660
Because I'd be like,
I made it into the club.

184
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm such a fan of murder that someone
murdered me. Yay. I made it out to murder.

185
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,840
Someone took the time to murder
me and now I get to be in the,

186
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:47,680
and now everyone gets to talk
about who did it. And uh,

187
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,210
it's probably a weird message to
put out there. It is. It is. Um,

188
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,310
we've talked about this a lot,

189
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,400
but I do think that you were in the best
named movie of all time and you know

190
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:03,040
what I'm talking about. You
can't get enough of it. I can't,

191
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,300
I can't get enough of it. Pootie Tang.
Yeah. Every time I'm on the show you,

192
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,710
the thing is,
it's been Pootie Tang and the thing is,

193
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,140
I don't know how long ago
that was now, Lord, that was
probably 18 years ago. Yeah.

194
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,680
2016 years ago.
Who knows?

195
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,410
Someone out there knows
exactly when it was. Yeah.

196
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,740
If I was interviewing you when you are
110 I would ask you about Pootie Tang and

197
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:33,580
it regardless of what else you would
done in your life. You know what I mean?

198
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:33,970
Yeah.

199
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,970
You could have just become the first
African American woman to be elected

200
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:44,890
president at the age of 110 years old.
And my first question to you would be,

201
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,690
let's talk about Pootie Tang

202
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,860
and then I'd be fired as an
investigative journalist. Yes. Yes.

203
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,670
Such a incredibly, yeah,
and it made me laugh though.

204
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,810
You'd lie. I would enjoy it if I can
make them laugh. That's all I want to do.

205
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,010
That's all I want to do. Do you
have a podcast? Cause if you don't,

206
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,400
you're the only person who does.
I don't have a podcast.

207
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,320
Would you like to have this one?
I'll give it to you.

208
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,550
It's so generous. Yeah,
they're not. It's really,

209
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,790
it's just a couple of microphones and some
guys I've ever met. I don't have them.

210
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,350
I'm happily going to give them to you.

211
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,050
They all come in one van
with all the equipment.

212
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,340
It really is like a dominoes
acme, like you can have, you know,

213
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,450
that's actually a good deal.

214
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,510
A good idea would be a company that you
call him up and within 30 minutes or

215
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:38,320
less they come up and they set up a
podcast and your house and then you do a

216
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:43,300
podcast and it is available
to automatically download
for all of your friends.

217
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,020
That's an idea. You could make some
money off of it and Matt would that work?

218
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,110
That's basically what you got here,
that that's already happened.

219
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,880
That's why it's so hot in here is
that we're in the back of a van.

220
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,620
Right back of a van. Yeah. But he's a nice
man. It's really not. It's really not.

221
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,190
It's mine. It's home.
Yeah. It's a nice fan.

222
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,020
I haven't seen shag carpet like this when
I got to sleep in it in quite awhile.

223
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,610
Carpet. Oh my God. But
you know what it is. Uh,

224
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,900
you probably get asked all the time
like people, cause you're funny,

225
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:15,140
you're great cats do podcasts,
do podcasts.

226
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:18,860
And I was getting asked all the
time to do podcasts. Then I thought,

227
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,650
I'm going to have a podcast just so I can,

228
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,850
that's my excuse to not do other
podcasts. Oh, I didn't think about that.

229
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,270
If you didn't want to come here today,
I could have just told you.

230
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:33,770
Coulda just said one of
them. I'm going to, no,

231
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:36,650
you don't have one. No,
everybody's got one.

232
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,270
Maybe that'll be my podcast and
basically all it is is it's your day.

233
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,080
You live in your life. You put no effort
into it. You were just might for the day.

234
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,000
Someone like this producer,

235
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:52,001
Matt chops it up into a podcast
and people listen to it.

236
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,130
They would,
people like you,

237
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,490
they would listen to it and then that's
your excuse for not doing a podcast.

238
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,340
It's your get out of jail free card.

239
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,100
All the podcasts that I got out of doing
because I'm doing this podcast. Yeah.

240
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,760
There's no awkward
conversation with Mark Marin,

241
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,260
dax shepard or Chazz Palminteri.

242
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,110
I mean literally everybody's got one

243
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,590
and now it's time for a segment called
Conan O'Brien pays off the mortgage on

244
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:27,950
his beach house. Yup. No reason
to get into this at length.

245
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,250
I have a mortgage on my beach house.
Got To pay it down.

246
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
So let's talk about erectile dysfunction.

247
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,490
It's a problem for a lot of guys.
Fortunately not me. I almost,

248
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,950
I think I have the opposite problem.
What I uh,

249
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,330
don't mean this to
sound creepy in any way,

250
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,260
but I am at attention 24 hours a day.

251
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,730
If it needs to stop right now,
please 24, seven, it's the worst.

252
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,900
It's a problem.
I've had to have most of my jeans altered.

253
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,820
Scientists are studying me to
find out how I'm able to do this.

254
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,630
A constant source of pain.
But anyway, for some men,

255
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:14,650
they have the opposite problem,

256
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:17,830
which is erectile dysfunction and they
don't want to talk about it and they

257
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:22,030
think, oh, I can fix this on my own. I
can buy some popsicle sticks or whatever.

258
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,120
You can't. Popsicle sticks
and glue do not work. Oh,

259
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,110
you're laughing a little too hard there.
SONA.

260
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,870
I don't know what you've experienced in
your life, but why me tell you something.

261
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,850
You need Roman in your life.

262
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:38,851
Romans a one stop shop where licensed
us physicians can diagnose erectile

263
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:41,590
dysfunction. And then he shipped
the medication right to your door.

264
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,090
If you don't have that embarrassing thing.

265
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,240
I've had to buy Sabz and ointments at the
drug store and it's tough because they

266
00:17:49,141 --> 00:17:50,070
recognize me.

267
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,990
I'm quite famous and I'm asking for
something that I wish I didn't have to ask

268
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,910
for.
I'm purchasing a,

269
00:17:56,911 --> 00:18:01,650
an adult diaper or something and I don't
wear them, not because I need them,

270
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:06,180
but for the comfort. And also they look
great. My wife thinks they're sexy,

271
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,040
but the point is, there's no waiting
rooms. There's no weird conversations.

Uh,

275
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,430
you have a little chat with a doctor and
then you get FDA approved Ed meds and

276
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:32,220
they're delivered right to your door. And
you know, it's nice. The package says,

277
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:36,860
not erectile dysfunction meds on it.
That subtle. I made that up, that dust.

278
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,680
That's not true. I really
need this ad to end. Okay.

what I let them use my
name and the Promo Code.

283
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,980
You know why I like me undies?
No,

284
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,960
it sounds like underwear that was named
by a pirate. That's why I love them.

285
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,510
I ain't got to me undies.
I'm wearing me undies.

286
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,440
I am and then the parents
like with micro modal fabric,

287
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,790
how the parent knows that the parent knows
all about cause they have micro modal

288
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,530
fabric.
That's what me undies has.

289
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,340
Plus as you know I'm always
wanting underwear that's
got different cuts for men

290
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:26,840
and women because we're built differently.
I'm actually,

291
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:31,330
I've been told I'm built a lot like a
woman but there are differences and they

292
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:34,750
just got a lot of cool stuff. Me undies,
they sent us a package. They did.

293
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,260
They came to the office to the day and
I tried on the me undies. Unfortunately,

294
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,650
I tried them on over my
jeans and that was a lawsuit,

295
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,360
but so they have a great
offer for my listeners.

296

First Time purchasers get 15% off and
free shipping when you purchase any me

297

298
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,320
I think it's past 1216 wow.
Okay.

299
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,740
Get yourself a time machine,

300
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,400

your order before Christmas.

301
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,030

late. God knows when they even run this.

302
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,490
All this Christmas stuff
is bullshit at this point.

303
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,420
If you're trying to get this for
Christmas, you fucked up big time.

That's right.
And if you've got a time machine,

305
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:19,660
you wouldn't go back and stop Lincoln
from getting shot at Ford's theater.

306
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,250
You'd go back in, order me undies
to make the Christmas deadline,

307
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,640
God. But anyway, it's a great underwear.

slash Conan

311
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,370
did it take you a long time to get
here today? Do you live close by?

312
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:45,550
Please tell me it was,
this was this close by.

313
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,100
My biggest fear in show is putting people

314
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,490
out.

315
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,490
I hate when I feel like I've taken someone
out of their day if I'm imposing on

316
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:56,350
them. That makes me
nuts. It makes me crazy.

317
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,250
I hope you at least got to
run some errands on the way
here or on the way back.

318
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,770
I said did would you do?
Um,

319
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,880
I stopped and picked up my kids
from the bowling alley. Your kids,

320
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,870
they're old enough to go to a bowling
alley alone. They were with the AU pair.

321
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,250
Okay, Annie, for a second. I thought you
just left them at the bowling alley. No,

322
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,360
you like don't just leave you like
duct tape his colon and come on

323
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,860
money around like that.
That's 12 figures.

324
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,790
I think that's how it works. Again,
that getting, I'm not good at the math.

325
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,370
When they do boulder,
they put the guards up on either side.

326
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,000
You have those little guard rails
come up. They do. I worry about those,

327
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,700
but when they bolt with me,
I make them put them down good.

328
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,530
Because my son, my first son, I
took him bullying those rails,

329
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:49,531
came up and he took the ball
and he whipped it and it
caremed off each 15 times

330
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,270
way down and then accidentally knocked
over a couple of pins and he looked at,

331
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:59,890
he turned and looked at me like I did it,
I did it daddy.

332
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,760
And I thought this generation is done.
They're done.

333
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:08,590
Before the [inaudible] started,
this kid, a Turkey could have,

334
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,750
could have nudged a ball and it would
have knocked down as many pins as my sons

335
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:16,480
did cause it just bounced
off. And he goes, look,

336
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:20,520
if elation and then what is this?
This no put,

337
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:24,770
put the rail in his day and if
you're going to throw, you know,

338
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,540
20 gutter balls in a row. So
bid, learn now, learn now. Yeah.

339
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,180
That's the generation was a generation
that understood that and they fought

340
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:37,330
world war two. Yup. Well they
actually started World War II.

341
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,870
They told him the greatest generation.
I think it's bullshit.

342
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,980
He started as much as they, when they made
a mess and they cleaned it up. Anyway,

343
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,540
that's going to get me in trouble.
Two broke out here. Is that like Bro,

344
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,990
cause listen, fight podcast,
he probably has a plaque cas,

345
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,070
I don't think he has a podcast. No, he's
carving a radio out of wood right now.

346
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:03,450
Our raw rolling or Rio.
Um,

347
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,880
we talked about pornography last time,
but I forget what we talked about.

348
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,010
They have no idea it was that your
son knew the term pornography from the

349
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:16,780
Simpsons. And my son came up to me,
said what's pornography? And I said,

350
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,850
well that good, why do you
know that? And he said,

351
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:21,190
cause I was watching an episode of
the Simpsons where they talk about

352
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,470
pornography and it's an
episode that you wrote.

353
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,040
And that was an awkward dad
moment for me because once you do,

354
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,060
I said that's a different Conan O'brien.
I'll go to your room.

355
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,800
I did. I said that I believe in the
old school. I bet. I bet. I bet.

356
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,640
Did you ever have your mouth washed
out with soap as a child? No, I did.

357
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,980
Oh my mouth washed out with soap.
If you got a woman to look after us,

358
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:51,440
who's from Prince Edward
Island and even Murphy,

359
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,580
she was old school and my parents weren't
in the house and I said some word that

360
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:56,480
wasn't supposed to say.

361
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,260
I remember she took me into
the bathroom and she put dial,

362
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,050
she wet some dial soap and in
and out of my mouth. And what?

363
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:06,710
I remembered that it caked on
the back of my teeth. Oh yeah.

364
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,600
That really turned out okay.
You did turn it around, right?

365
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,650
Why did you write at the
end of the question mark?

366
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,890
You turned it around and then
you said, right, you only meet,

367
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:20,330
you don't want me to your house. You
only meet me in a public place and okay.

368
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,510
And you said that you'd like other
people to be there in case size suddenly

369
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:28,400
become physically crazy.
You said you'd like to be murdered.

370
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,590
So I'm pretty sure that
all the things I've said,

371
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,590
you can just throw those out the
window and let's just start with,

372
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,950
you said you'd like to be Merck.
That's true.

373
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,780
That's pretty few creepy dude.
Totally one. That's creepy. You one.

374
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,650
Okay. I'm just, you looked around the
room like other enough people here. Yes.

375
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,670
You're fine. This isn't a trap.
This isn't a trick. Won a Europe.

376
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:57,060
You're allowed to leave at anytime.
Okay. Let me use it anytime.

377
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,690
Horrifying.
I think that this podcast,

378
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:04,520
we may end up only doing like two or
three of these because my effort to find a

379
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:09,110
real friend is it's a mirror that I'm
looking into. That's what I'm seeing.

380
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:13,340
I'm seeing myself and I don't like what
I see Wanda. I don't like what I see.

381
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:14,690
A very sad and needy man.

382
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,310
What are the things that you enjoy doing
that you like to travel or when like

383
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:22,540
when you'd take, take the show on
the road and I love doing that. Well,

384
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:26,750
do you travel outside of show? Yes. Yes.

385
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:30,690
I do enjoy traveling. I do enjoy
traveling. What do you like to go? Oh,

386
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,740
I see what you're doing now. It
is your podcast. I like this.

387
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,190
Where do we like to go? I like to
go. Uh, I love to go to Europe.

388
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:42,060
I love to see things that are a
lot older than I am. They call.

389
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:44,510
It calms me down.
When you see like a,

390
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,830
when you're in a building that's like
800 years old, I just think, oh yeah,

391
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,220
I don't matter. In a good way.
Not in a bad way. I think when,

392
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,260
when I'm in cities that have been
around when I'm in Jerusalem,

393
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,160
I just think, what am I worried
about? This has been here so long.

394
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,130
We're all here for such a short time.
Relax.

395
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:09,370
I get a great perspective and it lasts
for about 18 minutes and then I'm right

396
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:14,210
back into, I can't make more of
my TV shows and that's not enough.

397
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:17,360
I need a podcast.
I need even more than that.

398
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:20,750
I must have more and so
it's, it's tough. It's tough,

399
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:23,240
but I love the perspective you get from,
do you travel a lot?

400
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,210
Go to Europe often France,

401
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,080
and know my wife is French so it's
quite to be with someone who speaks the

402
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:33,350
language. I had to be a nice
trip for the three of us.

403
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,510
You,
your wife and me in France,

404
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,390
not hearing anything from you.

405
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,120
This is the longest silence on a podcast.

406
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,440
It has been recorded.
Thank yet

407
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,680
I could stay in a separate hotel,

408
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:55,080
but we would meet in the morning and
we would spend the day with each other.

409
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:03,260
Now you're just exhaling what
a barge cruise in France.

410
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:06,960
Yeah. You and cause you
can hop on and off. Yes.

411
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,870
And you go through the whole country.
You can get off,

412
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,540
grab a bike just so you can steal it,
but you can take any bike.

413
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:16,290
It's not a crime and crime. As long as
you put a loaf of bread in the basket,

414
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:20,440
it's not crime. A loaf of
bread in the basket. And if,

415
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,700
if you're going to be gone with
the bike for like over three hours,

416
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:28,440
you got to put a bra on. You know they
have, but they have it all worked out.

417
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,900
That's what's great. Are you going to
do that? You can take a barge cruise.

418
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,890
We were looking into that. All right,
well I'll look into it. I'll let you know.

419
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,600
I'm going to wait by the phone.
Okay. Until you call. All right.

420
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:43,650
And I will go with you and we will
travel on a barge going all the way to

421
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:44,221
France.

422
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:48,930
Maybe let's just start small like
like maybe go to Canada first.

423
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,010
You know like, Oh, I thought you
were in Montreal. Montreal is nice.

424
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,080
I thought you meant they
do go there and test it.

425
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,360
See if we, you know. Right.

426
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,820
I was thinking when you said start
small that we would stay in La.

427
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,350
There is an La River

428
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,310
and we could find a place,

429
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,230
a part of it that has some water and we
could probably go as far as like 50 or

430
00:28:13,231 --> 00:28:18,231
60 feet and then get out and spray paint
something on the tanks up there and

431
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:23,970
then all run in different directions.
But yes, I think you're right.

432
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:27,240
I think it's smart to test it out, test
it out and see if we're all copacetic.

433
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:29,190
We all get along. Yeah. Now I'm thinking,

434
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:32,220
oh we can just go down
to the all ball pawn,

435
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,930
you know and and grandpa croissant.
That's something I could do that.

436
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,740
Okay, let's try that first. Let's try
that first. We're going to do that.

437
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,400
You're not,

438
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,250
we're going to Wanda Sykes and I are
going to go to an all album palm.

439
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,440
Don't give him the address because which
one? Don't tell them which one. Right.

440
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,830
I don't want to see you get murdered.

441
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Well that's weird cause it's actually
what I'm dreaming of to actually have all

442
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,960
those guys standing around me and saying,
wonder what happened. That's cool.

443
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,910
Thank you so much. Thanks for
coming in. Have you sometimes,

444
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:10,690
right when you only one of your, your
uh, investigation, Discovery Ryan there,

445
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,150
flip over to bt and
watch some black murder.

446
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,550
Really drama. What? Wait a
minute. I know. I always,

447
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,610
I don't know why, how we segregate
murders. Somehow murder gets segregated.

448
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,210
But wait a minute.

449
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,930
How is the BC murder channel
different call a fatal attraction?

450
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,840
It's just black people getting murdered.
But how would,

451
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,830
how do you notice what's the, is there
a cultural difference in murdering this?

452
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:39,240
Usually infidelity. Infidelity.
Like you're not going to see on,

453
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,070
on the black murderer,
you know,

454
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,120
somebody killed their neighbor because
the dog wouldn't stop barking. Best. Yeah.

455
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:47,740
That's white murder.
Murder.

456
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,540
Also white people love to murder
each other over insurance policies.

457
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,050
Yes. And it's all, we don't
have it. And it's, and it's,

458
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,340
and it's always have show pilots
and it's always for an incredibly,

459
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:05,341
like there was an $800 deductible that
he managed to get by killing his wife in

460
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,250
a murder. That costume, $10,000
a, I'm going to do that.

461
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,210
I'm going to start watching because
as a country we need to come together.

462
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,340
So I pledged to now start watching murder
on the bet channel and I'm going to do

463
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:22,900
that.
It sounds like you think about that.

464
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,550
I'll tell you when we're at the
elbow pawn. Okay. That's a date date.

465
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,150
Something you didn't think I
could do it one is a tricky one,

466
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:34,450
but I did it when it's like,
thank you so much. Thank you.

467
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:39,550
A pleasure and honor and uh, I
hope to see you very, very soon

468
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,213
and silence.

469
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,453
Oh,

470
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,380
and now it's time for another installment
of Conan O'brien pays off the mortgage

471
00:30:54,381 --> 00:30:55,400
on his beach house.

472
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:05,630
Sony. You're aware that I've made some
questionable hiring decisions in the past.

473
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,710
Yes. You have. Would you consider
yourself one of those? No,

474
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,300
I would consider myself an
excellent hiring choice.

475
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,450
You were an excellent hiring choice.
How long have you worked for me?

476
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,070
Almost 10 years, right? You were great
assistant for a year. The thing is, um,

477
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,280
that's not nice.
No,

478
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,850
you were a great assistant and then
you are an even greater assistant.

479
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,030
There it is a nine.

480
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,640
I'm waiting for the joke
that inevitably follows.

481
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,810
You're terrific assistant. There was
no joke there. That was me being real.

482
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,650
I don't know what to do. Well, first
of all, you sure I'm being sincere.

483
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,560
I look in my eyes. What do
you see? Just pure evil.

484
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,730
Now you are a great hire,

485
00:31:43,731 --> 00:31:47,360
but you have to admit there was a
chance that I wouldn't have found you.

486
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:51,710
It was just pure luck, right? I
just found you, taught you English,

487
00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:55,130
brought you to this country.
It was like splash.

488
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,710
You were like the mermaid that
didn't know how to eat a lobster.

489
00:31:57,711 --> 00:32:00,280
Remember you taught me how to be a human.
Yes.

490
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:07,190
Oh, you love yourself. Oh God.

491
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,770
If I could give myself an award right now,
I would.

492
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,370
The point is you don't want to leave these
important hiring decisions to chance,

493
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:17,720
which is why zip recruiter comes to mind.
I don't know why it comes to mind,

494
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,560
might be this piece of paper and in
front of me that says ZipRecruiter

495
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,210
read verbatim,

496
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,760
but ZipRecruiter comes to mind
because they find candidates for you.

497
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,480
That's what they do.
They find uh,

498
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,710
qualified candidates for you. They
have this powerful matching technology.

499
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,290
Ziprecruiter was rated number
one by employers in the US.

500
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,790
That's a true fat cause.
It's on this piece of paper.

501
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,540
And so when I go to zip recruiter,
now Sona,

502
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:51,380
God forbid I ever have to
replace you in a month. What?

503
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,800
But in a month I'll use
zip recruiter in a month.

504
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,480
I'm saying God forbid,
but you're seeing a specific timeline.

505
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,280
It's more like five weeks. I feel as
though you have planned something.

506
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,173
I have not,

507
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:10,660
but I've found ZipRecruiter to be
excellent at finding your replacement.

508
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,380
Should I ever need that person?
His name is Kyle.

509
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,200
I don't like Kyle. Well, he's terrific.

510
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,370
Thank you ZipRecruiter right now my
listeners can try ZipRecruiter for free,

511
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,190

514

And it says spelled out C. O.
N. A. N. This is humiliated.

515
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,420
That's zip recruiter.com/conan C o.

516
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:48,860
N. A. N. Ziprecruiter is
the smartest way to hire.

517
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,050
That's not their slogan.
That's when I just thought of that.

518
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:52,190
I'm giving to zip recruiter

519
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:01,640
one. Uh, one followup question, Wanda,
on a scale of basically one to 10,

520
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:04,580
10 being best,
what do you think are your chances or the,

521
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:06,450
the likelihood of being
friends with Conan.

522
00:34:06,451 --> 00:34:10,070
And after that discussion I would say,
and you can speak freely.

523
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:15,040
He's not in the room, right? Right.
Um, how would go and say like, uh, uh,

524
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:21,440
6.5 you feel safe with him? I
feel safe with him. Oh God, no.

525
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,690
Oh, I will have a weapon on me. Okay,
good. Alright. Yeah. So 6.5 with a weapon.

526
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:27,710
Well put that little asterisk,

527
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:31,460
6.5 with a weapon and then your weapon
of choice and he packing heat. Okay.

528
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:32,720
Thank you very much.

529
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,553
Huh?

530
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:42,500
Now it's time for Conan
gives a performance review.

531
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,380
Can I give a performance
review of how you just said,

532
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,010
now it's time for Conan to
give a performance review,

533
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,450
which I think is a better way to say
it then what you said. I'm impressed.

534
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:56,960
This is not your native language
and I'm an in very impressed.

535
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:01,010
It is actually my second language.
So yeah, this joke's on you.

536
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:07,050
I'm impressed that you note seven
languages. I know. Three. Okay.

537
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,150
How many do you know? Um, I am
impressed. I was saying I am impressed.

538
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,250
I only know five.
So good for you.

539
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,790
Now it's time for Conan to give
a performance review. All right.

540
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,800
I have a very good staff.
I want to start by saying that and uh,

541
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:25,270
but I think one of the reasons we have
such a good staff is that I'm, well,

542
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:27,320
I'm tough on them and uh,

543
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,150
I let them know when they've let me
down and uh, I also like to praise them.

544
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,440
So it's the whole rainbow of emotions,
but more putting down and praising.

545
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:38,340
I see the face from making, yeah. Today,

546
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:41,850
we're going to give a performance review
to someone who's been on my staff a

547
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:44,700
very long time. Aaron Blair. Erin,

548
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,640
what would you say is your title
on the show? I don't even know.

549
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:52,080
I don't know either. You're the web
guy. Yeah, I'll you when people ask,

550
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:55,560
I say web guy. You're a web guy. You
A, you've been with me a long time.

551
00:35:55,561 --> 00:36:00,340
Anyone who's watched my clueless gamers.
That's a Aaron [inaudible].

552
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,120
Aaron, you've been with the
show. How long? Oh my God.

553
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:08,121
I started as an intern in 2001 that you
started in 2001 you were a young kid at

554
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:12,720
the time. It's still gray hair
though. Yes. You've always
had, you've had gray hair.

555
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:17,250
You look like Newt Gingrich when you
were 14 years old. That's true. It is.

556
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:21,980
It's incredible. Yeah. You know, I
felt like I made it work. You know,

557
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:25,160
you do. You make it. I wasn't
criticizing you in any way.

558
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:28,430
I was just saying it was striking that
you had this gray hair and I thought,

559
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:32,600
oh my God, Newt Gingrich's walking
around the office. Oh wait, no.

560
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:37,310
That's a 14 year old boy. You
have completely gray hair. Yes.

561
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,620
Okay. And you'll have a
completely gray beard. Right?

562
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:45,310
But then it is colored dark brown,
right.

563
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:50,300
Your mustache and right.
Just below where your chin goes,

564
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:56,020
it looks like you're a gray haired
person who stuck his face into a bowl of

565
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:03,520
cocoa to take a sip.
So my question is,

566
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:08,590
are you coloring that part? No. Why would
I call her this part? Because it's so,

567
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:11,380
I don't understand how this is
color, the whole thing. Why? Who?

568
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:15,010
Why would I'm asking you? Well
know to answer your question. No,

569
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:17,680
I'm not coloring that part.
That's just what God has given me.

570
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,430
But so do you know what you're talking
about? That a little unusual looking,

571
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,740
doesn't it look like he dipped down? There
was some, there was a hole in the ice.

572
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:29,290
He was walking through the woods
with completely gray beard.

573
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,880
There was a hole in the ice.

574
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,450
He dipped down and saw a chocolate
stream running under the ice,

575
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,500
but the whole would only accommodate
an area slightly larger than his mouth.

576
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,150
So he dipped down to sip it and it got
his mustache and the bottom of his,

577
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,210
his chin get beards. So let's talk
about you and your performance.

578
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,930
You have done a lot. I'll go on. Uh,

579
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:55,110
on the record and play was one of
the first people to push me to, uh,

580
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:00,650
to expand my foolishness onto the
internet and to shoot silly little things.

581
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,610
And uh, and you do a spectacular
job. You want us, uh,

582
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:10,110
an Emmy for your work.
So you would think too,

583
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:14,900
I want to settle down power of saying,
okay, I've got one of those too. No,

584
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,480
I got you two of them. I know. All right.
Oh, you got them from me. Well, I'm,

585
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:22,960
you got me. I didn't. You
got me using your work.

586
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,250
Why don't you touch my work is
in the clay that you have get.

587
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:31,060
Oh my got you to Emmy. No,
I got you two. Don't get,

588
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,570
I, you hell do you think you are?
You've won yourself too mean.

589
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,880
What do you want us, what do you want
me to say? Yes. How about despite you,

590
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,160
this is going despite you.
I just want it just, man,

591
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:48,820
I was about to give you such a good
performance review when you know you're

592
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:51,550
doing an amazing job. And I,
and I do mean that sincerely.

593
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:54,490
I have a few notes for
you. Oh boy. You know,

594
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:59,491
I think that you sometimes on camera are
way too loud and Jess and you clap your

595
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:06,301
hands a lot and you act like you are
running a children's show and you yell and

596
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:11,791
we do a lot of live streams together and
you really are sometimes acting like a

597
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:18,340
circus performer who knows that
he has seconds to live if he,

598
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,650
if he doesn't, uh, amp up the energy is
just a little more. So I'm telling you to,

599
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,390
as you've got to calm down
just a little bit. Right. Okay.

600
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,670
You comfortable getting that feedback?
I mean it's,

601
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,600
you've given me this feedback quite a bit
and in public many times. Yes. So, uh,

602
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,240
now can I just say, I realize
I'm being loud. Can I explain,

603
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,140
you know what I'd never get, and this is
great, I never get the chance to explain,

604
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,330
I to not talk back to you,
but whatever.

605
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,480
The nice way to say that is I
explained my position. Okay.

606
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,630
And I'm glad we have this form so I
can do this because what happens is you

607
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:53,320
realize if this starts to go south on
me at any point that we'll cut this off.

608
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,660
I'm s I will, I'll just
shop and go ahead. Go ahead.

609
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,140
When we're doing a livestream or
something, my voice sounds crazy.

610
00:39:59,141 --> 00:40:01,890
You're yelling right? Cause
I'm very amped up. Okay.

611
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,540
They're adjusting dials all across
this building engineer's week. Yeah,

612
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,520
they're pulling levers.

613
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:10,060
It's like that scene where the Titanic's
just about to hit the iceberg and

614
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:10,400
they're,

615
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,400
they're turning giant wheels and they're
shoving huge levers into reverse to try

616
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:20,290
and veer us back into a normal
sonic level. But go ahead. Shouter

617
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:26,320
I uh, did a lot of choir when
I was younger I project. Okay.

618
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,250
Don't laugh at that. So I had
to turn away. Why is that funny?

619
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,920
Choir is a thing. You
know, he was the gray hair.

620
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,780
He was the gray haired boy
and the choir was tenor

621
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,880
second tenor. Yeah, that was the second,
second tenor here. It's like a time

622
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,120
and I'm just saying,

623
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:51,100
so I naturally project quite a
bit to do now to two live streams.

624
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,850
I feel like people are watching
on their phones very small.

625
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,640
You have to overcompensate really
to get it out. You know, look,

626
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:02,920
be like to do it right. So
bored. You're looking at me
with like dead eyes. No, I'm,

627
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,970
well first of all, I died
inside in a long time ago. Okay.

628
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,470
So I feel like I have to
overcompensate for that.

629
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,920
So I feel like that's what it takes.
It's all brute force.

630
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:14,980
I don't have your talents of being
hilarious, so I have to be just energetic.

631
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,250
I'm going to say you are a funny
fellow will second. And uh, I don't,

632
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:23,170
don't let yourself down.
That's my job. Not to put you
down a chocolate stream. Um,

633
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,290
I understand. And I also, I have
to say, I do appreciate that.

634
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:29,620
That always gives me something to start
with whenever we're doing something

635
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,980
right. And I come into a room and you're
doing a livestream and you're yelling,

636
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,690
that's the first thing I do.
And,

637
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:37,310
and it's so it's a little
like peanut butter and Jelly.

638
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:40,820
It works well together and then you punch
me for the next 20 minutes. I do it.

639
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,900
Here's another thing I do.

640
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:46,930
I punch a you often because you're a big
guy and you can take a punch just like

641
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:51,290
punch you a lot in the shoulder. Uh,
then your parents didn't like it.

642
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,680
That's true. He didn't like that
I was punching you. It's true.

643
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,510
And here's a negative performance
review for you. You commit.

644
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,290
You communicated that to me.

645
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,220
Now I think you should have
just kept that to yourself.

646
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:10,270
But I think you telling me that your
parents don't like it when I punched you,

647
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,890
I thought that was putting me in a very
uncomfortable emotional position as the

648
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:19,390
person punching
it was awesome.

649
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,400
This is the most ridiculous complaint.
I want to punch you,

650
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:26,600
but I don't want to hear any negative
comments from your family. Uh, well,

651
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:31,040
only what? My Dad didn't like it. My mom
says that like, do it more. She enjoys it.

652
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:35,130
Your mom likes it when they change.
She enjoys it. Yes. Uh, and I,

653
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:39,650
you want to explain to me, uh, that,
uh, coming from brothers very early on,

654
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:42,470
to your credit, you said, I'm
going to hit you quite a bit.

655
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,690
It's because I, it's because
I can't hit my brothers. Uh,

656
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:50,300
so I'm gonna hit you because
they're not within the arms.

657
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,630
Like there are certain writers that
I'm comfortable tackling fighting,

658
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,130
which is ridiculous and absurd. Yes. Um,

659
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,670
and I know that they're okay with it.
Yes. I think they're okay with it.

660
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:04,280
I may ask them someday if they're
okay with it. There was, there's one,

661
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,610
or particularly, I remember, uh,

662
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,960
I was either an internet just
started and I walked by and the old,

663
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,860
late night offices, he, he, he,

664
00:43:10,861 --> 00:43:14,960
you had been fighting and you've have
his head whose head? Michael Coleman,

665
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,340
his head we used to play with a lot. Uh,
Oh, you're holding it down on the desk.

666
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:22,710
And as I walked by, you go, hey, hey,
come here. Come here. I was like, yeah,

667
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,760
you go hold his head here.
Just hold it here.

668
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,840
And if I walked by and his head is not
on the thing and you're not holding it,

669
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,340
you're fired. I was like, oh my God.

670
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:34,370
And so I held it for like 30 seconds
and he goes, he's just kidding.

671
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,710
And I was like, oh. And I love
Michael Coleman, brilliant writer.

672
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:41,060
But he had that coming. I
love Michael Coleman, but a,

673
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:44,240
and I fully admit to that kind of madness.
I'm an insane person.

674
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,170
And he ripped your shirt. That's
why that happened. He, he,

675
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,630
they can't wear my shirt.
Enraged me. Yes. Uh,

676
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,060
let's move on to areas that
won't get me in legal trouble.

677
00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:00,400
Um,
you were ironic watches constantly.

678
00:44:00,401 --> 00:44:04,210
That's true. Every day you were at
different. Ironic watch just is true.

679
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,840
This is a negative part of
your performance review.

680
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,200
Sometimes you wear a watch where all the
numbers are scrambled or you'll wear a

681
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:15,070
watch that has no numbers or your war
where a watch that has no information but

682
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:18,990
just a pancake on it. That's true.
Yeah. This is my grandpa's watch. I, uh,

683
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,560
that's a real watch.
It's ironic.

684
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,440
It's strange that it's weird that I'm
bringing this up today because this is one

685
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:27,520
of the only times I've seen you wear a
watch that isn't made to look like a mini

686
00:44:27,521 --> 00:44:30,220
toilet seats or oh look,

687
00:44:30,221 --> 00:44:34,830
it's a steaming piece poop and it
stops steaming at 1230 limited.

688
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:38,700
We'll show you exactly what
is the watch thing. Uh,

689
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,910
I don't know. You know, I'm a wacky guy.

690
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:46,890
Never say that. Well,
you know, I mean, okay.

691
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:49,680
I'm not a wacky guy. I enjoy, uh,

692
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,160
I enjoy color and I enjoy, uh, I think,

693
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,650
I mean a psychologically is probably,
well,

694
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,820
you know what guys don't get to a word
jewelry, we don't get no, it's true.

695
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,120
And guys don't really get to dress
up like I, you know, it's like, oh,

696
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:05,130
you wear like a time we
didn't do when you're older.

697
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,580
I have appreciated dressing up a little
more as I am wearing a tie right now.

698
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,090
We can't. You are, and you look, that's
all, that's all I'm wearing. Your kid,

699
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,170
you can't think on its long.
Anyway, the point is, you know what?

700
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,320
So I wear to ironic watch because I want
somebody across the room to be able to

701
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,500
see, see the kind of person
I am from far away. Okay.

702
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,330
Here's the next part of
your performance review.

703
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,200
We're doing very well on the
Internet, don't you think?
I would say so, yes. Okay.

704
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,180
Why am I not much bigger on the Internet?
And I think in your huge, no, no, no, no.

705
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,140
I mean I think there's a
lot you must not be doing.

706
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:41,670
I want to be the ultimate because you
know, we're not a car Dashi and levels.

707
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,540
Okay. Okay. And you know what I'm going
to say, let's be honest. Let's be honest.

708
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:46,830
You know,
this is going to be great.

709
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:48,960
I can't wait to hear what
you're about to say. Well,

710
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,320
all I know is every time I
turn on SONA, jump in. When I,

711
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,380
when I turn on my phone or my computer,

712
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:59,220
I see what the Kardashians are up
to or who they're dating or hold it,

713
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:04,250
who threw shade at Black China
and who does Travis Scott and who,

714
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,980
uh, got a new butt and stuff like
that. And I'm thinking I've got a new,

715
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:12,810
but you know why? Why are, why
am I not part of that discussion?

716
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,260
Anybody and I think I blame,
go ahead.

717
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,980
They show their boobs a lot.
And you that's what I was going to say.

718
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,750
Do not use saying that they are considered
sexier than I am. More sexual. Uh,

719
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:29,550
yes, they are definitely
sexier. They have, you know,

720
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,280
very voluptuous bodies
and they show it off.

721
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:37,230
I mean if you show like you're but
more often and like a thong, be honest.

722
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:42,090
Be Honest. Tell them that I about my butt.
Tell them you don't seem to have one.

723
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,180
They have, there's nothing. There
is literally nothing there. Yeah,

724
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:50,730
but you know what? It is a straight drop.
I had a carpenter check it out. My blood.

725
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,960
Not only does it not go out, it
goes in. Oh you can, there's like a,

726
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:56,400
an area where you can,

727
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:00,150
there's just a big carved
out indentation there.

728
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,050
I can't keep pants on. Why did
a carpenter check out? You know,

729
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,220
can I say one of the best things?
Not best things.

730
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,150
One of the very popular things we
did was when you were jeggings,

731
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:15,840
you remember that? Yeah, I remember that.
Yeah. If you were some tight like to Sona,

732
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:18,780
say if you showed that off, even if
you've got nothing, here's the problem.

733
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:21,330
Show it off. You know, like
here's the thing. Why did you say,

734
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,660
even if he got nothing. Well,
I'm saying if you, well,

735
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,220
I dunno, I'm saying, I'm saying
maybe it should be a little sexier.

736
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,640
You know, it might be just come out
and you come out in a suit every day,

737
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,260
you know, try, try maybe the jacket, no
shirt. Gold goes well, I'm just throwing,

738
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:39,820
I'm just,
I'm just spit balling.

739
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:43,630
He seen my chest prefer not if you've
seen my chest would really like not to.

740
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:47,550
I look like someone I don't
want. My chest is uh, you know,

741
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,710
a sunken chest.
Um,

742
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:53,840
it's the chest of someone who's been in
the coal mines for many, many years. Yeah.

743
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,680
So I don't know if you showed it off.

744
00:47:56,681 --> 00:47:58,690
I guaranteed there is a
fetish for everything.

745
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:03,340
People would be into the sunken
chest, like Deron not, well,

746
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,810
they might not be the people you want,
but you know, sunken chest fetish.

747
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:11,800
Here's the good end of that.
You're in charge or uh, you know,

748
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:16,810
you are at the helm of my
web presence in many regards.

749
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,980
Why are you not figuring out a
way for me to break the Internet?

750
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:25,810
I think we've broken it. Guest is
doing well. What more do you want?

751
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,100
What would he be? Don't ever
ask me what more do I want more?

752
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,320
But would you want to be what
the head of a country like?

753
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:33,700
What are you looking
for out of the vendor?

754
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:38,701
When Kim Kardashian had that picture
that showed her opening champagne and the

755
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:41,800
stream of champagne was going up
in the air, do you remember that?

756
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:45,130
And then it made an ark in the air and
then it landed on her butt. Crack has a,

757
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,800
but you can't do that.
It goes straight to the floor.

758
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:52,720
You can't do this champagne on the buck.
You have nothing. Photoshop. Thank you.

759
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:57,550
She also shows off like on a
private plane and really fancy

760
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,100
leather chairs.

761
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:05,101
And here's my new book about the people
who live in bogs in 1910 and what they

762
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:10,840
ate. I took a, I took
a Selfie, to be fair,

763
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:15,210
I was in a on a u s air
flight that was fairly uh,

764
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:20,211
unoccupied and I took a self portrait
of me writing in my journal and I gave

765
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,670
that to,
to put on the Internet.

766
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,570
And then I waited for the
whole thing to blow up.

767
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:30,400
Remember US Air Flight? What is
that? Anytime. That's nothing.

768
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:34,000
Look where you were, you know you are
in business. You weren't even in first.

769
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,120
You know what? First costs on us,
but I'm just saying you weren't,

770
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:40,870
that's not like bling bling,
you know, life saying, but okay,

771
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:44,110
so you're saying I have to get on like
a southwest flight and be in the front?

772
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,520
Yeah. You should check in very
early for this point. You're misled.

773
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,870
He's missing them. You know what?
Here's what you need here. It's just,

774
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:55,510
it's the internet runs on everything
else. Its sex appeal. It's its popularity.

775
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,210
It's thrown at you. What was the last
time you threw shade at somebody?

776
00:49:58,211 --> 00:50:02,200
So and don't you think he should start
a feud? Well, you need is, you need it.

777
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,560
You need a beef. That's what
you, how about I go after taiga?

778
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,970
You don't know who taiga is.
You know, you keep saying,

779
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:14,260
I don't know who target is, but I will
tell you I have a lot of beef with Tyga.

780
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,890
Well, what about like, who's
somebody who you like? Well, Hey,

781
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:19,580
you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

782
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:23,540
like who's somebody who you
know a lot about don don't
beef with, no, no, don't be,

783
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,420
but what about if you beef with like a,

784
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,700
but somebody who you know a lot
about who's still alive, who's cool,

785
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:32,030
who's still alive? Yeah, like somebody
like I know like Taf. Do you have,

786
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:35,170
don't you have issues with Taft? Who's
the, you said still alive, but no,

787
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,500
I was saying mean you're the first person
you lift. You just listed as, no, no.

788
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:42,830
I mean what if I'm the first person
to have beef with a historical figure,

789
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,250
but they can't be. They can't be if,
no, but I think this is the, hold on,

790
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,470
just settle down. Here's the
problem with you. You don't think,

791
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,600
what if I get into a beef?
You know,

792
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:54,370
I can't get into beef with Tyga because
I don't know who would tag is all about

793
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,310
and I can't get into a beef with black
machina and you know what I mean? And,

794
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:01,880
and uh, you know, Kendrick Lamar
and all these different people,

795
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:04,070
I can't get into beef with
them because no one's going to,

796
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,830
they're not going to know who I am.
It's the whole thing's not going to work.

797
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,720
But what if I'm the first person who
starts to have legitimate beef with,

798
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,430
you know, I've got a beef
with Hamilton fish know fish.

799
00:51:16,431 --> 00:51:21,220
Exactly. Look it up. Everyone look
up Hamilton fish or look up, uh,

800
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:24,200
you know, Lsu route. I have beef with him.

801
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,520
He was in Theodore Roosevelt's
administration. No, I have,

802
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:33,830
I have beef with Czar Nicholas, you
know, or the people last czar of Russia.

803
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:36,680
I have may, you know, I have major,

804
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,380
he shouldn't have dissolved
the Duma then as ever.

805
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,270
Maybe the Russian revolution
wouldn't have happened.

806
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:43,400
I'm here in a future
segment for this podcast.

807
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:48,890
I know gold when I hear it and that
this blows up code because then we get

808
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:53,010
someone to start writing back to me.
Right. In the voice of that person. Right.

809
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,240
You know? Yeah. I just have a,

810
00:51:56,241 --> 00:52:00,210
I have major beef with
Hubert Humphrey. Yeah. Uh,

811
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,280
and then he has beef with me back.
I have major beef,

812
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:08,390
it's called major beef, but major
feat definitely called major beef.

813
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:14,140
I have major beef with Secretary
of State Seward from the Lincoln

814
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:15,660
Administration. No. Yeah.

815
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,400
I don't think he should have purchased
Alaska and I consider it Seward's folly.

816
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,730
And this is the kind of stuff that,
okay,

817
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,850
I know what you're all thinking moves
stupid. You would learn from my beef,

818
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,250
my beef would educate educational
beef. Yeah. It's educational beef.

819
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:35,780
We want to learn from your major
beef from my beef. Would you learn?

820
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:38,440
Yes. You would all learn
from my beef. Okay.

821
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,040
But would think man Conan,

822
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,440
secretary of state's Seward or really
getting into it and then kids will just,

823
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:47,630
because they're into beef,
start to know about,

824
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,530
maybe Seward shouldn't have bought
Alaska. It'll be so big. The Kardashians,

825
00:52:51,531 --> 00:52:52,910
we'll want to be on you and be like,
no,

826
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:57,500
you're not historically significant
enough. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. So I,

827
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,930
uh, we're going to do that
and that's going to blow up.

828
