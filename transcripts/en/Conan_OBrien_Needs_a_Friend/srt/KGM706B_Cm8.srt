1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,940
Hi,
my name is Pete Holmes

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,150
and I feel frustrated but honored
to be Conan O'brien's Fred.

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,283
Yeah.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,883
Ah,

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,680
back to school.

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,280
Hey there. Welcome to Conan O'brien
needs a friend. It's pretty simple.

7
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:44,820
This is the show where I Conan O'brien,
uh,

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,380
talk to people in the business,

9
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,380
a celebrities I've interviewed over
the years and trying to find out is it

10
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:53,830
possible we could be real friends,
not just fake show Biz pals.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,960
Now I'm aided in my quest by
my assistant for now sona.

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,280
[inaudible] hello. Come on Sony. You know,
you're with me for the long haul. Yeah.

13
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:06,730
But it's hard to really believe that when
you constantly keep talking about how

14
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:10,240
my time's limited.
You see that often?

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,380
I like to dangle that because I think
that will inspire you to greater heights.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,430
Do you think it's working? No, it is not.
No, I don't think so. Either. A Elsa,

17
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,650
someone who I give a shout out to my
producer, Matt Gorley. Matt, how are Ya?

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm good. And I think because
you don't threaten my job,

19
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:28,030
it makes me actually worried that
maybe it is a short tenure here. Yeah.

20
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,480
Your replacement is standing behind
you. Oh, his name is Phillip. Hi Phil.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,000
I call you Gourley a lot. I don't know why
you might not like that. You just fine.

22
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,970
Is it okay? I mean, he could call you
Matt. I have so many maps in my life,

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,520
but I only have one
Gourley I, yeah, I'm, I'm,

24
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:44,800
you're one Gourley I don't
like Matt Anyway. All right.

25
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:47,680
Gourley thanks for being here. You
do a great job. Well, that's nice.

26
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:50,310
I'm not sure that's true,
but uh, no, it's true. Okay.

27
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,580
I do think this podcast is doing very
well. You're probably a big part of that.

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,290
Uh, no, that's, this
is all you guys. Yeah,

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,670
I'm just putting it through filters
and shit. Okay. I think that's true.

30
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,420
[inaudible] Gourley is the magic spice.
He's the secret.

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,740
He's the colonel's secret recipe. We're
all holding hands right now. Oh No,

32
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:13,270
we're not. It would violate
somebody's hand. Right?

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,410
We were just told you're just
holding a severed hand. Oh my God.

34
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,450
Today I'm talking to someone.
Uh, have a lot of admiration for

35
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,543
Pete Holmes.
Oops.

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,560
What I'm liking about this so far.

37
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,980
You've been doing this a long time and
it's completely the way you and I would

38
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:40,330
talk. Yes. Uh, without
any interference, right.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,580
Without, uh, and, and the show.

40
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,200
Do you feel like when you do the show
that there's levels of interference?

41
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,520
Do you think that's getting close? Yeah.
Cause you're quite relaxed on the show.

42
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,020
Well,
I really appreciate it.

43
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,960
It's one of the great thrills of my life
that I've done your show enough times

44
00:02:55,961 --> 00:03:00,790
to be relaxed. Certainly the first time
I was, you know, Jimmy and my bridgies

45
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,450
trying to get some new freight and
new phrase is going, me and my, well,

46
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,010
there was a kid in my neighborhood,
Jimmy's,

47
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,620
how do we know that type
of narcissism I exhibit?

48
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:15,340
I make jokes that don't have any, I know
you don't know. How could you do that?

49
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,890
You just said, I'm Jimmy and
my bridges and I was like, wow,

50
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,040
I feel stupid because that's
clearly a classical reference,

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,720
a Shakespearean drama. And then it turns
out no, Jimmy from my neighborhood.

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,470
How could you not know that it's
all Baloney? It was just fun words.

53
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,570
My mom will do that though.
Oh wait.

54
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,930
Or I'll come like you and I will be
talking about the bread and won't be like,

55
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,980
Eh. The spreads pretty old and then the
waiter will come who wasn't privy to that

56
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,550
and she'll be like,
Laurie,

57
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,120
let's say we said the bread was
dry and then she's like the waiter.

58
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,220
I'll say to my mom, you want
some water? And she'll be like,

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,030
what am I the Brad to
him? I'm always like, mom,

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,660
he doesn't have the info. He doesn't
just a crazy person and was like,

61
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:55,210
what did I bread?

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,520
And then he calls an EMT and says,

63
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,430
women's having a stroke, a stroke.
This, no, let's not do stroke,

64
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:10,000
but it's too many people having
strokes. Really. Right. I don't know.

65
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,930
I'm going to keep doing them until
I have one. No, it is a funny Goto,

66
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,670
but I was going to say that a stroke
kind of sound like it's a stroke.

67
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:19,480
You stroke a cat. It's kind
of Nice. Nobody's like,
Hey, quit struggling my cat.

68
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,200
You stroke a cab or you stroke
your gentlemen lover. Okay.

69
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:23,840
Let me tell you something.

70
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,640
Give them a stroke if you're working
on a new honk and I sense that's what

71
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:31,840
you're doing. If you're gonna do
this stroke bit, stroke a cat,

72
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,120
what are you a stroke? A stroke. It
sound like such a nice thing. A Straw.

73
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,370
Oh my God, it is a Seinfeld
bit. You strong again. Hey,

74
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,350
I had a question on your boyfriend. This
is a bit I've wanted to do for awhile.

75
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,120
How are we? Great idea. It's a stroke
of genius. Yeah, I forced it. Yeah, no,

76
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,290
but she's the thing. Here's what,
here's a bit that I want to work on,

77
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,560
which is how are we going to know
when Jerry Seinfeld has Alzheimer's?

78
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,690
Holy cause.
He's going to come out on stage and go,

79
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,360
I just want to know who
all these people bad.

80
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,540
What is the deal with pizza?

81
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,700
And people are going to first
think that Jerry is working on,

82
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,970
they're going to think he's
working on new material.

83
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,070
No, sue, who are these big Cheri?

84
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,920
These are your loved
ones. Oh No, I'm scared.

85
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,860
I'm lost in the corridors of my own mind.

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,150
Who are these people?
Jerry. Jerry, calm down,

87
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,360
pump terrified,
everything around me.

88
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,150
What is this thing that,
that's a window. Jerry,

89
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,150
what does a window

90
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,500
and then it ends with it ends with you.

91
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,960
You see it's a window and then he
goes, that was a bit, no one was a bit,

92
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,990
you know Wednesday night I call those
playground bits where they're like you

93
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:48,050
have the premise,

94
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,280
you can do it forever but then no you
have to have that chord that you Paul and

95
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:55,820
then yeah I'm not telling you
what to do. I'm no, no period.

96
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,690
I just this my telling what to do or no,

97
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,400
I just did this 18 city tour and I have
this hump that I do up front and then I

98
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:05,330
thought of that on the road and working
it out in front of the comedians that

99
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,230
are like,
that's really funny.

100
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:09,520
But I never did it on stage cause I
thought I don't know yet. But I've,

101
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,070
but it might be because you don't, you
didn't know where the court is. Yeah.

102
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,150
The end.

103
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,530
I wonder if real like Vaudevillian Showbiz
is going to come back cause we're all

104
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:23,150
loose where the podcast generation of
comedy where it's like even your talk show

105
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:27,890
you can be transparent. People are
like we're seeing behind the curtain.

106
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,700
I wonder if the curtain is going to
make a comeback if our our kids kids are

107
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,100
going to be like it came out he
was partly, it's like John Malaney,

108
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:38,570
John Malania just does stand up. John's
not like, and that's how that one ends.

109
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:41,120
He doesn't, doesn't do
that. He is a throwback.

110
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,000
He is a throwback and that's
a high compliment. He is.

111
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,270
He's a very disciplined storyteller and
joke teller and he crafts his act in

112
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:55,850
this way. That's a little out of time
for today because, and again it's,

113
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,440
there are people that abuse the privilege.

114
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:00,800
There are comics that have their shit
together and then the ones that are very

115
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:04,220
brilliant but they,
they kind of wallow in,

116
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,400
I don't really know where this is going
and I am I really doing up here and

117
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,290
comment on everything and sometimes
it goes too far. Of course.

118
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,130
I think what we're talking about,
his podcast standup, it's like,

119
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:23,110
now that they know that we, we talk
about bits and these ways they left.

120
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,580
I can't speak for everybody, but
some audiences like it. You're like,

121
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:29,420
you go see Mark Marin who's, you know,
the pen ultimate. What does that mean?

122
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,810
Second to second to last?
I think he is.

123
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,180
Well now he is the next one. It's
over. Yeah, I meant the consummate.

124
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,950
Yeah. Podcast. Stand up. You know, he is
the Punam Bro. I know what you're saying.

125
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,820
It depends on person. He's Jimmy. And
is that just, yeah, he's the pneumatic.

126
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:50,600
I know what you're saying. Are
these the Paris, the populace? Uh,

127
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,580
I'm just going to say it like, Oh
God, how are we gonna you know,

128
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:57,350
this is a,
it's a disaster.

129
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,290
What I'm saying is when you watch him
80% of it, it's just like, I don't,

130
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,070
I don't know. You know,
like, and we love it.

131
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,040
Like that's what makes it
fun is that he's not doing,

132
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,560
because he's not supposed to be doing
what Malania is doing well and he's doing

133
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,750
what he's supposed to be doing, where
he's doing what he's supposed to be doing.

134
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,150
I do wonder if your kids,
kids will be like,

135
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,930
it came out from the cut and then he said,

136
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:17,660
well good evening ladies and gentlemen.
You know what I mean?

137
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:22,400
Like sitting at like lit up cocktail
tables and we just want to show up.

138
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,590
Be Nice.
Sometimes it is nice.

139
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm gonna add some professionalism to
this. We do have something in common.

140
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,890
We're both from the Boston
area. We're both tall. Yes.

141
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:36,770
We are both bedeviled by our fathers.

142
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,690
Aye.

143
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:46,170
Come on. I've met your dad. Your Dad's
quite the character Carlo. Right?

144
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,510
His mother. That's my dad. I know

145
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,860
Gregory and giving me some wins
your cookie 10 minutes later.

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,850
I never had a,
when Joe called me,

147
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,390
well this is the thing about your dad
used to do an impression of him and I

148
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,550
thought it was a cruel exactly.

149
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,170
And then I met him and it's really not.
That is an accurate,

150
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,850
were you a bystander and you were
describing him to police and you weren't

151
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,340
related to him?
That would be an accurate description.

152
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,480
A sloppy Peter Griffin type. When you,
when I had the talk show that you did,

153
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,890
my dad was that you gave me,

154
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,700
my dad was in the audience
and I was interviewing rob
Corddry. My Dad by the way,

155
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:37,380
wore a red sox jersey. Yup. Tivas
and he has like, I love my dad,

156
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:42,330
but he's got some fucked up feet.
His feet look like,

157
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,210
who like wouldn't start at
Luke Skywalker was in that pit,

158
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,190
that Jabba the Hutt but have
been in the monster, came out,

159
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,700
they looked like a rang Gore ran core.
Why would you even know her?

160
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,010
I oh good. I nerd in the corner. He's got
rang core feet and he, and he was like,

161
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,350
I'm going to put a legion Kiva,

162
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,860
so whatever's growing on him and can
get some air and you know, grow better.

163
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,840
So he's got these nibs, the mangled kind
of white old man Bostonian Tivo sang.

164
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,410
Kelly's tell me that he was in a war.
He was never in a war.

165
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,020
Never in a war. Convenient. A war
is the good out for everything.

166
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,370
I was in the war if you're out. Yup. But
no, he was his feet never saw action. No.

167
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,920
So why are they mad? Did they get
dropped into machinery? It's no,

168
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,110
they're just there. They grew weird.
He has what's called a hammer toe.

169
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,870
Not Mc,
not MC.

170
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,490
No one thought of MC and everyone
thought of Mc, not a person in this room.

171
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,970
So a you're saying is he's in
the audience, I'm sorry. Yeah,

172
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,610
he's in the audience and I'm
interviewing Rod, Rob Corddry.

173
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:45,180
He's also wearing cargo shorts.
So this is kind of thin chicken legs.

174
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:48,150
He's got like Shrek Body, Big Dad bought
it, I'm sure of chicken legs. Yup.

175
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,270
Ran core feet. You basically,
you know that game.

176
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,340
Where will you fold a piece of paper
three times and you draw the defeat and

177
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:58,710
then you've hold it and then
someone else not seeing the feet,

178
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,720
legs and then you pass it and then
someone else draws the, the, the,

179
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:06,150
the mid body and then the final person
draws the head and then you unfold it and

180
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:07,710
you all made a body together.

181
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,800
You're saying that your dad is
the product of that game. Exactly.

182
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,860
Somebody's got stoned and drew my dad
with five friends and so I'm interviewing

183
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:18,600
Rob Corddry, my dad, my mom
and my brother both dressed up.

184
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,110
My Dad's dressed like he's just leaving,
not even a baseball game,

185
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:26,210
like a batting cage. Like he was
hitting some balls and that we're,

186
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:29,730
I'm interviewing rob Corddry and I
hear him. It made the show. He goes,

187
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,320
who is this guy? Well, I'm
interviewing nothing rod ropes,

188
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,540
not t crews,
but I'm interviewing rob Gourdie.

189
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:41,130
I'm telling the people who carry
crews carry crew or Tom Cruise.

190
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:46,440
Okay. God, you abbreviate
everything. He, he was humiliating.

191
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,940
Rob Corddry, rob Corddry ran
with it to hilarious effect.

192
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,470
These clips are available on Youtube.

193
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,740
I'm here to plug the
clips of our old doctrine.

194
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,580
You know what they'll live on
forever. That's the beautiful
thing. Isn't that fun?

195
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,660
Well, what happens too is you've gone
on, you've had this other success.

196
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,010
People know you. Yeah. Well
established guys. So then they may say,

197
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:12,880
I liked this Pete Holmes and then they
start looking and then people start

198
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,860
posting. Yes, your talk show,

199
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:18,850
which was very funny and so I'm
sorry if it was very cool about it.

200
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:21,700
They gave us a hard drive with all of it.
They were very cool about it.

201
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:24,180
And then Jeff Ross, your
Jeff Ross. Yeah. Pretty Nice.

202
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,750
Watch that fucking hat.

203
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,780
You'll look like you're going to go mop
up a bowling alley in the 1930s when

204
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:34,920
Oprah Winfrey,
bro,

205
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,900
you look like fair

206
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,310
hang a six shooter from now.
Why?

207
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,380
Why Berg Comedian Jeffrey Ross
never has to do with set again

208
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,600
cause she can just play that with a tape
recorder and hold it near his mouth.

209
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,480
That was amazing because you think about
Cheryl comedian Jeffrey Ross a lot. No,

210
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:03,830
not often. Okay. Wow. It's
amazing. I have texted,

211
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,270
tried to text your producer Jeff Ross
and texted Jeff Ross and I've tried to

212
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,620
vice versa.
Jeff Ross,

213
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:13,490
my producer at shares a name with
comedian Jeff Ross and Jay for years.

214
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:18,110
Jeff Ross would get comedian Jeff Ross
mail all the time and vice versa. Yeah,

215
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,890
it's, I knew it wasn't
him cause he wasn't right.

216
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,090
You fat,
lesbian route.

217
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,240
Hello? [inaudible] this
is Jeff Ross. Yeah. Yeah.

218
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,550
My Jeff Ross, a producer of
our show. Not a fan of comedy.

219
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,790
Do you think that's possible? I
think it is. Yeah. I think he is.

220
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,690
He's a great producer. One of
the things, he is professional,

221
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:44,600
he's an amazing producer. He's the
only producer. Everyone I work with.

222
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,380
I suspect sometimes he is
not a fan of comedy. Yeah.

223
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,050
Cause I'll be making sense from, I think
some pretty funny stuff. He's like,

224
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,240
this is just wrap it up. Let's go this
route. Okay, enough kidding around.

225
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,120
And then with your jokes,
let's get on with the ponytail.
Enzyme. Yes, he is in his,

226
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,320
your this. He's the thing that helps us
digest that. Yeah. Does that make sense?

227
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,160
Yeah. So you take a porn producer
that is an Intersex, he's just like,

228
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,410
and then the breasts come out and
then the asas shimmering. Right.

229
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:12,380
And it wiggles a little bit because people
seem to like that. And then they, they,

230
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,710
he is a born producer
who's not that into sex.

231
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,450
That's the only way that I understand
that they liked the jiggling breasts.

232
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,990
Right. And that he just
studying. And in that analogy,

233
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,150
I am a male porn star with
a massive penis. Yes. Yes.

234
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,430
Who is very good at sac.

235
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,680
Maybe some say the best at sex ever.

236
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,820
And sometimes in a rough spot would
call an Andy rector to help him finish.

237
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,823
He's got a feather.

238
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,920
Hey Andy,
shut that fan.

239
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,743
Ah,

240
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,920
you've completely derailed my
podcasts and I regret happening.

241
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,280
You have not derailed anything. I, yeah.
You know, here's what I gonna say. I,

242
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,600
it's something I admire about
you, Pete. Can I call you? Pete

243
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,360
said, all right, you're always
insisting on Dr. Holmes.

244
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,050
That's my brother's wrap bruiser
name. Is that true? No fool.

245
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:12,410
And Dr. Holmes 33 wait,
your brothers, what?

246
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,400
My brother John Holmes make a joke.
Go ahead and make a joke. Nope.

247
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,190
My father also John Home. Yup. Uh,

248
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,410
is one of the things that he does is he
produces beats for underground rappers

249
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:27,710
are used to do it more. He might still
do it, but you can look them up. Dot.

250
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:31,170
He's a white guy from Boston. He's a
white man from Boston. Yes. Says yes.

251
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,180
And he produces beats for rappers. Yeah,
he's good at it. You know what he does?

252
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,120
I think so. From what I can tell,
it's a, it's certainly a hard,

253
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,170
hard game to get into now.
Is there anyone in your lineage?

254
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,090
It's got the comedy thing. My uncle
Larry was hilarious. It was super,

255
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:50,390
super funny and my mom and my dad are
funding, but now nobody, they're like,

256
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:54,350
if my dad comes home filthy and I think
he likes that he's got like an old

257
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:57,530
school like you can
child like my back hurts.

258
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,960
Like he thinks that's great
and my hands are so soft.

259
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,160
Could massage a seal and it'd be like
mommy. Right. I think it was his mother.

260
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,090
He knows you're a hard worker. He told
me that. That's the city. He said, uh,

261
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,760
he said, I'm not going to do
your dad's accent, but he said,

262
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,430
because it wouldn't sound
right. But he said, uh,

263
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,430
I'll tell you one thing about Pete, no
one that no one can out work them. Oh,

264
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:19,700
that's very sweet. He said that,
and he was telling and I was like,

265
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,830
stop talking to me about Pete.
I actually don't fully relate to that.

266
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,210
I wonder how you are. I think,
uh, I would, will you describe me?

267
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:33,560
So now my, I think I'm a hard worker.
You're a very hard worker. Yeah.

268
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,520
Conan O'brien can't stop.
And I'm very different from that.

269
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:40,080
And that's how we clashed
a lot. Sometimes it's, I,

270
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,080
it's not that I don't work hard, it's that
I don't, don't care as much as you do.

271
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:49,010
Right.
I care so much about everything and can't,

272
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:53,780
and then I get mad because I care so much
about everything and I wish I didn't.

273
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,680
And I try not to,
but then I still care so much.

274
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:00,920
And Sona has always been the voice
of, Eh, I didn't do it. Well,

275
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:03,710
why didn't you do it? Well, this is the
Internet. I didn't care and I'll be like,

276
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,800
Woah, what do you mean
you didn't care? Right.

277
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,850
That I think when I watched the
documentary, yeah. Ryan can't stop it.

278
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:12,110
It doesn't make me a little bit,

279
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:16,040
it makes me a little bit sad because I
see myself in it. You know what I mean?

280
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:21,041
That part of us that's always sort of
chasing the next thing or whatever.

281
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,190
But you know, there's also part of me
that's like, I think neither of us,

282
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,330
cause I relate more to that than to sona
wouldn't trade it. You know what I mean?

283
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:33,450
Like if you could turn it off as a
pill you could take right now. That's,

284
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,190
well that's the big question is
if there was a way to turn it off,

285
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:41,270
I would turn it off and then quickly
turn it back on again. You know? And uh,

286
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,900
so I'm always signing up for way too
much work then complaining that I have so

287
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,040
much work.
I remember you saying

288
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,920
that and that is like
when I'm making the show,

289
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:55,820
I want to be on vacation when I'm on
vacation. I missed making the shout out.

290
00:17:55,821 --> 00:18:00,680
Yeah. Oh Wow. That's a long time.
It's a terrible way to live your life.

291
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,860
I don't know if it is because it's
one of the cheaper fuels that runs the

292
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:09,480
machine and make no mistake that
work that sometimes we both dread has

293
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:12,390
incredible highs. Yeah.
He's incredible highs.

294
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,230
It's the addiction to the highs and the
lows. I think there's even a part of us,

295
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,790
I can speak from my experience that
enjoys when I'm like, oh you and said,

296
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,030
my job is putting my soul in the
wood chipper of show business.

297
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,440
And I think about that all the time. But
there's a, there's a, there's a beautiful,

298
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,980
it's almost like a French
like appreciation for like,

299
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,810
can you see what they make us
give? We kind of like it. Oh No.

300
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,620
That's the other thing too is that
they're not making us. That's right.

301
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,360
That's right. That's a
narrative. But comes back. Yeah.

302
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,840
To me is, um, there's this
moment of real clarity.

303
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,000
I think it's in the documentary,
which I haven't watched in years,

304
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:53,500
but there was this moment
where I come back stage,

305
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,370
I lay it on the screen.
Yeah.

306
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,380
I come backstage and I'm complaining
to my wife and I'm saying,

307
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:03,320
they make are making me do this
and they are making me do that.

308
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:07,400
And she said there is no they, there's
just, there's you, you're doing it.

309
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,110
And I realize that that's the,

310
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,780
the filmmaker who made that documentary
called it Conan O'brien can't stop.

311
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,940
And I,
when he told me that was the title,

312
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,820
I honestly didn't know what he
was talking about. Hilarious.

313
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,650
And then saw the documentary and it
was like, oh it's this, you know,

314
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:29,480
it's really strange to see
a mirror held up to you.

315
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,130
That's that accurate and not bad.
I'm not, I didn't think I was. Um,

316
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,580
but it was,
it was just interesting.

317
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,680
It's just interesting to
see the new England thing.

318
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:42,650
But maybe we were both probably raised,
I've thought about this.

319
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,950
You and I grew up in New England and it's
dark and cold in the morning and when

320
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:49,610
you go out to go to school,

321
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,440
the crappy car doesn't turn over
cause it's so cold and it's dark.

322
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,950
And my mom is making us say,
Hail Mary so that the car will turn over.

323
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,470
And she actually knew
the name of the saint.

324
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:02,630
You're supposed to pray
to WHO's good with cars,

325
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,500
which is ridiculous cause all the saints
existed 2000 years ago. But there's one,

326
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,010
there's like a saint Marcus or
something who's good with transmissions.

327
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,850
And my mom would make us pray to that
saint and then the car would slowly turn

328
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:20,510
over. And there's something
about growing up in it like that.

329
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,920
And I have thought to myself,

330
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:26,921
what if you could take a Pete Holmes in
a Conan O'brien and recast them so that

331
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:28,390
they're born,
uh,

332
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,180
in Santa Barbara and we serve,

333
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,800
we walked barefoot to school, we
walked barefoot, we, we chill,

334
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,190
there's a lot of wood. We, uh, we, we
maybe start smoking some weed like it,

335
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,980
is it possible that we
would be different people?

336
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:48,100
Like I always thought
if grew up in southern

337
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,060
California,

338
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,430
what I have had like a v shape torso in
a girlfriend when I was 14 and what I

339
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,430
have not had acne and what I
have just been this chill guy.

340
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,530
And what would I be doing now? I'd, I'd,

341
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,940
well I have pictures of me on the Cape
and I was like blond haired and I had a

342
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:08,440
10 like I don't Tan now. That goes a
little as felt. I've been soft ever since.

343
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,270
Like a svelte little boy. And I was
like, maybe that's California Pete.

344
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,520
But the question is, is California
peep funny? I don't know.

345
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:19,210
I could see you on Venice Boulevard.
Like not working out,

346
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,660
but maybe giving surf
lessons or something. No,

347
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,310
but I that wouldn't have worked either.
My center of gravity is way too hot.

348
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,610
I've got a disproportionate by all.
But,

349
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,460
but I have wondered
that is there's so much,

350
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:32,830
if there's a new England thing and
look at all the new England comics,

351
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:37,060
the real club comics. Yeah.
You know that it's so harsh.

352
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:41,080
I know you're really funny, but
it's, everything's fucked up.

353
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,590
It's a product of roads that were
designed for horse and buggy.

354
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,910
We had dinner one time around Christmas.
Yep. In downtown. But that's what I love.

355
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:52,360
That's a new Boston like a new, cause
that's not the Boston u and I grew up,

356
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:54,700
that's what I mean.
We didn't go downtown and that's right.

357
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:57,220
And eating a fancy restaurant.
When I was a kid, we went to,

358
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,490
we went to a place called Tony's Italian
villa on route nine and now I know that

359
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,110
is not an Italian restaurant,

360
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,240
but that's where we went and
we just got to have one soda.

361
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,260
And that was my brother
Neil always tricked me into
drinking mine really quickly.

362
00:22:14,261 --> 00:22:15,790
He'd go,
let's have a race and,

363
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,700
and then I would drink mine really
fast and he wouldn't drink his at all.

364
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:23,100
And then he'd laugh at me the rest of the
meal. Oh Jesus. If ever I love the me.

365
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:33,010
And now it's time for a segment called
Conan O'Brien pays off the mortgage on

366
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:36,100
his beach house. Yes. I believe
in being honest with people.

367
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,250
Took out a big mortgage than
borrowed against that mortgage.

368
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,380
Then borrowed against it
again, mistake. But uh,

369
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:47,020
I'm an adult and I'm going to pay down
that mortgage and we're going to take

370
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:48,400
care of that right now.

371
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,830
There's some hidden little
chip in us that makes us,

372
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,050
we know we don't consciously know it,

373
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,840
but subconsciously we know
we're not staying here. Yeah.

374
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,890
That's how I felt about Massachusetts and
a lot of my family stayed there when I

375
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:12,760
go home, I don't feel like, ah, Boston.
That's right. My old home, it doesn't,

376
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,000
I like Boston. I really love
Boston. I love the people there.

377
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,880
It doesn't feel like home. And in
fact, New York never felt like home.

378
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:21,220
I don't know where my home is.
I am totally with you.

379
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:23,140
I think there's a feeling of restlessness.

380
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:25,660
I said to my family were kind
of rough with each other,

381
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,910
so they came to see the fan.
It's loving,

382
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,970
but they came to see the baby and they're
just, they're just sort of a nightmare.

383
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,150
It's a nightmare situation.
I told the story on chemo,

384
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:37,600
but my mom came in and it was like,
the first thing she said was, uh,

385
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,900
we got you a book for Leila.
We got her a book,

386
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:44,530
but we left it in the diner in Pasadena.
Will you go get it?

387
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,640
And it was like fucking no.
Yeah, no. That's not a gift.

388
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:52,790
That's an errand we have a baby
supposed to like out. So anyway,

389
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,190
they're kind of nightmares.
And I said to them,

390
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,490
if there was show business in Hawaii, I'd
be in Hawaii. But you know what I mean?

391
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:00,380
I was like,
if I could go further,

392
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,200
but there's something that sounds
cruel and I don't, I don't care.

393
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:04,870
I could explain to you
how we love each other.

394
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,190
No, no, I understand that
you can, I want to go away.

395
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,960
I understand that you can love your
family and they can also drive you crazy.

396
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:16,410
I think we can all sona you can,
you can relate to that.

397
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,130
Gourley I don't know what your
situation is. Of course, of course.

398
00:24:20,131 --> 00:24:22,190
But I want you in this conversation.
Thanks.

399
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,880
You love your parents certainly and
your family really dearly. But you also,

400
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:30,990
uh, I mean you're routinely telling me
how much you also despise all of them off

401
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:34,230
Mike. Yeah, yeah. Off My, on a flow chart.

402
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,760
He's constantly writing notes
and pass them over to me during,

403
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,990
I despise slash love my family
and I'm like, you know what,

404
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:41,970
I'm trying to work here.
But you know, and my therapy

405
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,430
just hit me. He says,
Hey, your parents will,

406
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,460
which I think is what do you do it
intelligently and do it graciously and

407
00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:53,280
lovingly. That and there is a way to sort
of be like, yeah, I don't, I love you.

408
00:24:53,281 --> 00:24:55,200
That doesn't mean I like
everything about you.

409
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:00,620
Tell my, my wife is a
terrific, a terrific mom.

410
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:02,600
She's great. She's always, yeah,

411
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:07,160
she puts so much effort and thought and
love and to into being a mom and I'll

412
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,120
always remind her,

413
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,560
remember they're going to go to therapy
and they're going to complain about us.

414
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,080
Yeah,
we can do all,

415
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:17,860
we can base this Turkey with
love every five seconds,

416
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,950
but the Turkey when it's finally
done is going to go like, you know,

417
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,070
as a naive new parent and I'll
concede that might be what I am.

418
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,350
You're very early in the process.
I'm very early.

419
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,420
How far along are you? How old?
She's two and a half month.

420
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,420
She's two and a half months.
Right,

421
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,350
because you brought her to the
show seconds after she was born,

422
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:40,480
which actually blew my mind.
She was delivered in Jimmy
Vivino has dressing. Yeah.

423
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,280
You brought you,
you came to the show and I was like,

424
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:45,230
I can't believe you're
doing a show cause you just,

425
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,250
your wife just gave birth and
you said you and you said, uh,

426
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,370
what do you mean she's backstage and uh,

427
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,160
I walked into the dressing room and
your wife through the baby apnea.

428
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:01,640
I catch and uh, it was, uh,

429
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,970
very scarring for everyone.

430
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:05,820
But what we didn't know that when
people say like don't do that,

431
00:26:05,821 --> 00:26:07,770
they mean that you're going
to get your baby's sick. Yeah.

432
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,950
Cause then we took our baby to Maui to
see Ron does because I wanted her to,

433
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,630
[inaudible] says my teacher, I guess
we can say, uh, who's also from Boston,

434
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,560
from Newton. Um, and I have a lot in
common with him because of that, I feel.

435
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,120
Anyway, I wanted him to her to meet him
and she got a cold and we were like,

436
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:30,180
oh, when people are like, you make
all your mistakes with the first one.

437
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,120
I was like, that's what they mean is
we're on a plane, everyone's coughing.

438
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,200
We get to the retreat.

439
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:37,620
Everyone has like literally people have
pneumonia and bronchitis and we were

440
00:26:37,621 --> 00:26:40,890
like, oh, we'll be in the room.
Like we just, we fucked up.

441
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,010
Then like one day she got too
much sun on one side of her face,

442
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,190
but something I noticed,
I don't know if it was horrible parents,

443
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:49,860
I'm really terrible parents.
We need for the baby taken away.

444
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,180
But it wasn't a sun burn.

445
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:55,560
It was just like enough that it was
like she would go with tubercular ward.

446
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,270
We thought she should see
where tuberculosis is cure.

447
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,330
So she was about a day old and we
took her to show you lotus was,

448
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,470
who knows, you make those mistakes
with the first one you learn.

449
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,120
Bow felt horrible.

450
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,220
I notice a naturally occurring in uh,

451
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,090
in insurgence of what I call dad energy.

452
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,930
Women can have that energy to obviously,
and I can have mom energy,

453
00:27:22,931 --> 00:27:26,170
but I started having like that dad,
like she'll be fine.

454
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,350
And I meant it like she got more nervous
than she normally did and I got more

455
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:35,440
self assured that everything is going
to be fine. And it was like, oh my God,

456
00:27:35,441 --> 00:27:39,280
we're getting each other's yangs
right now and nobody asks for it.

457
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:42,760
I didn't read any book about it. I guess
exactly what you do. It's what happens.

458
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:47,220
Right? If your wife was super
chill, you freak out. That's right.

459
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,930
If you know what, we're gonna have
to take a break. We've talked about,

460
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,060
we've talked to you. I've got to wrap
up. We've been, how long has it been?

461
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,270
It's been like a close to an hour.
Jesus Christ tones.

462
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:58,630
Letting you guys roll the fuck.
I don't know much about this guy,

463
00:27:58,631 --> 00:28:01,630
but all I've seen him do is
try to put this show in a box.

464
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,530
You can't contain this. I'm
lightening and he's the bottle. Yeah,

465
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,560
we're getting and yanging. I'm
father energy. He's a mother. Ah,

466
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,300
I'm going to pay you a
compliment. Oh, I will love it.
Not right now. Several years.

467
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,100
Several years from now. You're going to
get a letter and it's going to happen.

468
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,240
Compliment. That's just going to
say, uh, you, you drew tress. Well,

469
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:24,980
it's going to be much less

470
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,660
own yet and you don't, and it's going to
be in quotes. So you know, it's not true.

471
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,990
You know what I like is that

472
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,943
you,
um,

473
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,710
there is a very popular vein in comedy,

474
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,200
which is the comedian that is very unhappy
and miserable and I've always liked

475
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:50,840
that. You don't mind that vein. Do you
know what I mean? That you, uh, and, and,

476
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:51,674
and there's some other,

477
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,450
Ron Funches also talks about
things that make him happy.

478
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,810
Yeah. But he talks about
things that give him happiness.

479
00:28:59,811 --> 00:29:04,190
And I think you're a the same
school, which I, I actually credit,

480
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,630
I think that is a harder path
to take. It's, um, it's a,

481
00:29:08,631 --> 00:29:13,631
it's a more original or fresh or path to
take because I worry over the years of

482
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:14,984
the people that,

483
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,740
that come out and they just tell you
over and over and over the world and how

484
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:22,810
I'm sick, something's wrong with me.
I'm bad, I'm nearby, you know, and,

485
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:26,510
and I'm a disease and, uh, I dunno,

486
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,160
I weary of that.

487
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,990
I appreciate that. When, when
you're starting in the clubs,

488
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:35,130
it's 90% 95 maybe just like,

489
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,610
and I got up there, I punched him
in the face, and then I realized

490
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,880
there was a woman and people were whoa.

491
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,010
And then you have to go up
and be like, Kleenex. Hey,

492
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:48,880
there used to be facial tissue, now it's
clean. It, you know, like it's hard.

493
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,090
But I'm so grateful that like the taste
of comedy consumers shifted towards the

494
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,940
positive and that started happening.

495
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,300
You pioneered that in a huge way and
made a space for people like me too,

496
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,720
that want to be silly. They don't want to
be like, and I said, bubble my partner,

497
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,230
why am I doing it? Like a voice.
You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

498
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:13,180
It doesn't have to be against anybody.
Well,

499
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:15,070
I think there's it and I appreciate that.

500
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,600
You know what's interesting to me is that

501
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,700
it's that I think there's a lot of people
that conflate negativity with quote

502
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,600
the truth. Yeah. So it's that whole
school of if you're being negative,

503
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,800
that's right. And you're saying dark
things, you're telling the truth.

504
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,520
That's right. And, uh, if you're not,

505
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:39,590
if your comedy isn't right now railing
against what's happening in our country

506
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:43,720
and railing about, you know, who's
president and what's, you know,

507
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:48,740
happening, then you're escapist and you're
not handling the truth. And I think,

508
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,360
uh, I don't, I don't think
I agree with that. Yeah. I
don't think I agree with that.

509
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:56,480
I think it's possible to
be present in this world.

510
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:02,050
Understand that not all is right with
the world and then try to find a way

511
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,640
back at the dinner tip. Try to
find the silliness, right? Yeah.

512
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,700
There are people that confuse being
sarcastic with having a personalities or

513
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,810
hating everything is having a personality.

514
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,630
This is a real epidemic you'll see in
people's Twitter. Bio is it says like,

515
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,320
sarcasm is just one of
the many services I offer.

516
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,500
It's secure in the way bath. You
don't have to do those things. Oh,

517
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,410
bless you. I hope we got that on her.
That was a good one. We can solve that.

518
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,960
We can get money for that. Yeah. You
sneezing a lot lately. Use Nasal tracks.

519
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,030
I just made up that chronic.

520
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:39,480
Now we have to go find a company that
and make them get that name. Is that fun?

521
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,370
It's a podcast you can sing.
Live it or not for was not true.

522
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,060
No. Charles in charge of
our days and our nights.

523
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,030
It's like when your final
shows of the tonight show,

524
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:53,940
you can do what it the most expensive
show ever. Nobody's ever going to care.

525
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,490
You didn't found out you
couldn't pay for a song,

526
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:58,860
so you saying the total charge
that was, yeah, you could.

527
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:02,310
If you could have sing any. You know what
I did. It's also not true. You know what?

528
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,800
It is not here. I it, I
understand it is with yours,

529
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,250
but it is not here and I'm not
condoning that. I say do it crawl.

530
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,510
You had me for a second thinking I
could sing all of led Zepplin the most

531
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:19,740
expensive catalog next to the Beatles.
You think if we sing led Zeppelin,

532
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,570
they're going to, they get a letter. No,

533
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:25,050
but I think that the people in
this corporation will have words.

534
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,350
I say fan that fire. Go for
it. I'll do it with you.

535
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,690
Maybe I'm not to
back to school.

536
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,460
I'll give me your

537
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,240
no, no, no, no, no,

538
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,360
no man.

539
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,000
Now I sing it so strange. Yeah.

540
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:57,480
That melody is a vet,

541
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:01,250
a Charles in charge of
our days and our nights.

542
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,250
Charles in charge of our
wrongs and rights. Right?

543
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,890
Cy Want Charles in charge of me.
What a weird song.

544
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,550
Why is he in charge of bronze our age?
Well,

545
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,960
terrible song. Anyway, there's no
better way to get out on a podcast.

546
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:25,260
Then me singing a song knit Earwolf isn't
going to let come know what's going on.

547
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,180
No one's going to come after us for
the Charles in charge things I say,

548
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:33,080
let them try. Yeah. Whoa.
Gorley's throwing down. Yeah.

549
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:37,730
I couldn't fire wall later in
court. You just crying. No.

550
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,170
Can I? This is a fun way to plug
my, my standup special dirty clean,

551
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:47,120
which is out on HBO now. There's a joke
I couldn't do and it goes like this.

552
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,940
First I go, do you ever get things
that you're not attracted to children,

553
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,690
which is kind of a funny line, and
I go, but that shit is everywhere.

554
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,030
Like what's going on with that song?
Here's your little girl as you do.

555
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,410
Why am I hearing this at the dentist?
It's like someone took a knife,

556
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:12,190
baby edge and Dolan cut a six inch
valley through the middle of my skull.

557
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,210
Is that the next line?

558
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,530
He had not a wake up with
the sheets soaking wet head
[inaudible] now we're just

559
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:20,770
loving the song. That's a good
song. It is a good one. Great Song.

560
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,200
But all I said was like,
that's fucking weird.

561
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,940
Like nobody in the room recording booth
like this through the glass when he was

562
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:31,740
like, oh, go to bird desire. Yeah, it was
like a Bruce. It's fucking weird, man.

563
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:35,370
That's all I said. Don't do that Bruce.
And I never called him a pet. A fee.

564
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:38,820
I'm not an [inaudible]. We're not idiots.
We're just saying the song sounds.

565
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,010
Why did they cut that out? Because
I'm there. The lawyers, not of HBO,

566
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,640
because the Production Company would
get sued. Not Hbo. Hbo was fine with it.

567
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:50,100
The production company
wouldn't let me do it.

568
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:52,800
And understandably because you're
calling him a pedophile and then I'd say,

569
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:55,910
Neil diamond girl,
you'll be a woman's soon.

570
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:59,940
Wait for that transition to be
complete. Yeah, we're fucking ski.

571
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:04,790
He's just 16 years old.
Leave us alone. Yeah.

572
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,330
As a lot of name, you're beautiful and
your mind. There's a lot of 'em out there.

573
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:13,150
I know. But those two were like kind
of subtler. No, no, no, no. I, but I,

574
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,930
I'm surprised that yanked, I'm surprised
at that. Got Yanked. It was yanked, well,

575
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,450
let's make some money. Make sure I get
the name of the special correct. Jody,

576
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:25,590
dirty, clean, dirty, clean. And that's out
now. It's out now. That's how now and uh,

577
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,180
on HBO go or Hbo now and watch the
special, which is really funny.

578
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:33,690
But then imagine that honk in it.
I know it's even a little bit better.

579
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,820
I had another,
speaking of it went out like that.

580
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:38,460
I had a job where I go with sent,
this didn't make this special.

581
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,260
I got some songs sound unfinished.

582
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:45,270
Dad's man has a barrow at the market
place. Well, he has to say, okay,

583
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:49,690
that's a good start. And then they get
to the chorus. They're like, oh, blah,

584
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:52,370
or blah.
I just for now it goes on.

585
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,460
Obviously I couldn't get for led
Zeppelin and the Beatles in this episode.

586
00:35:56,461 --> 00:36:00,300
This is going to podcasts already. This
is why I'm happy you're doing a podcast.

587
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,150
It's, it's still showbiz,
but like it's a dream.

588
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,240
I don't know if you've ever had a dream
of something that like requires almost

589
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:07,920
no preparation or effort,

590
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:11,520
but somehow impossibly produces a result.

591
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,470
I would say sometimes better than
something that we worked real.

592
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:19,980
I have calculated every question and
every response on this power hand and

593
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:23,580
you've said all the things that I
predicted you would say based on the

594
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,370
algorithms I was working
out long into the night,

595
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:27,360
so I don't know what you're talking about.

596
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:31,650
And I am old school and you've played
right into my hands. Pete Holmes,

597
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:33,090
an absolute desire.

598
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,160
I got a bad desire,
bizarre

599
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,880
terming out peaky. You're lying to
me. He won't sit on the edge of mine.

600
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:51,940
Neil, Pete, Pete,

601
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,140
you put that thought in my head and I
didn't think about it the rest of the day.

602
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,810
Calling Bruce Springsteen
cause we chat every day.

603
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:03,930
I'm sure not how he sounds
a terrible Bruce impression.

604
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,390
Oh Wow. Okay. Well that's what
is that him as a deputy in uh,

605
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,100
in an old cowboy west.
You're coming calm down.

606
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:19,920
Bad Bruce Springsteen. Impression of the
bad guy. If you're coming over to you,

607
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,010
we gotta get him. You know, we also got
to do something for the working man.

608
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,280
Marshall Dillon. All right,
I'm wrapping this thing up.

609
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:31,910
This thing's gone on way too long.
This isn't one of your nine hour bug,

610
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,550
just free flow.
A big believer.

611
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:39,200
It's after the first hour that you get
the good stuff. Who wants the good stuff?

612
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,550
Went not for hoop, but after, and
I say this, enter, he edits it.

613
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,090
Don't edit this out. I have that
control. So it's going ahead.

614
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,880
Who told us that podcasts
are supposed to be an hour.

615
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,270
I had had the experience of being on a
podcast and it's like our three. Nice.

616
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,580
Do start to feel like,

617
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:01,310
how does this stop bad
where I'm the guest and uh,

618
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:05,690
and I do think that they, if the studio
was on fire, they wouldn't wrap it.

619
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:08,720
I understand they're
trying to get a little,

620
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:11,810
a little more juice out of the
Breezy's. That's Conan. So breezy.

621
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:14,630
So that's your niche. That's right. Cause
no one knows what you're talking about.

622
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,870
Then I just say make it two hours. All
right Sonia, you got to end this thing.

623
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,200
Thank you for joining us.
That was Pete Holmes,

624
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:26,630
the heights dirty clean on HBO now and
Crashing Back January 20th 20th after

625
00:38:29,751 --> 00:38:34,751
true detective after true detective
where the sorbet after the heavy on my,

626
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,760
someone in a cro mask. I was going to
shoot somebody and then I'll be like,

627
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,990
why am I doing it?
Right.

628
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:49,190
I won't be doing that cause I'm with
you. That's my girl in business. She,

629
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,680
Mr Rob Roy, do you think you
could put me on this show?

630
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,320
CHOMP chomp on gum.
Hands on hips.

631
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,080
Scrunchy on wrist.
Mr Robroy,

632
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,710
why could be a singer?
All right,

633
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,610
this is ed piece out Tupac

634
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,920
and now it's time for another installment
of Conan O'brien pays off the mortgage

635
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,280
on his beach house.

636
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:26,751
Okay.
Of course,

637
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:31,751
I'm sitting here with producer Matt
Gorley and some obsession is doodling

638
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:33,344
something.

639
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,240
Remember the time I caught you doodling
at your desk sona and it was a button

640
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:42,470
you weren't drawing everyone.
You were drawing a, but
remember this story, hold it.

641
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,110
You remember when you were drawing a,
but it's,

642
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,570
I'm going to tell the story right
now. There's no time who said, I know,

643
00:39:47,571 --> 00:39:50,140
but you said you don't do
any work. I said, yes, I do.

644
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:53,450
And I flipped through and I have my
notebook and there was a drawing of a but

645
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,500
yeah. And where were you drawing?
Uh, but I uh, I didn't draw it.

646
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,980
Jason Chalami, our fueled
producer drew it on my notebook.

647
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,550
He was just very embarrassing because
I picked up sown as a book and see what

648
00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:07,970
works she'd been doing and it was just
a drawing of a button is or notebook.

649
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,970
Well do you remember when we did those
Roman ed Ed's and you were drawing

650
00:40:10,971 --> 00:40:14,930
erections all over the paper? It wasn't
drawing them. I was sculpting. Oh,

651
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:19,120
that's right. Um, Matt, we've
now released a handful yeah.

652
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:24,230
Of these podcast episodes and I thought
we should do a state of the podcast

653
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,170
where we assess how we're doing so far.

654
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:30,560
Why don't you give us your assessment
as a professional podcaster? Well,

655
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:34,100
I don't think it's any surprise,
but we're doing very well.

656
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,970
This podcast as an average of
five stars out of five stars.

657
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,590
The download numbers exceeded expectations
multiple times where they even upped

658
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,480
the ad sales and then had to sell more at,
so you're doing incredibly well.

659
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,040
Okay. So that's good. I don't have any
connection emotionally to any of that.

660
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:57,050
I, those are just, that's you
looking at various graphs and charts.

661
00:40:57,051 --> 00:40:59,720
You probably go into a dark room and uh,

662
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,640
just look at all kinds of screens.
Yeah. My number's seller. Yeah.

663
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,790
And, uh, I what I know.

664
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:13,040
So I was in a foreign country called
Canada and I was walking down the street

665
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:18,070
and a car drove by and a guy road rolled
down the window on his truck and said,

666
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,050
God and I love the pod cast.

667
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,010
Now that's something when you're
reaching that just the streets of another

668
00:41:25,011 --> 00:41:27,230
country.
I was in the streets of Vancouver.

669
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,440
Now granted it's practically
the United States. Yeah.

670
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,790
Vancouver is pretty much a suburb of yeah.

671
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,810
But I thought that was a good sign.

672
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,770
I'm hearing more and more people say they
liked the podcast and that's the only

673
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:43,100
thing I go by is humans telling me.

674
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:48,190
So your numbers and your graphs and
your charts and your telling me mm,

675
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,950
mm,
mm.

676
00:41:50,951 --> 00:41:55,560
Yan retires areas quadruple
their expectations.

677
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,010
Is that a fair, you think it's a good,
first of all, I didn't use that voice.

678
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:05,000
And second of all, I am a person
telling you that. Oh, you're right.

679
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,690
How do you feel about it? Are you
feeling good? I am. I enjoy it. Yeah.

680
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:13,310
I totally go by how things
feel. I'm essential, man.

681
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,040
I'm a centralist too.
I feel like I know it.

682
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:20,000
So now it goes through on a day
to day and uh, I go a totally on,

683
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,670
I'm very tactile,
so the hell,

684
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,270
I'm like Jeff Goldblum I have to touch
everything around me. Oh, oh, oh,

685
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,770
that's Jeff. Jeff Goldblum. I, um, I,
it feels good to me. Yeah. I enjoy it.

686
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,760
It feels like a form that fits my,
a rambling mine.

687
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,590
Uh, so now what are
you doing? Why are you,

688
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,290
you're on your phone when I need help
over here. I know what I'm saying.

689
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:43,670
Can I just say something first of all,

690
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,780
when we're doing the podcast for doing
the podcast? No. And I looked over him.

691
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,800
Your paper please.

692
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,540
And you were drawing furiously
and you're drawing. Who is that?

693
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:57,320
It's looks like kind of a chubby girl.
That's very good. Little Chubby boy. Oh,

694
00:42:57,321 --> 00:43:00,620
it's a little chubby little Afro.
Okay. And then you're drawing,

695
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:03,750
you drew all these weird
designs on the side, right?

696
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:07,310
So you're scratching and scribbling and
then I see you texting on your phone and

697
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:11,210
you're like the teenage daughter. I'm
trying to explain to you. We're at,

698
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,360
we're in Washington DC and I'm showing
you the Lincoln memorial and explaining

699
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:17,630
to you who Abraham Lincoln is and
you're on your phone. You know,

700
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,660
sexting with your finger gets,
yeah, put that down. Put it down.

701
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:22,760
The state of the podcast is
that the show's doing well,

702
00:43:22,761 --> 00:43:26,420
but behind the scenes it's a mess here.
You doodle constantly.

703
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:30,500
Why can't I doodle a little
bit? I drew a little guy. Yeah,

704
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:32,060
but you're not in the moment.

705
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,570
I'm always present it in the moment
you have an attention problem.

706
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,404
You know what I do.

707
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,240
But you know in my defense I'm
answering emails for you cause I am your

708
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:44,750
assistant. So I'm an I do this.
I shut my phone off on my phone.

709
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:47,660
Doesn't exist because I'm only doing
this all. Here's what we're gonna do.

710
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,090
We're gonna do a doodle off.
Okay.

711
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:52,880
I'm going to tell you something to draw
and both of you are going to give it

712
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:56,930
your best shot. Go. Okay. A puppy
dog with a Christmas bow on it.

713
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:02,150
Thank God this. Cause I dropped puppy
dogs all the time. All right. Yeah.

714
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:06,010
Go ahead and talk us through your process
as well. I'm imagining the puppy dog,

715
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,800
they both have a very interesting, like
sodas just blazing this. Yeah. Well,

716
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,510
she draws puppy dogs all day long.
That's what I do.

717
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,280
They're both actually quite good.

718
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,170
All she does is draw your doctors like
Conan is like the New Yorker style

719
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,280
artwork. James Thurber, and
he's got a bow in his head.

720
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:25,930
It's a Christmas pepe.

721
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,260
One done. Whoa. All right, let's take
a please sign it. Please sign it. Okay.

722
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,110
Quite a signature

723
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,340
to wow. Yeah. I drew, I, I was under the,

724
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:39,750
we were drawing as quickly as possible,
so no one said that. Who said that?

725
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,110
No one did. But I, I just,
when I heard competition,

726
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:46,680
I just immediately started going really
fast and so on it please put your name

727
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:48,030
at the top.
So I'm going to put,

728
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,460
I'm going to put an extra
piece of flair on this guy,

729
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,570
both of these and precedent. Does
yours have a bow on it as, yeah.

730
00:44:56,571 --> 00:45:01,420
He said a bow as oh, it
is. Okay. Right. Yeah. Wow.

731
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,110
Okay. So here's what we'll do. Uh,

732
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,490
go to earwolf.com to the page for this
episode and you can see the pictures of

733
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:12,260
these drawings and do you can vote amongst
yourselves or on Reddit or wherever

734
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:13,430
you want with friends,

735
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,310
whether Sona did the best dog with a
bone and drawing and the little Christmas

736
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,173
pop

737
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:26,300
and then keeping her name at the top
two as the assignment is clearly.

738
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,540
No, no. Okay. You're
taking a lot from Conan.

739
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,340
This is great for people
listening on the aisle.

740
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,520
And now what can I say something girly.
Oh,

741
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:42,370
you're the first podcast producer to
have people silently draw on the air.

742
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,880
Probably your downfall. You know, I didn't
know what eventually. What's that? You?

743
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,820
Uh, come on. Wow, that's not fair.
Mine's funny. Look at the dog is sad.

744
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:52,361
Should I?
Okay.

745
00:45:52,361 --> 00:45:55,510
The dog is sad looking at a Christmas
tree with a thought bubble that says,

746
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:58,360
I'm too wish.
It's funny,

747
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:03,040
the owners didn't know his religion.
Yeah, they just assumed. Yeah. So anyway,

748
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:07,840
well you withdrew in sharpie. You have a
tree, you have a like a border. Oh God.

749
00:46:07,841 --> 00:46:12,100
You know what? You and your
generation. All you do is cast blame.

750
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,970
It's beer, it's beer.
Where is my reality show?

751
00:46:15,971 --> 00:46:17,740
Where's my billion dollars?

752
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:21,700
I put the work in and I reaped
the rewards. I don't know.

753
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,160
You're the one who started a show
cause you didn't get enough love in it.

754
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:28,420
Well it's working.

755
