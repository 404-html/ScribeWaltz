I want to support Conan,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,590

ever will be. Well, if you

advertisers and in order to find great

thanks very much for even thinking
about lending a hand. Appreciate it.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,680
Hi,
my name is will Ferrell

19
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,820
and I feel awkward about
being Conan O'brien's friend.

20
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,380
Hey,
welcome to Conan O'brien needs a friend.

21
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,450
This is the podcast where I Conan talk
to people I've interviewed over the years

22
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:49,200
on my TV job and try and figure
out what's really the deal with us.

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,010
Are we friends? He said all
fake. What's going on with us?

24
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,210
That's my quest and I'm joined by,
I would say trusty assistant.

25
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:00,570
I don't think that's, I don't think your
trusty assistant, but Sonoma obsession.

26
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,710
What do you think, trustee? Hello. Okay.

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,270
And of course Matt Gorley, who's a
podcast extraordinary and an expert.

28
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,780
Oh, hi. You are. You're very
good at this podcast stuff.

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,990
And so are you and I thank you.
I don't know anything about it.

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,380
I am just babbling,
which I've done since I was born,

31
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,550
but you have been mad skills to make
sense of all of this and I appreciate you

32
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:27,240
being here. The three of us together.
We're going to get our way through this.

33
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,800
You were really nice to him and you
were the main amazing, so shitty to me.

34
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,000
It wasn't Shitty to you said,

35
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:38,001
are you trustee you for
a very long time and uh,

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,270
and what,

37
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,620
and I think I've done a good percentage
of the things that you've asked me to do

38
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:48,510
over the areas above 60% I
don't think over, I think, no,

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,280
I don't think, you know,
you're like chose dude.

40
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,610
You're like, oh my God, you're wonderful.

41
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:01,611
And it's not just impressed that
he's so skilled at what he does,

42
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,310
but you are a nice person. Wait a
minute. What am I not a nice person?

43
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,550
I don't know. I don't know you
personally. Yeah. Maybe we'll be friends.

44
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,683
They last night.

45
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,460
You're across from me wearing a
headset and that's not going to happen.

46
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,630
You spend so much time doing podcasts.
I'm sure that you're just in sufferable.

47
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,710
That's sadly true, right? Yeah.
You're constantly saying, boy,

48
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:28,120
this is a great chicken sandwich, but now
a word about this amazing new mattress.

49
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,360
This is hitting home. See that's where
I could teach you a thing or two.

50
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,760
I appreciate it.
Yeah.

51
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,890
Today's guest is will Farrel.

52
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,180
I don't think anybody's ever made me
laugh harder than will Pharrel and he's a

53
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:53,140
right here and he's got the dead eyes
of a shark will Pharrel. Hey will.

54
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,070
What I love about the audio
space so that the right term yes,

55
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,770
is that it's refreshing
and there's a certain,

56
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,640
there's a level of honesty or at least
perceived honesty when you're listening

57
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:07,960
to these things. So you know, that's what
a like a Mark Marin or people like me,

58
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,760
I think that's his is so good.
What'd you do that for?

59
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,490
Which do that for what number
podcasts is this for you, by the way?

60
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,920
I think the 200 and
this is maybe the first,

61
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,620
this might be the first trial balloon.

62
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:24,460
This is the first time I've heard my
own speaking voice and you're loving it.

63
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:28,780
Horrible. I, I sound
like a an irate woman.

64
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,470
You have a good voice. Don't sell
yourself. I don't love my voice.

65
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,950
I want to say I want to start it with
this. I don't think he should be here.

66
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,490
I think it was a mistake.
You are two biggest star to come in.

67
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,520
You have lowered yourself to be here.
This was a mistake.

68
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,480
I am just focusing on the sound
blankets taped to the walls here.

69
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,520
This is the room where they shot Joe Pesci
in Goodfellas where they've stenciled

70
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:52,670
Conan.
Yeah.

71
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,410
It really does look like we're preparing
for a murder. This is, this is crazy.

72
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,070
Why would you, what kind of, what's
what with your management when,

73
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,960
when cy told you, I told you when I saw
you. Yeah. Um, you grabbed me by the show.

74
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,640
I said,
I will not do your podcast.

75
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,190
You said that and you said it was the
conviction of a man whose legs were on

76
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:16,260
fire and I thought he's telling the truth.
You went, okay. Okay. All right. Yeah.

77
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,750
Yeah. And I respected you for that
decision. Your Will Ferrell you've made.

78
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,890
And then I came over for movies over
over four movies in Jamaica alone.

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,900
Yes. Yeah. We'll get back to that.

80
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,730
I know you're a management and
Mister Jimmy Miller, right.

81
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,840
I think he made a mistake. I think,
I don't think you should be here.

82
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,950
I think this was, well, I'm here. This
was an easy pass for you and a you.

83
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:43,500
She can pass right now. You can and we
can just cut this thing in half. Yeah,

84
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,270
or not even an a half.
Yeah, but you're here. God,

85
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:49,720
I want to walk out the store right
now that you can't the doors,

86
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:53,170
you don't seal it. Oh my God. It has
elderly. They're sealing it right now.

87
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:58,070
They have welding and the extra for
any blankets. So just a couple. Uh,

88
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,230
not very recently.
You never know when these things are,

89
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:03,710
so I'm just going to say very recently
I shared the stage with you at the Greek

90
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:08,210
theater and you were Ron Burgundy and
you were, when you become Ron Burgundy,

91
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,080
you do things that no one
else in comedy can do.

92
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,240
I was stood backstage and you as Ron
started to talk about for any other

93
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,780
comedian, it would be an aside, you
just mentioned, we're here at the Greek.

94
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,530
It's nice. We're nestled in the hills
here in Hollywood right now. Some wolves.

95
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,790
You started to talk about wolves being
in the hills and I watched as you talked

96
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,520
about wolves coming out of
the hill, coyotes, coyotes,

97
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,530
coyotes for maybe 15 minutes
and you wouldn't let it go.

98
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,270
And it was hilarious.

99
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,450
You went at least 14 minutes longer than
any other human would ever go on about

100
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:47,270
coyotes. Yeah, there is. Um,

101
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,360
there's something about doing Ron Burgundy
because he's an expert on everything

102
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,300
in his own mind. And it's great
if the audience is laughing.

103
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,490
They were laughing very hard.
Yeah.

104
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,570
But it's even better when they're not
because I just love to punish them and

105
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:06,680
just they can't go anywhere. And Ron
just has a captive audience. What's Nice,

106
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:10,550
because it's not you in that
moment. You will, is somewhere else.

107
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,350
Ron is on stage. There's also just
screaming names of communities at them.

108
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,220
Yes. Because if you've been to the Greek
theater for those listeners at home,

109
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,290
it's up in the Los Feliz area, Griffith
Park area. And so I kept talking.

110
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,920
I kept referencing though communities
down in San Diego. Yeah. Cause I'd driven,

111
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:30,680
I'd rented a car to drive
to the Greek theater,

112
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,050
but I kept saying I had a
list of like 15 communities,

113
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,720
which are foreign to the La audience,

114
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:43,670
but I just like any one
from Rancho Penasquitos here

115
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,950
and would just be like a
smattering of applause. I want,

116
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,950
I hear you and can Tada
and,

117
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:59,020
but somehow they came, they came
with me on it and I just kept, yeah.

118
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,240
Well then you started talking
about how when you're driving up,

119
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,520
you're on the one oh one but then you
get on the one 34 so you switched to the

120
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:12,470
five and seven 10 and this the seven 10
and again, I kept saying, stay with me,

121
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,363
stay with them.

122
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,330
But what I loved as a
longtime admirer of yours,

123
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,420
I get to ask this a lot. People say,
who makes you laugh the hardest?

124
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,190
And I consistently say,

125
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,450
will Pharrel because he doesn't care.

126
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,420
He goes down these deep,
deep wells.

127
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,360
He does not care if you're
coming with him or not.

128
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,950
And you follow him out of fascination.
And I don't know where that comes from.

129
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,930
You have, you have dead shark eyes
and you, I think it's that thing,

130
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,340
you know, and it happened on my, um,

131
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,660
audition for Sarah and I live,
you know,

132
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,570
they do it different every year as
you know. But that year that I did it,

133
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,550
everyone had to do it
in eight h and it was,

134
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,580
there's no audience and they're just a
camera and someone holding a boom Mike.

135
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,500
Yeah. And just the glow of Lorne Michaels
cigarette as he smokes it. No. Uh,

136
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,330
but it doesn't smell the darker
where you're literally alone.

137
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,220
Yes. And it's so intimidating
and so awful that I was like,

138
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,380
oh,
it can't get any worse than this,

139
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:23,130
so I'll just cry to relish the moment.

140
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,460
So that same,
I've,

141
00:09:25,461 --> 00:09:29,190
I've kind of just followed that practice.
You've always done that.

142
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:32,910
I remember early on when you were
in Charlotte live and you were not,

143
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,260
you did well right away, but you
were sort of sort of, but it hadn't,

144
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:41,710
I was announced the most annoying
newcomer where you realize, yeah. Okay.

145
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,740
Cherio Terry was like the outbreak star
and then will Ferrell most unknowing

146
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:51,270
newcomer. Yeah. Okay. There's one guy not
to watch, this guy won't shut up. Yeah.

147
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,100
But she would have forgotten about
that. Oh, I say my prayers every night.

148
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,750
So Erin member that I was doing the late
night show on the sixth floor because

149
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:06,970
when did you start? You just
start 93 or 95. Okay. Yup.

150
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,730
So right around the time my show is
sort of starting to gel and get up and

151
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:13,890
running. It took us about two
years to figure out which,

152
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,630
what the hell we were doing.
Right. But, uh, I remembered, uh,

153
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,550
a guy who worked on our show also hung
out at Saturday night live and he was

154
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:25,710
talking about you. Okay. And he said,

155
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:30,210
there's this guy will Pharrel
and he's really funny,

156
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:33,810
but he does these things and I don't
know if he's kidding or not or if he's

157
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:38,700
crazy. And I said, what do you mean? And
he said he did is tell me if this is true.

158
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,670
This is what I heard at the time. Right.
And I'm pretty sure it's not lore.

159
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,880
He told me that now this guy will,
this kid will,

160
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,290
the last sketch that he was
in on Saturday night live,

161
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,270
he had to be dressed in a certain costume.
Oh, the Jerry Reed outfits and like a,

162
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,360
like a full on country Music Star outfit
and he wore it to the after party,

163
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,260
which turning left always has and
then continued to wear it for weeks.

164
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,180
Well knowing for weeks, for
the whole entire second half
of the season. Yes, yes,

165
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,360
yes. And I had a friend of mine
then people started to tell me,

166
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:17,070
I kept thinking he's going to drop it.
So then weeks later someone would say,

167
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:22,071
I was at the Natural History Museum
and I saw will Pharrel walking down the

168
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:29,190
street in his country. Western
college. Describe the outfit too.

169
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:33,540
Yeah. Wrangler jeans, like 19
seventy's Nike track shoes,

170
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,130
a Western shirt with a down vest
and a trucker's cap chapters cat.

171
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,030
And I was playing Jerry Reed.
Yup. Uh, from the smoking ban.

172
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,690
Great Museum in a,

173
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,520
in a sketch that for some
reason you remember how the
shooting days when it SNL,

174
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:50,520
we had a pre tape but I should be shot
part of it in the first part of the day

175
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:52,320
and we weren't shooting the
second part till the next.

176
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,240
So I decided I'm going to hang out with
my Jerry Reed costume all day during

177
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:59,710
rehearsal and whatever. But then I
decided to wear it to the after party.

178
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,160
Then I wear it to the pitch
meeting the following Monday.

179
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,950
And then it was this writer
Tom Janice who was like,

180
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,990
yeah cause it was a run of three shows.
He's like,

181
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:11,500
please wear it for the next show too.

182
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:15,310
So I started wearing it show week
number two, then show week number three.

183
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:18,190
And I thought, okay, this was funny
enough. And it was, Tom was like,

184
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,630
please wear it for the rest of the year.
It'll be so inspirational.

185
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,090
And I'm like, you're right
Tom. I have to do this.

186
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,670
I don't know why this is what separate.

187
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,060
I don't know why this was the
edge of honor. Yeah. So I'm like,

188
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,680
there's no reason not to.

189
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,340
And it became this beautiful comedy
litmus test and it would get funnier and

190
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,230
funnier and funnier to people.
Other people would be like,

191
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,400
there are other people who are more of
the staff would be like, what'd you stop?

192
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,940
What's wrong with you right now?
I didn't wear it consecutive.

193
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:50,620
I would launder it on occasion,

194
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,150
but for the most part I wore it
from February to May. Yes. Yeah.

195
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,130
And at one point I had Alec Baldwin
was hosting and he said, uh, I,

196
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,150
those are normal clothes.
Is this an outfit you normally wear?

197
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,760
And I go, I go, I don't know
how to explain this to you,

198
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,960
but no, this is like a long
running joke. He's like, good,

199
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,130
because it's not a good look for you.

200
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,400
And I could see him with
those eyes piercing and he
was giving me like brotherly

201
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:26,050
advice and I go, oh no, I,
I, I know it's not, but I'm,

202
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,280
but once again, that
became a thing where, oh,

203
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,280
I got to keep wearing it. And a, yeah,

204
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,700
finished out the year
wearing the preread office.

205
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,880
You also did something that no one's
ever done before, which I loved.

206
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,760
Again, I'm doing my show. I
love, I'm trying to, I'm doing
my show. What it will be.

207
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,530
I'll tell you, I think
you'll remember. Okay.

208
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,710
I'm doing my show down on late night
and at the late night show, and again,

209
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:53,890
we're just a couple of floors. You guys
were on the sixth floor, sixth floor.

210
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:56,710
And so you,
you,

211
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,040
you came to us and you said,

212
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,070
I have a funny idea and I don't
think they like it sound out live,

213
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:08,020
but I could do it on your show.
And we said, sure. And you know,

214
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,430
we're doing an hour a night.

215
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,690
And so you played a
character called scrub a dub.

216
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,560
Oh No, this was, this was written.

217
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,670
It was Adam McKay was written by
Adam McKay, the great Adam McKay.

218
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,910
But you, you played scrub a
dub and Adam McKay wrote it.

219
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,210
And so you guys came to us.
It was both of you and said,

220
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:31,690
can we do it on your show? And we were
like, Eh, you know, it was someone saying,

221
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:34,470
do you want a Bugatti? Yes,
yes, we want to Bugatti.

222
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,190
You guys came and scrub a dub a, it's
hard to describe, but he's psycho.

223
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:43,180
Mr Clean of noxious. Mr Clean. He's an
obnoxious Mr. Clean who's out of control.

224
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,050
And it was a sketch where we're going to
have a website soon where you can look

225
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:48,330
up all the old stuff in,

226
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:51,440
in high resolution and this is what it's
going to like a running ad throughout

227
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:52,850
your show.
It was a running ad.

228
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,630
You Clive ad you kept
interrupting and I would move on.

229
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,190
You'd say I'm scrubbing up and you were,

230
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:02,560
I think you were bald and
you had a muscular and
muscular Mr clean outfit. Yup.

231
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,080
And then I would say, okay, well that's
great. Scrub a dub. And I would move on.

232
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,960
And then you'd be in the corner
and you'd be playing craps. Yeah,

233
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:13,240
the die with dice and you'd be on, come
on, come on and look, be my lead it.

234
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:17,540
And I scrub a dog.
And you kept it got violent.

235
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,690
It got out of control at one
point of spray painting on your,

236
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,260
you were on the set is kept interrupting.

237
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,520
So here's the crazy thing about it.
No one had told Lauren.

238
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,310
No one had asked Laurence
permission because we didn't know.

239
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:34,550
We didn't know anything. We're all kids,
we're all kids and we're all just doing,

240
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,680
well this is funny. They wouldn't do it
on turn it left. So we'll do it here.

241
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:37,730
Just bring it down to the next thing.

242
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,920
We get this call from Lauren who's
executive producing our show,

243
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,610
but he doesn't know. They sure if we just
get this call, which is like, you know,

244
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,330
if you're going to use my people,
would you let me?

245
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,990
And I think you got to talking to you.
I did too. You got to talking to you.

246
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:58,850
And I think, uh, Adam [inaudible]
got a talking to which was,
you know, no, no, no, no,

247
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:01,790
no, no, no, no, no. But we were
just completely like, well, oh,

248
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,450
they don't want to use it
here. Let's just, well, let's
call it Conan and his guys.

249
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,540
And that started this thing where the
most consistent thing I hear from fans is

250
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:15,881
that your appearances were always
these conceptual thought pieces,

251
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,830
comedy pieces,
the where you would commit.

252
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,520
And your commitment would make me commit.
I would never say this is a bit, right.

253
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,290
So,

254
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,550
so there's the time you through
a very complicated pre tapes,

255
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:35,970
you heckled yourself playing a guy with
a mustache and a Michael Jackson glove

256
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,630
and a Michael Jackson
jacket that was too small.

257
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,280
So you came out to try stand up will
Pharrel and then we cut to you with a

258
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:47,240
mustache. Yeah, heckling yourself.

259
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,540
And then the heckling gets between
the two of you and you say, Hey,

260
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,860
I'm just trying to do something here.

261
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:56,861
And then you as yourself being a total
dick and you kept kept wiping the

262
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:01,460
mustache with your finger and gesturing
to it and being a total prick.

263
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:04,790
And then you charged yourself and
everyone in the audience was like,

264
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,700
well how's this going to happen? Cause
the guy in the audience has a pre tay.

265
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,830
Oh that's right.
How are you two going to interface?

266
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,330
And then we cut to you insisted on a
body double. And who was a little person,

267
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,070
you know Michael Jack and a
Michael Jackson Jacket, right?

268
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:22,340
Who tackles you since suddenly
the reads me up you up.

269
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,860
It doesn't match you in any way,
shape or form.

270
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,540
Thank God for your late night
show because that was like,

271
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,470
that was like comedy heaven where I knew
there were other talk shows that were,

272
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,240
you know, very lovely to do. Yup. However,

273
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,110
they had their set rules as to what
they were comfortable doing and you guys

274
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,750
were always like, let's do it.
Let's try it right there was,

275
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,570
there was one where you,
we have the drum off. Yes.

276
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:52,571
I wanted to show off my drumming against
a nine year old kid and it was a nine

277
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:56,940
or 10. He was like 11, 11. Yeah.

278
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,690
What a really good drummer and I can't
play and he blows me away and I chased

279
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:04,320
him off the set. Um,
yeah, I mean that was a,

280
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:09,321
I was once doing Charlie rose and he
was asking about doing late night TV and

281
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:10,830
all the talk shows.

282
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,270
And I literally started going
down like just unabashedly going,

283
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,660
oh, this one's fun. You know, you
know, always doing Letterman. It's,

284
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:22,560
it's such an odd thing, but, but
hands down, Conan is the bass.

285
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,090
And Charlie was when careful,

286
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,890
like you didn't want me to play
favorites in any way, but I'm like,

287
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,530
I mean he's the,
and I saw what he was,

288
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:35,010
he was trying to not let me put
my foot in my mouth. But no,

289
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,450
you guys were proven that his judgement
was fast. Yes. You only have to wait.

290
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,390
We have to take a quick break.
We'll be right back.

291
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,310
And now it's time for a segment
called Conan O'Brien pays off

292
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,020
the mortgage on his beach house.
Yeah, we've been over this before,

293
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:59,700
but I took a pretty large mortgage and
then I borrowed against the mortgage and

294
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:02,730
then I took another mortgage.
Financially, not the smartest move.

295
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,100
That sounds like a lot of bad decisions,

296
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,110
but if it's enabled me to, uh, read ads,

297
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,630
then maybe it's led me to
my true calling in life.

298
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,230
Don't you think you can add
reading is your true calling?

299
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,960
It might be the only thing
I do. Well, I decided

300
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,990
this may surprise some people,
but I am not just a podcaster.

301
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,860
I also dabble in a little something
called television. Oh yeah.

302
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:38,840
For a little while. Just 25 years. Okay.
Sorry to come across angry. Anyway,

303
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,550
I have this TV show that I've been
taking all over the world. Uh,

304
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:48,080
and I love doing this. I've gone
to places like Cuba, Armenia.

305
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:51,170
We went to Armenia. SONA. That
was fun. Yeah, we went to Haiti.

306
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:54,500
We went to South Korea.
So many different countries.

307
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,990
I love these episodes.
Well,

308
00:19:56,991 --> 00:20:01,991
I just want to tell you
that my new episode of Conan
Without Borders is about to

309
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:07,010
come out and in this one
I traveled to Japan. Sona,

310
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,990
you've seen the Japan show.
It's absolutely hilarious.
Yeah, it's really funny.

311
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:14,390
It's really funny.
There's a lot of fun surprises in it.

312
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,370
Very proud of this episode. You
visit a place called Conan town. Yes.

313
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,070
In Japan. I have a lot of
adventures. There's a few.

314
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:24,500
There's a little guest appearance there.
It's really fun.

315
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,580
And so I'm hoping people will
check it out. Kona Without Borders.

316
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:33,581
Japan air is November 28th on TBS and
make sure to visit [inaudible] dot com

317
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:40,510
slash Japan to look at all kinds
of behind the scenes stuff, extras,

318
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,470
live streams and more.

319
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,840
And then we're back. Just like that. Yeah.
We did nothing. That was a good break.

320
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,720
Your level of commitment was
what we were talking about.

321
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,780
And I tell people that weight back,
sorry. Yeah. Back to Ron Burgundy. Yes.

322
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,230
At this live charity show.
Yeah.

323
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,360
I didn't even tell you about this
component because Jerry Seinfeld was doing

324
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:08,810
standup as part of our show and I
ran into his longtime manager, uh,

325
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,270
George Shapiro. [inaudible] Shapiro. Yeah.
And he has very set rules as to hell.

326
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,070
Jerry likes to be introduced
and doesn't want a lot of, uh,

327
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,690
they just want ladies and gentleman, Jerry
Seinfeld, and he has to have a stool.

328
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:22,690
And you know, every comedian has
their particular things that they,

329
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,190
they want a certain way. And so
he was like, uh, he was like,

330
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,210
Ron Burgundy, I love it. It's going
to enter and you know, keep it short.

331
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,460
And I was like, well, you got
to tell that to Ron Burgundy.

332
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,320
And then I could tell it made his head
spin in such a way because I knew we had

333
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:42,330
this crazy intro for Jerry
as Ron that, yeah. Yeah. Um,

334
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,170
and luckily Jerry thought
it was really fun.

335
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:47,410
I was backstage because we
had just finished our bit.

336
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,300
I'm standing backstage and when Jerry
is about to go on behind and so I was

337
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,000
standing here cause I'm just,
you know,

338
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,330
interested to see the transition and uh,

339
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:01,030
you know the crowd excited about Conan
and then just sort of having to settle

340
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:01,990
down for Jerry.
Yeah.

341
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,680
Well Jerry was brought in to cool
it off a little bit after Kona,

342
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,280
which is generally his role. Well we shut
the show down. Yeah. The cool it down.

343
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:14,060
Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so Jerry comes in
and you know, crowds filing out. Um,

344
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,500
he's not, I'm told he's not
that powerful in my business.

345
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:21,400
I'm just going to go after him. He's
not, he can't hurt you. Yeah, he can't.

346
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,650
No one can, you can hear a lot of
people. We can't hurt you. No, no, no.

347
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,450
I'm in a very snowman about the main
man effected by as Ferny blankets.

348
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:34,660
So, uh, but yeah, you go on and on and
on and you start listing his credits,

349
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:37,900
which includes,
you've seen him on the Arsenio Hall show.

350
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:43,200
This is for Jerry Seinfeld. Um, uh,
know him from Arsenio Hall. Yeah.

351
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,780
Magic Johnson talked to him.

352
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,440
You know him from the
Seinfeld show reruns.

353
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,990
You listen to the local affiliate. Anyway,
he was backstage and he was howling,

354
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,420
which was, he was really loud.
He wrote me a really nice,

355
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,080
he said he had a great time and um,
and I'm like,

356
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:06,040
thanks for indulging wrong with the
long. He's like, oh yeah, I loved it.

357
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,600
But anyway, you and I have
something in common. We both same.

358
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,480
We share the same birthday. No, we don't
know. And then we can go, sorry, go ahead.

359
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,330
I got excited for [inaudible] like I've
never seen you at Denny's for the free

360
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:20,770
cake on the day. I'm there. You're always
there. Denny's, right? You were, yeah,

361
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,090
I can get a free cake. Forget it.
I uh, I was in the Groundlings.

362
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,480
I was in the Groundlings before.
You were a contemporary of Lisa Kudrow,

363
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,950
Lisa Kudrow and then I,
shall I say she was a view

364
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,600
that means no.
So you start by taking the class.

365
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,530
That's what happens at the Groundlings
here in Los Angeles. You take the classes,

366
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,340
they have really names beginning,
intermediate and advanced.

367
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,970
So what I've always thought was hilarious
was Lisa was so hysterically funny and

368
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:54,200
some people have sometimes thought,

369
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,920
they sometimes make people repeat at the
Groundlings just to get, but you know,

370
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,360
we'll make a little more money,
you know. So uh, there was,

371
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,980
Lisa was just hilarious than they were.

372
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,560
I remember them telling Lisa she
had to repeat it. You should, uh,

373
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,260
you should take this class again.
She'd get again.

374
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,480
I just think one more and
basically it was like, you know,

375
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,040
one more round of payments,

376
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,880
maybe really comedy chops.

377
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,500
That's hilarious.

378
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,750
She and I were there a at the same time
I didn't actually ever join the ground

379
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:26,270
is cause I left to right at sona out live.
But I did all the classes.

380
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,550
You went all the way.
Did you go to the Sunday?

381
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:32,060
She was about to go to the Sunday
show when I had to leave. Yeah,

382
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,620
for gainful employment, for gainful
employment rather than pay to be on stage.

383
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,140
So funny to talk to anyone who'd
come from second city in Chicago.

384
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,330
They were like, how would you make
it the grilling? So I'm like, no,

385
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:48,200
you had to pay to perform there. Yeah.
And then when you were on the main stage,

386
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:52,070
you finally didn't have to pay. I
didn't make any money. No, they, uh,

387
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:54,200
I think the key is that, uh, second city,

388
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:58,490
I think they serve drinks and they serve
food and you can buy t shirts in the

389
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:02,420
lobby. You can actually, the
Groundlings never cracked that. Oh. Uh,

390
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,430
but I did that and I remembered
hearing about you later on.

391
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,000
I remembered hearing about you at the
Groundlings as this incredibly funny guy.

392
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,140
My sister Jane was at the ground
and she said, there's this,

393
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:19,970
she would rave about you. And a
I said, from the thanks to Jane.

394
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,750
Yeah. I said, from the sound
of it, he doesn't have it
is what I said at the time.

395
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:28,610
I was very, uh, defensive. Yeah. He's
competitive without even knowing me.

396
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,310
All I heard was someone else's funny
and I said, doesn't sound funny to me.

397
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:35,090
And she hadn't even given an
example of how you might be funny.

398
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,820
That's all I needed to know. I shut it
down. I think that says a lot about you.

399
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,270
I don't see that. All
right. I just am very,

400
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,480
I root against other people in comedy.
What does that say about me?

401
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:48,770
I know so that they're awful human being.
Oh yes.

402
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,630
Oh yeah. When others succeed
in comedy, I'm enraged. Right?

403
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,940
Is that not good?
You need to let that go.

404
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,140
I want you to do worse than you're doing,

405
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,800
so I can feel better. I'm writing
me right. What's wrong with that?

406
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,650
You're not going to get anywhere on this
podcast, that's for sure. By the way,

407
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:10,760
my crusade after doing this is
to tell no one else to do it.

408
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,040
If you're going to tell that you're
going to spread that out, oh my God,

409
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:15,740
I'm getting right on the old social media.
Is that what it's called?

410
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,060
It's called the soul. It's helped
with the kid. I should know.

411
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:23,690
I was on Twitter for four days then.
Shut it down. Did you enjoy it?

412
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:28,650
I really, I got way too sweaty and
nervous is too much pressure. Yeah.

413
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,700
I don't read anything. Uh, no, no, no,
no. I'm not interested in anyone's.

414
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,000
Uh,
opinion of what I'm doing about my work,

415
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,230
not because I skinned, because
I'm thin skin. Totally.

416
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,430
And I'm don't want to hear an anonymous
person say, uh, who has nothing to lose.

417
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:51,720
Say Well, all the good reviews
that I have been forwarded

418
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,460
boards my cough button.
Well you don't have that next year.

419
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:00,900
We'll get enough budget for a cough
button. Okay. Geez Louise. Oh,

420
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,620
you some, we're going to have to edit this
whole plot. This shows you as a human,

421
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:08,760
I always get, I don't reveal, read
any reviews or anything, right.

422
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:13,410
Except for the idle. Like you should
read the one though. It's really,

423
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:17,340
it's a great one.
And it inevitably always starts with,

424
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,430
I've never liked this guy. Yeah. However,

425
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:25,200
he was a pleasant surprise in his
role as the cat burglar. Sona,

426
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:29,730
what do I read? Nothing I
read. No, no, no, no, no.

427
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,860
I mean novels, but only
through about me. No.

428
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,310
Do I read any press? It can be the most
glowing review of something you've done.

429
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:41,520
You won't read it. And the reason,
even if it's glowing, yep. Is that,

430
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:45,570
what will I find? If it's good,
you'll always find the one,

431
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,010
you will find the one thing that
makes you go really? Yeah. Yeah.

432
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,600
You know though, saddled with, you
know, a a horrible lack of humor.

433
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,860
Oh, Brian's managed to overcome
it. Uh, you know, whatever.

434
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,810
And then it goes on the same time.

435
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,440
Bad reviews are fun is when
something has done really well.

436
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,260
You can tell critical
masses, you know, we just,

437
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,250
some of the most amazing reviews we ever
got were, were uh, on stepbrothers. Yeah.

438
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,610
So we were already
feeling like, oh, this is,

439
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,390
this is hitting all the right spots
and we've, we've made something good.

440
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,370
And the best one was Roger Ebert and
the review was like, whatever you do,

441
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,600
do not see this movie. Oh Wow. And
not tell your friends about it.

442
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:30,900
Do not buy it when it comes out on DVD.
And I think he literally wrote like,

443
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:35,930
this is like the sign of the end times
that this kind of creative ventures being

444
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:40,020
supported. It is juvenile acid.
Like everything he just like,

445
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,420
and you're just like, why do
people, why are they making this?

446
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,380
And it was just old man voice as you
read it. And a, and we were like, ah,

447
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:54,390
that's so nice because we felt so good
that was so off and it was so off.

448
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:57,420
But it was only out of security.
Could we, could we read them?

449
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,590
I am happy if I've doubled
down or committed to something.

450
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,820
You mentioned Tom, Janice, Tom Tennis
helped direct writer, director,

451
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:09,930
a show in Chicago that I did way back
in 1988 you probably weren't born yet.

452
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,940
And Kirk and smuggle smile,
his stage show in Chicago.

453
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:16,320
And I used to do a character.

454
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,360
I would have Bob go out and very pompously
Bob Odenkirk would go out and pump

455
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:20,661
asleep.

456
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:25,110
Tell the crowd that thing of Conan through
Improv is working on a character and

457
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:28,830
he's going to come out now and he's
going to do his character and it's a very

458
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:32,670
rich character and you're to ask him
questions and we're all going to build the

459
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,920
character some more together. And it was
this very, cause. This is how, you know,

460
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,570
this really this thing. And, um,
and this is, it's in Chicago,

461
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:43,450
which is the birth Improv, really
Mecca. And they're going to,

462
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,280
and so by your questions,
you'll see Conan on stage.

463
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:51,290
I had more depth to his character. Ladies
and gentlemen, please welcome Spooner.

464
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:57,020
And I came out and I had a spoon wedged
in my eye and I talk like a pirate and I

465
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:00,130
go are, I'm spooning, I am spoon.

466
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,710
I and people were trying
to help me and the crowds,

467
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:06,400
so they would die or questions for
me and we will build the character,

468
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:11,230
see spooned IIB. Any questions? And
so these people would say things like,

469
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,290
what's your favorite song? Like
a, a classic song. Yeah. Uh,

470
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,800
it has river in it. Like they want me to
go spoon river instead of moon, reverend.

471
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,720
I go, I didn't know what you're talking
about. This spoonie spoons song.

472
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,320
Oh, spoonie spoonie and then
it was a total fuck you.

473
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,400
And then someone else would say,

474
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:33,210
what's your favorite way to lie
in bed with your girlfriend?

475
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,610
And instead of saying spooning,
I'd say on a spoonie spoonie bed,

476
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,980
the crowd would become enraged.

477
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,190
And this critic wrote a thing and he said,

478
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:43,660
I went to the show and I liked the show,

479
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:46,660
but then Mr Brian took the stage
with his spoon I character.

480
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:51,550
I saw him miss opportunity
after opportunity.

481
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,430
I was so happy. Got We're going
to, I did a lifetime movie,

482
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,380
which unfortunately I need to give
lifetime permission to aerate more often

483
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:02,400
cause not that many people,

484
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:06,130
but I always had this idea to take
comedy people and do a lifetime movie

485
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,751
straight up.

486
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:11,640
So we did a lifetime movie called deadly
adoption and it was amazing and we

487
00:31:11,641 --> 00:31:15,840
played it totally straight and we all
the actors had to sign nondisclosure that

488
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:19,500
they would and guys on the cats were like,
this is supposed to be funny. I'm like,

489
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:22,320
no, this is just a change in
direction. I just loved the script.

490
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,590
So it's the most melodramatic,
it's this amazing kind of Meta thing.

491
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,820
Anyway to reviews,

492
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,120
rolling stone totally got what we
were doing but the New York Times,

493
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:34,920
television critic,
whoever this word was like,

494
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,810
it just baffled his mind
and said while Kristen Wig,

495
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,320
because proven she has
is a dramatic actress.

496
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,680
Mr Feral. If it's supposed
to be funny, it's not funny,

497
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:51,380
and as an actor he's terrible.
This,

498
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,570
he could not figure out what was going on,
which was bless absolute bliss.

499
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:01,130
Yeah. Yeah. The only thing I've ever
seen that that sort of, it's an analogy,

500
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:05,750
if you've seen the movie the right stuff,
there's a moment where I'm not. Okay,

501
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,950
well this is awkward.

502
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,940
You could have just how to ask you to
let it just edit me out when I say I have

503
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:14,850
not, I haven't seen it. Go ahead. If you
keep saying that. Okay, you can't edit.

504
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,760
We don't. We don't have the budget.
The right stuff. What is it about, oh,

505
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:21,600
it's about astronauts got space. Yes,
but anyway, but I haven't seen it,

506
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,340
but there's a part where they
get up into the atmosphere.

507
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,090
That part of the atmosphere that's not
yet outer space but not in the light gets

508
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:33,330
blue and it gets really weird.
I've always thought in comedy,

509
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,320
if you keep pushing something
beyond when it's not funny,

510
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,850
you can get to this.

511
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,550
It's then it's not funny then it's
really not funny and people are getting a

512
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:48,060
little irritated. If you keep going,
there's this little magical blue, um,

513
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:51,020
how light transition into you can,
yeah.

514
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:53,140
And I believe you are the a,

515
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,750
it's holding your hand over the flame
for a little while and just seeing how

516
00:32:56,751 --> 00:33:00,650
long before it gets really hot.
You also did,

517
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:05,030
I was there when you got your Mark
Twain Award and it was the funniest

518
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:07,970
acceptance speech I've
ever seen anybody give.

519
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,890
And then you did this brilliant thing
where you'll find finally you're hoping

520
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,640
the Twain Award you say what you did well,
which I was,

521
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:23,140
so I had this idea and I was so thankful
that they said yes without a hitch

522
00:33:23,931 --> 00:33:27,290
because I was preparing for this battle
because it can get stodgy that event,

523
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:30,260
right. And uh, and they want to see what
your speech is going to be ahead of time.

524
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,460
And I was thinking,
oh,

525
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:36,461
it'd be so funny cause you're handed the
bust and it sits on a stool while you

526
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:40,000
give your speech. And so I thought, God,

527
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:44,690
it'd be great to go to set
it down and just break it.

528
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,380
I miss the stool and have it just explode

529
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,230
on the stage. And then just play
off of the, oh Geez, what could so,

530
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,740
but, and I was thinking there, there'd
be like, well, we can't do that.

531
00:33:57,741 --> 00:33:59,680
The sanctity of that,
when I was building up my,

532
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,950
my whole argument that the mark
Twain himself would have wanted this.

533
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:06,980
And luckily they were like,
hilarious. That's great. So, uh, yeah,

534
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:09,250
so they allowed me to do it.
They,

535
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:14,150
and I've been just very delicately
stacked a crumbled mass, yes.

536
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:19,151
Onto the stool and then read my speech
as if I was standing in front of a

537
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,980
perfectly intact twain award.

538
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,810
What's the audience gasp
mixed with realizing yes,

539
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,170
but it was all a set up, but
it was a, it was really fun.

540
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,490
And I can assure you the Oscars,
the Emmy's,

541
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,530
the Grammy's,
whenever you went up,

542
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:40,220
the Times I've done an award show
or Ben and around an award show,

543
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,010
they act like their award is,

544
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,720
there's no way the goblet that Christ
drank from and the last supper,

545
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,870
that's how they act like it. And if
you have a funny idea that involves,

546
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:53,080
they're like, well, we'd love
to help you. But that's some,

547
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,590
here's the thing that's an Emmy.
Um, let me get back to you.

548
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,440
So coated, we talked. Oh my God, we love
it. Um, however, is there any way? Yeah,

549
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,830
my favorite voice always goes up.
My favorite thing ever was I, uh,

550
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,870
not my favorite thing ever,
but involving in an award show.

551
00:35:11,871 --> 00:35:15,970
One of my favorite moments was a, uh,

552
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:20,900
I did an NFL honors once and had,
I thought really good jokes,

553
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,220
jokes were fine.

554
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:26,820
And then I had really good slams on
the commissioner of football. Uh,

555
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,320
perfect. Roger Goodell,
Roger Goodell. Yeah. And, um,

556
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,240
were you hosting or hosting?

557
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,910
And so he comes in and he's this very,
uh,

558
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,040
really cool off, absolutely straight
cuts, all business, all business.

559
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:44,470
And he comes in and, but he, he
sees me a comedy guy. He says,

560
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,100
what hell you were asking Conan around.
Can't wait for tonight anyway, if for,

561
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,380
and I see what you're up to you
trickster. Right. And I said, uh,

562
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:55,050
we have a couple of jokes about you
when he said they're going to be fine,

563
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:57,750
they're going to be fine. Whatever you
want to do. And I said, you're sure?

564
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:00,210
And he said, sure, I'll take a look,
but where I'm fine with all of them.

565
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,450
I just want you to be you and have a good
time. And I said, well, thanks a lot,

566
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:07,260
Mr Goodell, please call me
Roger Goodell. It's like, okay.

567
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,880
And then not Roger, Roger, Roger Goodell,
the commissioner of foot. Yeah. Okay.

568
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:17,060
So then he turns and he walks over about
10 feet from me and he's talking to

569
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:22,390
someone and the woman, a person then
wouldn't gumbles woman come? No.

570
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,370
A woman comes over and hands him the
sheet of jokes and he reads through the

571
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:30,930
sheet of jokes and I have like six jokes
on him and then he hands the sheet back

572
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:34,290
to her and she comes over and he says,
uh, none of those are acceptable.

573
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,650
That's where like course eight seconds
had passed. Well, you have fun.

574
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:42,870
You minx that's what the,
uh,

575
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:48,000
that for one of those first SB years,
SNL was producing the sps.

576
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:51,390
Who did you norm Macdonald.
Norm was hosting is up radio city.

577
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,690
And I came out as Harry Carey
and they just wrote, you know,

578
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,640
we just went around the
room and rooster teeth.

579
00:36:56,641 --> 00:37:00,570
Did you go after you want to have to
someone's teeth and you don't know who it

580
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:05,370
was, but you and you very prominent
quarterback at the time and you were like,

581
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,860
Gee, I think I'd have the
money to get his teeth fixed.

582
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,170
And they cut to him and this makes it,
please find it.

583
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,520
It makes it a thousand times
funnier. He is stoning you. Yes.

584
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:21,790
And there were other athletes and it
was just Harry Carey not really knowing

585
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,250
who's out there

586
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,550
thinking he was at the source awards or
something. I Dunno. And like just, anyway,

587
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,580
I was apparently it was talked about
in the halls of ESPN for decades later.

588
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:38,120
Like, well, let's not have another
will Ferrell Harry Carey moment. Yeah,

589
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,360
they're lost. I say, yeah, me too. Um,
I don't want to keep you any longer.

590
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:44,310
I know that you were having
facial surgery today.

591
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,720
I am having not only facial surgery,
but butt implants finally.

592
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,150
All right. And this is a big day and I'm
doing it myself. I'm not some mistake. No,

593
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:56,490
I can do it. If I've got a
monitor system, it'll be easy.

594
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,990
You're going to look at a table,

595
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,610
you're in the line of ticking them
on and acting it out and you can go,

596
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,750
I can go right now. Okay, that's
good on a podcast and act it out.

597
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,810
You're really good at picking
stuff out. Own Butt implants. Uh,

598
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:10,860
I maintained this was a
mistake. You shouldn't have
been here for this. We'll see.

599
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,850
Yeah, we'll see. You may find you
maintain a mistake and I will,

600
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,940
it will make it my crusade and my life's
work to tell people to not do this

601
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:24,330
podcast and you will,
I cannot thank you enough.

602
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,590
And um, I maintain your, there's
some funny people on the planet,

603
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:30,960
but a will Pharrel has them
all beat by a country mile.

604
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:34,110
I really believe that and I,
I've, you've done nothing.

605
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,890
I'm filled goodwill and warmth and good
sheer. Whenever I even think about you,

606
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,250
you've just spent such a good guy to me
over the years and I thank you from the

607
00:38:42,251 --> 00:38:46,090
bottom of my heart and hilarious. Thanks
so much. Thanks everyone. Great job.

608
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:48,040
Everybody did. Nice. Great job. Yeah.

609
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,470
Hey,
all this fall,

610
00:38:55,471 --> 00:38:59,700
I've been checking something off my
bucket list for years and years and years.

611
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,680
It's been my dream to go out on tour,

612
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,890
hit the road with some of my favorite
comics and I've been doing that.

613
00:39:04,891 --> 00:39:08,130
In fact right now I'm recording
this in my hotel room in Austin,

614
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:12,390
Texas because we got a show here tonight.
Yeah. It's a nice hotel room. Yes sir.

615
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,700
Than Mine.
It's much nicer than yours.

616
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,650
I put you in the same room as the giant
ice machine and the extra towels. Yeah.

617
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,630
And it's a fun show of SONA. You've seen
many of them. Yes. It's really fun show.

618
00:39:24,631 --> 00:39:29,220
I'm at all the comics are amazing
actually. And how am I, you're good.

619
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,210
Oh Jesus. Anyway, it's been a blast.

620
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,290
It's a lot of fun.
And uh,

621
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,140
we are headed soon to Chicago,

622
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,590
Minneapolis and in Milwaukee.
So if you're in Chicago,

623
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:47,220
Minneapolis or Milwaukee and
you want to come see the show,

624
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:49,200
I guarantee you'll have a good time.

625
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,340
Grab tickets@teamcoco.com slash tour.

626
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,580
And so now I will get you a better room.
Do you have a window in your room? No,

627
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,970
I did ask them not to give you a window.
I don't think it's an actual room.

628
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,840
I sleep on the floor. Yeah,
that's a storage space.

629
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,073
Oh,

630
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,550
all right.
Well Conan's gone.

631
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:12,010
You said that you felt awkward
about being his friend.

632
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:15,190
It got a little contentious there. How
do you feel now after talking with him?

633
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:16,660
Will I feel so much better?

634
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:21,040
It's the longest conversation
we've ever had and I got, you know,

635
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,600
I've got to look into parts of his soul
that I wasn't able to look into before.

636
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,760
Yeah, I know. I don't. I definitely, how
do I say it? I don't feel as awkward.

637
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,380
Um, I know. Just feel slightly nervous.
Do you think it will happen? What?

638
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,420
Friendship. Oh mm.
That's a real long shot.

639
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,190
Look, I'm a pragmatist and uh, yeah.
If I had to put money on it. No,

640
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,353
thank you.
Yeah.

641
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,530
What is this now?
What are we doing?

642
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,700
We're going to listen to some
questions that fans have for you.

643
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,820
We're going to actually hear the fans.
Yes. You think they're going to be mean?

644
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:05,050
Yeah. Why? Cause when people don't
have to ask you something personally,

645
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:07,930
they can be mean about it.
But I think also people seem to like you.

646
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:11,320
It's just like being able to hear the
Internet. Yeah. Do you know what I mean?

647
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,940
These people have no fear of hurting
my feelings. This is just a scary,

648
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,490
yes, it's frightening. But go ahead.
Let's do it. I'm a great person. You are

649
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,050
Conan. How do you get your hair to
stand up like that? I just don't know.

650
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,700
Please tell me your secrets.

651
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,770
Um, that's a good question. And I did get
that question all the time. First of all,

652
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,130
it began naturally.
I just noticed

653
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,750
that my hair kind of sits up a
little bit and it has a spring to it.

654
00:41:37,751 --> 00:41:39,930
And this is like when I was a teenager.
Okay.

655
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,850
I was a big fan of rockabilly
USIC and they will,

656
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,830
they comb their hair up and all that.
And so I,

657
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,330
I liked combing my hair up into a big
wave cause I realized I could do that.

658
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,490
And that, uh, it created kind of a look.
And then I was watching TV one day,

659
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:58,850
and this is a long time ago when it was
this actress named Victoria principle.

660
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:02,740
You remember her? You're making a confused
look. She was on the show Dallas. Oh,

661
00:42:02,741 --> 00:42:06,300
okay. I'm really dating. I'm really
dating myself now. I thought you were.

662
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,900
Yeah.
So you saw the old I vain.

663
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,280
But there was this actress named Victoria
principal and she did a commercial and

664
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,480
she gave her hair tip, which she,
she dried her hair upside down men.

665
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,870
So I thought I'm going to try that.

666
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:22,760
So it was actually a teenage boy taking
advice from an actress who was speaking

667
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:27,761
to women and I realized I could make
my hair stand up even more to the point

668
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:28,910
where it got ridiculous.

669
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,750
And then it just became this weird habit
where I sometimes I would just try to

670
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:35,870
build it up into this big French
pastry that sat on top of my head.

671
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,950
And I was actually in Ireland once and
this guy was like standing by the side of

672
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:42,830
the road and I walked by and he went to,
good God, what do you feed that thing?

673
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,590
Wanting to my hair and now
I don't know how to stop.

674
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,880
Now I've become like big
bird or Mickey mouse.

675
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:54,190
I'm supposed to look a specific
way. I made myself a cartoon. Yeah.

676
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,100
Turned myself into an Emoji and
people want to see me be that.

677
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:01,190
And there were times when my hair
is flat and people are all upset,

678
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:04,820
like I'm a fraud. And I'm
like, okay, I'll go fix it.

679
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,390
And then I comb it back up again and
everyone's happy and I get a free latte.

680
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,030
Okay. All right. Moving on.

681
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,180
Hey Conan, which is your favorite
star wars movie of the prequels.

682
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,030
Thank you. This is Doneen from
Sacramento. Have a good day.

683
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,180
God,
the prequels or the ones that came,

684
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,440
there's the first couple that I
watched when I was young. Yes.

685
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,190
And then George Lucas
made a bunch later on.

686
00:43:33,191 --> 00:43:37,420
It seemed to upset people. Right. There
was a jar jar. Oh, charge our banks.

687
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:39,220
Who's in it. Yeah, right.

688
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,720
There's a lot of those ones where they're
sitting around talking and it's very

689
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:48,250
bureaucratic and it's like Samuel
L. Jackson, is that right? Yeah.

690
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,400
Samuel Jackson,
isn't it?

691
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,890
Samuel Jackson's in it and in Yodas there
and a bunch of other leap blurps and

692
00:43:53,891 --> 00:43:57,820
Glueck groups or they're just weird
aliens and they're saying if we're be

693
00:43:57,821 --> 00:44:00,220
brought to a vote soon,
yes,

694
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,970
it will then go to the next
chamber of the House of the elders.

695
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,050
What do we do then? Hmm. Difficult. It is.

696
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,440
Maybe we can introduce bill as alternate
with rider on it and you're like,

697
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:15,240
why?
Why are we getting bogged down?

698
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:19,740
The whole thing is like a PTA meeting
and then they'll cut to a young Princess

699
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:23,670
Leia and she sulking and
then Ewan Mcgregor is around
doing something and then

700
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:27,940
back to the conference room
where they're like, oh,

701
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,120
didn't go well. Hmm.
This could take months.

702
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,000
Let's reintroduce pill.

703
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:39,050
Maybe we get ombudsman to support bill
and then using a legislative powers.

704
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,940
Hmm. Am I wrong about that? Yeah.
Well Princess Leia wasn't in them.

705
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,800
I'm so sorry. I just needed to make
sure you knew what. Oh wait, it's,

706
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:53,490
you're talking about, is it queen? I'm
a dollar or a princess on a dollar.

707
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,340
Can I just say,
can I just say thank you Matt?

708
00:44:56,341 --> 00:45:00,210
Can I just say that I refer to all if
they're wearing a robe and you're the

709
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:03,720
object of someone's affections in a star
wars. I just called him Princess Leia.

710
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,810
That's the way I get through. Okay.
I'm sure star wars fans won't mind.

711
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,520
She's also a senator just
so we're covered. She's a
senator. Great. Yeah. Okay.

712
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:16,020
Well first of all, suddenly, oh look who
came to life over here with star wars. Oh,

713
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,130
call my name. Yeah. Am I not wrong, Matt?

714
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:24,140
That there's chunks of those movies
that are bogged down in the legislative

715
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:28,530
affairs of the rebel colony
or whatever they're called.

716
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,190
Literally the imperial Senate
and the Jedi Council Room,

717
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:33,680
which is just a round,

718
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:38,040
it's a round room and people were
bringing in papers and Yoda. I was like,

719
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,660
looks bad. It does. They use
the term trade disputes. Yeah.

720
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,330
There are trade disputes.
What a great idea.

721
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:50,140
That was the one thing that every kid
wants to see in their space epic is,

722
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,390
is a bunch of senators talking
about a tariff and a trade dispute.

723
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,280
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah. It really is.

724
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:59,640
Like they were taking the minutes
of what happened was George Lucas,

725
00:45:59,641 --> 00:46:02,190
he was probably in whatever
really nice enclave.

726
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:04,920
He lives in outside San Francisco.
Right.

727
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:07,740
And he had to go to the
DMV A and someone said, no,

728
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:10,680
you've got to get in that line
and then you have to mail it in.

729
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:15,360
And then he and Lucas was like,
yes, this is what star wars needs.

730
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,650
He was so pissed at the
Bush administration that
he named two of the alien

731
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,720
characters lot dot and newt gun right
after Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott. Well,

732
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,150
that's the stuff that age
is really well in films.

733
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,020
Can you see a 16 year old kid
chuckling at the Trent Lott joke?

734
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,820
What a mistake. Stay in
your lane, don't get it.

735
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:41,330
Don't get so enraged by the right that
you start warping your creative powers.

736
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:43,740
You know, it is. But anyway,

737
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:46,890
that's what I remember about that movie
is I watched 20 minutes of it and I

738
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:51,750
think they got a bill passed
and uh, and uh, it was, I was,

739
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:56,220
I was bummed out. Okay. Next question
is about a popular figure on your show.

740
00:46:56,221 --> 00:46:57,660
So let's play it.

741
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,190
Tell me about Jordan, Jordan, your
favorite person and your staff.

742
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:05,841
That's unbelievable.

743
00:47:05,841 --> 00:47:10,310
That guy has watched all
the Jordan remotes and his
assumption is that Jordan is

744
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:13,130
my favorite person.
Have you learned nothing?

745
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,610
Some of you are probably listening to
the podcast and have may not know what

746
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:20,220
we're talking about. Jordan Schlansky is
an associate producer on the show and I,

747
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,930
I started doing segments with him years
ago and people love it because he's got,

748
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:28,820
he's such a strange guy and uh,
he can be borderline rude to me.

749
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,370
Nobody knows what he does. And every time
I ask him, and this is not even a joke,

750
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:34,150
he says,

751
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,980
I have various duties and
responsibilities and I've asked Jeff Ross,

752
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:42,910
the executive producer and
Jeff's like those stuff. And
I'm like, what does he do?

753
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,210
He goes, stuff. So, I don't know. I
think Jordan has something on Jeff.

754
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,240
I think Jeff wants was in his Tesla and
backed up over an old lady and Jordan's

755
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,880
saw it and Jeff was like, just keep this
quiet and you don't have to do anything.

756
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,910
So yeah,
I know Jordan is not my favorite person.

757
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,230
I do think he's one of my favorite
comedy partners as a person.

758
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,240
No, he really can be very
irritating. Yeah. Yes.

759
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,640
Good wine recommendations and good
restaurant recommendation. Yeah.

760
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:13,630
But he'll talk about it for an hour
and 10 minutes. He has this manner.

761
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,440
You ask them about, well
what do you think? What kind
of wine should I get? Well,

762
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,480
traditionally the Malbeck
of course, uh, you know,

763
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:21,240
in this region because of
the earth and you watch,

764
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,780
and then he goes into
this stuff where he says,

765
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,420
you can actually feel the
sunlight in the olive oil.

766
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,340
When you taste this olive
oil, you actually tasting
the sunlight, the Tuscan sun,

767
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,910
and you're tasting the dreams and
disappointments. And you're like, no,

768
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,720
I mean I've,

769
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,880
a friend of mine asked him about an
Italian restaurant once and he goes, well,

770
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,140
you can go to this one which is at least
start on day or you can go to this one,

771
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:43,990
which is, but yeah, he's like,

772
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:46,740
it's your personal preference
and I didn't even know.

773
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:51,700
Those are two different things. I don't
think they are. Do they serve food?

774
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,020
Now he's out of his mind.

775
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,760

Godfrey's amazing colossal podcast.
Hi,

789
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:07,050
I'm Alan Alda and I'm a guest on Gilbert
Godfried. Amazing, colossal podcast.

790
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:10,890
You've got to listen to this. They
made me laugh. I left like this.

791
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,280
You were not prepared for what
a big star you would come after.

792
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,750
That was that great story about how
your face was more recognized to those

793
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:26,720
students than Lincoln's.
Isn't that weird? Bizarre.

794
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:30,320
And they tried it my
face and Lincoln's face,

795
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:33,800
and they showed it to schoolchildren at,
and during those years,

796
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,710
they recognized me more
easily than Lincoln.

797
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:38,900
And that's hard to believe
because he had his own penny.

798
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,273
Wow.

799
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,640
Join Gilbert, frank and their
guests. Allan, all that. This Monday,
