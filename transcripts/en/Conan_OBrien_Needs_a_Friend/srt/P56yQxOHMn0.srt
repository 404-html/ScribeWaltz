1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,260
Let's face it. Everybody wants to be
able to play a musical instrument,

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:11,640
but the problem is most people
that teach music are criminals,

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,480
murderers, just unscrupulous
types. That's just true.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,140
Always be where someone who wants to
teach you a musical instrument that way

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,153
lies evil.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,460
It's what you want to do is you want to
learn a musical instrument on your own

7
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:26,460
where there's no pressure.
That's where the musician APP comes in.

00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,300
Hi,

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,800
my name is Dax Shepard

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,260
and I feel very optimistic about
being Conan O'Brien's friend

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,420
on the fence.

19
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,470
Hey there, welcome to Conan O'brien needs
a friend to show her. I come to Brian,

20
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:32,940
speak to celebrities,

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,590
interesting personalities on
the hopes of finding myself,

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,360
possibly a friend and I'm talking one
that isn't on my payroll so it doesn't

23
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,160
work for me.
A real pal.

24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,720
I'm aided in my quest by my trusty
assistant Sonoma of session.

25
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,110
Hi.
And my producer Matt Gorley.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,920
Hi at today's guest is someone,

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,960
someone I have

28
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,160
a bone to pick with. We'll
talk about that later. Uh,

29
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,480
I do love the Guy Dax Shepard.

30
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,090
I know we've had some stutters steps,
but I'm not giving up on this.

31
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,130
You think it's possible? Absolutely.
There is a little bit of, uh,

32
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,500
an incident that happened between
us that we won't get into right now.

33
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:25,460
We're going to save that just a little
bit, which I think caused us, uh,

34
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,950
to uh,
fail a minute fire.

35
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,930
It was a misfire in our attempts to
get together and become real friends.

36
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:36,490
And I mean you a Christian and myself
and my wife lives a really getting

37
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:39,700
together as a foursome. Yes. A
double day. Proper Double Day.

38
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,900
I proper double date adults. Babysitters.
You have a whole nine valet parking.

39
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,460
Yeah. Then into the farmer's
daughter Motel on Fairfax. Exactly.

40
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:51,160
And then we switch it up.
We just pop on something exciting.

41
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,650
We'll see what happens.
No expectations.

42
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:58,710
It's a little Ang Lee ice party scene
where there's only four of us and uh,

43
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,780
we put keys in and so it's,

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,390
if we don't pick our own spouses, nothing
exciting has happened. Right. I mean,

45
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:08,800
if we do pick our own spices,

46
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,920
but spouses the best we fell
apart there will listen.

47
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,920
The best part about that scenario is
you and I would be on the are, you know,

48
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:20,230
respect of beds at the farmer's daughter
hotel and we would be so excited about

49
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:24,010
the possibilities in our wives
would be so bummed. Yeah, it's true.

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,713
It's true.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,720
They both would be praying that we
got our own car keys in that scenario.

52
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,330
Yeah. Isn't that awesome? That's exactly
what would happen. It's exactly what,

53
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:40,960
what happened, uh, has a lot about
us. You and I, I think it does.

54
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,950
I think a women cringe,
uh, when we look at them.

55
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,030
But that's not true. You're
your real man's man. I'm
going to say this about you.

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,670
Oh, okay. You're a man's man.

57
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:56,671
And I say this because I visited a your
house not long ago when we recorded your

58
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:01,780
podcast where you had an incredibly
comfortable chair and I did not.

59
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,710
But I guess that's your thing. Well you
had a couch. It wasn't that uncomfortable.

60
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,050
It wasn't great. I didn't have
you on a, you know what it was?

61
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:12,130
I'm pretty sure there's a
foldout iron bed in that it's,

62
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:15,490
it's one of those kind of an iron
maiden. Yeah, there's a stick.

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,040
It was not a comfortable plush
couch. I didn't feel that
way. Well I, first of all,

64
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,800
I apologize and you though,
he's,

65
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:27,760
your chair was your chair is a lazy boy.
It's incredible.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,260
It's incredible.
Chair.

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,490
I gave it up one time on one episode
because if you interviewed David Harbour,

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,560
I have not. Do you know who he is from
stranger things? He's the cop. Yeah.

69
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,950
He arrived and I was like,
this guy's a fucking grizzly bear.

70
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,090
Look at this man.

71
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:48,091
He was just such a man then I felt it
would have been inappropriate to not give

72
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:50,980
him that lazy boy chair.

73
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,400
That's interesting cause I came in
and said this is an equal, I'll,

74
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:59,680
I'll put him on the couch and I'll keep
the proposal. That was a good safe.

75
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,210
I will say that you are,

76
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,950
you were the manlier of men because I
come to your house and I see first of all

77
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:10,951
this like all terrain vehicle parked
on in your compound on a trailer,

78
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,440
on a trailer. But it is one of
those things that looks like in the,

79
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,280
it's a mad max post apocalyptic vehicle.

80
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,290
It's an la of actuation
evacuation crisis vehicle.

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,570
Like when the 7.0 hits. Yeah.
My family and I will be in that.

82
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:35,110
It's a Polaris razor four seater turbo.
That's what I thought it was.

83
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:37,420
I saw it and it's like that's
a Polaris razor four seater.

84
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,650
I knew you were thinking
that and I appreciated that
you didn't try to embarrass

85
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,560
me. I think you knew what
it was and you were afraid.

86
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,030
He might not know what even owns, so
I'm not even gonna bring it up. Yeah.

87
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,970
Respected that. Yeah. There's
this great documentary.

88
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:55,840
I especially think you as the
owner of a boy should watch.

89
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:59,890
He was, uh, quite, uh, I purchased
a boy. That's correct. Well,

90
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,290
you made you have a
daughter and I have a son.

91
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,310
I think that's what you're trying to say.
Yes.

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,040
You have a daughter and his son and there
is a documentary called the mask you

93
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,920
live in. Have you heard
of this? No. Oh my God.

94
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:15,600
I have to bring it up because you're
talking about masculinity and it is all

95
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:18,960
about how we culturally,
um,

96
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,550
lay the foundation of what a boy or a
man supposed to be and pretty much how

97
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,500
cancer as it is for all of us.

98
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,050
And they've kind of lay out four criteria.
And as we were learning the criteria,

99
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:36,051
I was with Monica and my
wife and it became abundantly
clear what a cliche I am.

100
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,820
It was like sexual conquests.
That's, that defines manhood. Um,

101
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,743
fighting.

102
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:48,270
I'm consuming copious amounts
of booze or alcohol or drugs.

103
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,400
And then money got to make money
to be a man. And I was like, oh,

104
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:58,230
that's been driving me since eight
years old. Those four things all day,

105
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:03,230
every day. I am one on a four.
That's crazy. No. Yeah, I don't,

106
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:03,681
uh,

107
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:08,681
I heard you can suck down a eighth of
an ounce of kind kush weed in was single

108
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,560
toe. That's what I've
been told about you. Uh,

109
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,970
glad that that's out there about and
not true. I, it's an, it is not true.

110
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,550
I never, uh, I never dabbled
much. Never really dabbled
at all in drugs. I will say.

111
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:27,500
And uh, the Times I've tried sweet Mary
Jane, I think you guys call it. Oh yeah,

112
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:30,710
that's what we're calling it.
A or wacky cigarettes. Uh,

113
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,120
the time it was my uncle that told you
you would really benefit was the one who

114
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,300
Robert Smuggle it was my memory or no?
Uh, no, it was pretty recent. That, okay.

115
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,580
So the fact that you're
bragging about myths meant,

116
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,880
it makes me question your memory to the
fact that the fact that you're like, Huh,

117
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:50,360
I remember. I so Brian, right?
Brian. Right. Pretty good. Huh?

118
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,550
I shocked myself. That's why.
Yeah. Yeah. Robert's Michael,

119
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,090
a brilliant writer and uh,
insult the comic. Yeah.

120
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,630
Trying to insult comic dog and Blah,
blah, blah. And I've known him forever.

121
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:04,310
And when we were at Santa
and life together, he said,

122
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:07,730
you're the only guy I know who would
benefit from smoking because it would,

123
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,760
it would calm you down. You're
so tightly coiled that it, when,

124
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,790
if you smoked,

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
the cancer that you would get would
still be offset by the relaxation of the

126
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:22,700
cigarette. Yeah. Yeah. But, but you
know, you talk about masculinity.

127
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,660
I think I've done a pretty good
job with my son in setting.

128
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,720
I think in a lot of ways,
a low bar he gets to make,

129
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,810
he makes fun of me
constantly. And, and, uh,

130
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:37,790
I'm very self deprecating around him.
I'm not a big sports guy.

131
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,650
I'm not an incredible athlete. I work
out a lot, but I'm not a great athlete.

132
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,940
And so I have not set that expectation.
I'm trying very hard about the stuff.

133
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:51,710
Like, um, don't cry. Oh, I've
never told him not to cry. Okay.

134
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,590
And what about wished privately? Sometimes
he would stop, you know, uh, you know,

135
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,480
there've been times, there were
times when, uh, you know, when,

136
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:04,080
when he would lose it a over something
that I thought was kind of small and I

137
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:08,730
think like, Gee, you know, you're, you
know, my son is in his late thirties and

138
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,710
you know what, it'd be like,
okay, you dropped your donut,
but you shouldn't cry. No,

139
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:17,610
no, my son, uh, no, he
doesn't. I've never done that.

140
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:20,810
I've never shamed him for in any way.
I don't think. Well, how about this?

141
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,660
It starts with a very simple observation,

142
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:25,580
which I was definitely
true where I grew up,

143
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:30,330
which is we almost defined
boys in opposition to girls.

144
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,660
And so the worst thing you can be as a
boy is to be a girl, is to be feminine.

145
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,610
And in order of insults on a playground,
it is basically your sissy,

146
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,570
your a girl. Right? And it, and it's,

147
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,600
so the only thing topping the female thing
is then the homophobia. So it's like,

148
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,180
so it's tricky is when you're,

149
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:55,210
when you're introducing this concept
that to be a girl is bad and it's not boy

150
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:57,690
like you inadvertently are,

151
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,950
are basically establishing a hierarchy
of one's better than the other if you,

152
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,470
if you're supposed to avoid that.
So,

153
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,160
and then we get in these very insular
clubs cause it's very hard for us to emote

154
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:10,040
and to talk about our feelings
because we're told not to do that.

155
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,800
And then we get old enough where we start
drinking and now we'd say I love you

156
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:14,780
and that's why we drink.
So we can tell everybody we love him.

157
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,960
And now we're in this little pod and
we've been told our whole lives that being

158
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:22,940
a a woman or a girl is bad.
So then weirdly we feel superior to them.

159
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,870
I think it's all tricky. And I, I
found myself going like, oh yeah,

160
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,980
I got that software downloaded
into me big time. But you,

161
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,380
it sounds like you are a,
you are unpacking it. I'm
trying, but some of it is.

162
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:41,381
So I find this when I'm working on a
car and I hit my hand and I really draw

163
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:47,780
blood, like it's more, I'm already
frustrated. And then the wrench slips.

164
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:51,590
And then I cut my hand, my f,
and I'm ashamed to admit this,

165
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:56,591
but the first word out of my mouth is a
homophobic pejorative because it's like

166
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,560
in my reptilian brain,
like on the playground,

167
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,390
that was the worst thing
you could be called.

168
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,380
And you were trying at all times and not
be called that. And so it's just, it's,

169
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,270
it's cemented in there
and I can't get it out,

170
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,450
you know,
I know enough not to do that in real life,

171
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:15,760
but like in a moment where I'm,

172
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:19,160
I got really badly hurt and I'm
already frustrated that we're,

173
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,640
that word comes out and it's
cuckoo. I, cause I'm not homophobic,

174
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm trying to relate to you.
Uh,

175
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,970
but I don't work on cars.

176
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,980
And the closest I can get to is if I'm
watching a PBS documentary on Emily

177
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,580
Dickinson. Great, great. Uh, and,

178
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,230
and they leave out the part where she
was in love with her gardener out the

179
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,730
window.
Exactly.

180
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,670
And they skip that part and they say
they're going to get to it later.

181
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,050
I usually shout out some kind of a slur.
Yeah,

182
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,290
it'd be it racial homophobic.
Right.

183
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,680
And I worry that my son will see that
and feel that I'm less of a man while I'm

184
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:57,520
watching the Emily Dickinson.
Yes. But it's very hard.

185
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,500
You do have that software.
I don't think I have that software.

186
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,090
You don't?
I don't think I have.

187
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:08,060
How could you have grown up in
Massachusetts or however you guys say it?

188
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,790
That's exactly how we say it.
You know that as a exceedingly tall,

189
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:16,570
redheaded kid and not have been called
names. You are all those names. No, no.

190
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:21,010
I was called names. I, uh, I, you know,

191
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,480
got into, uh, you know,
scrapes every now and then.

192
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,100
Uh, I was, uh, I had my nose
broken once that very badly,

193
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:33,160
and the north end of Boston. Uh, what age?

194
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,240
I was 18. And I was, uh,

195
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,280
a salted by a group. I believe they were
a young Italian men who didn't think, uh,

196
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:46,210
an Irish guy should be in there. I
swear to God. And so ironically, right?

197
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:50,110
It's like an 18th centuries wobble.
Yeah. It really was like, look,

198
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,430
and I had Ushman has come
into the Italian section.

199
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,220
What is this?
Is this 1820 well,

200
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:01,580
the saddest socio dynamic, if we're
going to use words like that. I'm not,

201
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:05,790
that's not even a word. I just kind
of, you're a strong guy and you've,

202
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,420
you've had a lot of experience fighting.
Yes. Okay. How confident are you that,

203
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,720
like right now if I whipped this podcast,

204
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:17,140
headset off and came across
the room and started swinging,

205
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:20,910
that you'd be able to handle me? I've
lived, I feel good about it. Yeah. Yeah.

206
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,720
What would my do you think I would be a
worthy opponent or, and just be honest,

207
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,970
I don't strike you as a goal. I'll be
honest. I'll tell you some things. Yeah.

208
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,420
You're, you're strong. I know you exercise
a lot. Yeah. I think you're strong.

209
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:35,260
You're bigger than me.

210
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,250
I think you outweigh me probably
by 30 pounds or so of debts.

211
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:43,490
Muscle weight. Yeah. You're thin. You're
whatever you have is muscle muscle. Well,

212
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,560
not all of it. Did you wrestle with
your brothers a lot growing up? Uh,

213
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,570
not effectively. I was quickly
overwhelmed by my oldest brother Neil,

214
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:53,710
who was much,

215
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:57,070
much bigger than all of us and we'll
just sit on me and then laugh as I was

216
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:01,630
underneath him. Right. Okay.
Well you know, much like, um,

217
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,220
uh, Tarzan grew up around
apes and he could break it.

218
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,960
He could swing from trees like yeah.
Yeah.

219
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,340
So my brother was five years older than
me and he fought me every hour of every

220
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:15,620
day and I think that made me
a very good wrestler. Yeah.

221
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,580
Cause I was fighting someone much
bigger than me, older than me.

222
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:22,660
So I feel like my wrestling
skills are really on point.

223
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,100
I fought my mother physically.
Okay. Uh, which didn't go well.

224
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:28,810
She also bashed me.
Okay.

225
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,210
So then I went after my grandmother
who lived in the House with us.

226
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:36,220
She also gets her, she also one which
did she employs, she was in her,

227
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,920
she was in her nineties.
Okay. All right. All right.

228
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,410
She know she used just brute strength.
So I think your price,

229
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:48,700
he also had a mouth, like a sailor too,
right? She had got a psychological,

230
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:50,530
don't get me started on that one.
You know,

231
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:55,220
my lived in the house with us when we
were growing up and she had grown up.

232
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:55,970
She's,
uh,

233
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,970
had lived a very long time and she had
grown up in Massachusetts during the

234
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,120
early 20th century.
I mean,

235
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:08,780
I think she was like 22 years old
when the titanic sank. Oh, real.

236
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:11,450
And show she on Saint Patrick's Day,

237
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,260
she pulled me aside and she told me,

238
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,150
now you're going to go to school today
and all the Protestant kids who are going

239
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:23,270
to tease you. And I
was like, this is 1975.

240
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,980
And you know,
I'm,

241
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:29,330
I'm going to this racially mixed
public school where, you know,

242
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:32,360
kids have Afros, there's Korean
kids. There's mean. It's just,

243
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,240
no one's thinking about that.
And she said,

244
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,760
go to school today and the Protestant
kids are going to laugh. He,

245
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,780
and I'm the laugh at you. I'll
never forget that. She said,

246
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,540
and they're going to try and, uh,
they're going to try and rile you.

247
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,210
And she said they're going to
put chocolate in your milk.

248
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,160
I thought like,
oh my God,

249
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:55,161
that's something that happened to her
in 1902 some protestants put a piece of

250
00:15:57,451 --> 00:16:01,720
chalk and her milk and got the best
of muddy Reardon, you know, and,

251
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,220
and I was like,
what?

252
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,820
And then of course I went
in a bowl thermal and your
oil lamp and when you light

253
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,280
a smoke up the loud, yeah,
it's changed your whale oil

254
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,770
for seal oil and the light
will be dimmer than you expect.

255
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,890
So she, um, and then I
got to school and like,

256
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:27,690
people are wearing dashikis and you know,
but anyway,

257
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,020
the point sheet,

258
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,080
uh, it didn't happen. It didn't
happen to you. It didn't happen.

259
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:36,320
It was not mocked for being Irish.
I was mocked for being a,

260
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:39,140
I got hand me down clothes
early in my life and my pee,

261
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,930
my pants never fit cause
my legs grew so fast.

262
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,090
So I was constantly tormented. Where's
the flood? Okay, where's the flood?

263
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,300
Right? Where's the flood? And for
awhile I didn't understand it.

264
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:54,230
And then they said, [inaudible] someone
had to explain if there were a flood,

265
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,750
you would raise your pants.
And I was like, oh, okay.

266
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,140
Just put chalk in my milk then. Right,
right. Let's just cut to the chase.

267
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:05,090
Put the chalk in my mouth, but it makes
me think, did you read the first tycoon,

268
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,340
the Cornelius Vanderbilt?
I've read,

269
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,600
I've skipped through it and read
pieces of it, but I love it. I love it.

270
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:16,330
I've read all those, uh, where the
parishioner, what'd he say? Uh,

271
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,400
the class, those token the best, yes.

272
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:24,090
The rigging that golden age. Yeah.
They called parishioner clients.

273
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:29,060
I don't know at any rate of all those
guys. Uh, Carnegie, uh, you know,

274
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,530
uh, Rockefeller, Rockefeller,

275
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,560
the most fascinating is
Cornelius Vanderbilt because
he was just a tough son of

276
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,900
a bitch. And, um, he got, grew up just,

277
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,020
I think he had like one row
boat when he CRD. He did. Yeah.

278
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:45,650
He let on a little island.
It was all Dutch people and uh,

279
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:48,980
he grew it into this steam
ship empire. But, um, the, the,

280
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,090
the most famous fighter of the day,

281
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:55,070
some Irish men who was like
the champion of New York, uh,

282
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,670
said some stuff about him in the paper
and then they were having the Saint

283
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,670
Patrick's Day parade and Cornelius
was on horseback and the,

284
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:08,700
that fighter came out into the street
and he was pretty drunk and Cornelius got

285
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,550
off of his horse and punched
out the heavyweight champion.

286
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,230
And it's documented in the paper.
It's not like lore and uh, yeah.

287
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:19,350
Now that's the kind of tycoon
I want to read about. Exactly.

288
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,750
You don't see bill gates knocking anyone.

289
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:25,650
I'm not going to have Mike Tyson
Saint Patty's day. Exactly. If a, if,

290
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,180
if you know, Mark Zuckerberg
took out, you said,

291
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:35,040
what about my Gregor Macgregor? You
said, what about Facebook? How do I know?

292
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:39,240
Right? I'm Saudi. Saudi. No, come here.
I'm going to rip your ass publicly.

293
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,940
What's the rent? Take a break.
We're going to take a break.

294
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:45,090
Is that we take as a race on here.
We'd take breaks on this one.

295
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:50,040
Cause you know what? Okay, good. Let's
make some money. I have these cash cows.

296
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,920
Oh yeah, yeah. They are. Yeah.
To talk about that. Yeah.

297
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,210
We've been told it's a cash cow.
Just while you're sitting here,

298
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,670
put a ton of my own money into this and
I'm not seeing anything, man. All right,

299
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:03,510
we'll take a break.
Hold on.

300
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,763
Yeah,

301
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,530
and now for this segment, Conan O'brien
pays off the mortgage on his beach house.

302
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,630
Yeah. I hate to bore people with my
financial problems, but um, as you know,

303
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:23,130
I got a beach house but on a nice beach
and then took out a really big mortgage

304
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,940
and then took a loan on that mortgage
almost immediately then took a loan on

305
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:33,840
that loan. So, so many bad decisions. Yes,

306
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,400
I counted, uh, it's three bad
decisions in a very quick succession.

307
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,030
I'm okay.
Uh,

308
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,710
everyone's fine and kids are going to
eat and there's a roof over her head and

309
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:46,500
everything, but, um,
I need to get to work.

310
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,770
You need to make some money
and we must do that. Now,

311
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,590
Sony,
you're aware of how much I love to read.

312
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,600
You read constantly and you
kind of make fun of, you know,

313
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,380
the fact that I read a lot, I always
have like a giant book under my arm.

314
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,530
Call it nerd.
Okay.

315
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,600
It's a good way to mock someone for trying
to broaden their horizons. I do, I do.

316
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,400
I love books. I love reading. Uh, living
in Los Angeles soon your car a lot.

317
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,330
And for a long time I tried
reading while I was driving and uh,

318
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,950
just I was wreaking havoc just crashing
into things and that I don't recommend

319
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:30,900
that. Do not read novels and erotic
thrillers while you're driving,

320
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,730
but it's one of the reasons
that I truly do love audible.

321
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,700
I am a user of audible.
I,

322
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:44,180
I like audible because I love
listening to books while I'm driving.

323
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,430
Let's honest. You don't love reading
to you. I find it tedious. Um,

324
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,510
would you listen to an audible
book if I was narrating it?

325
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,380
Uh,
why you listen to your voice all the time?

326
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,930
What if you were listening to,
um,

327
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,060
like 50 shades of gray and I
was narrating it. That would be,

328
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,130
would it be like your nightmare?
That would be my absolute nightmare.

329
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,730
And it was so worse thing I could
ever subject myself to. Okay,

330
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,810
I don't see how any of this has anything
to do with audible. And I blame you.

331
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,460
And if you play back the tape,

332
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:20,650
you'll see that it was you
who brought up 50 shades

333
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,640
anyway. Yes, that's true. You do not love
to read, but you like to hear a book.

334
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,610
I do. I like information. Yeah. Well,

335
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,920
what's cool about audible is you can get
just an incredible selection of audio

336
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:39,700
books, bestsellers,
mysteries, thrillers, memoirs.

337
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,470
You can choose three titles every month.
You can listen on any device,

338
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,680
anytime, anywhere. You can listen at home.

339
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:51,700
You can listen at the gym was says at
the gym. I don't know how that works.

340
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,420
I don't know if I could listen
to a really intense book.

341
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,150
Um, while I was at the gym. Well, you
don't read light fare. You read like,

342
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,540
you know,
war and yeah,

343
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,080
I don't think I could read a detailed
account or listen to a detailed account of

344
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:12,700
the fall or are they the fight
for Stalin Grad? Say, um,

345
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,170
wow.
Uh,

346
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,320
I was doing a bench press or
jazzercise or sizing jazzers sizing.

347
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,310
That's my thing. No, anywhere you are,

348
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,960
you can listen to a audible check it out.
And uh,

349
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:32,520
they've got a great audio book library.
Get to keep that forever. So I'm,

350
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,240
I'm a believer inaudible.

351
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,170
I actually do listen to great
stuff while I'm driving.

352
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,150
So for a limited time,

353
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:44,020
you can get three months of
audible for just 695 a month,

354
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,200
six 95 a month.
That's very reasonable.

355
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:52,201
That's more than half off the regular
price of give yourself a gift.

356
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,580
Cause guess what?
It's that time of year,

357
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,970
the time of year when we think of
ourselves and give ourselves a gift.

358
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,590
That's the true meaning of the holidays.
Give yourself the gift of listening.

359
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:07,310
And while you're at it, think about
giving the gift of audible to a loved one.

360
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:07,941
A friend,

361
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:12,941
someone on that list from more go to
audible.com/conan O'Brien or text Conan

362
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,680
O'brien to 500 500.

363
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,300
And that leads me to this thought
that just popped into my head.

364
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,500
Everybody. Every business wants to
know what their customers are thinking,

365
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:33,380
what they care about.
And a,

366
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:37,530
if you've got a business you want to
meet my friends at campaign monitor,

367
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,480
I'll let me explain as best as I can.

368
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:42,510
Campaign monitor is an
email marketing platform.

369
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,370
It makes it easy to send emails
your customers care about.

370
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,380
I usually know I'm not tech savvy.
Right? What's an email? Okay,

371
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,110
so we're starting at the basics.
Yes. You're saying, okay,

372
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:57,740
so email is electronic mail.
You get on your computer. Okay.

373
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,840
I don't have a company so I don't know.
These are will you?

374
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,030
I don't think you're going to have
a company. What does that mean?

375
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:07,900
Why wouldn't I have a company? I
could have a company, I don't know.

376
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,170
You're way too laid back. I am laid back
here. Yeah. You're not starting a company,

377
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:15,260
but if I did have a company,
I would use campaign monitor.

378
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,290
Yeah. Well, campaign monitor. I'm,
I'm, again, this is what I'm told.

379
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,000
It's got helpful tools.

380
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,080
They have a drag and drop email builder
and they have a library of ready to go

381
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:25,920
templates.

382
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,980
So you can create a personal relational
email and automations and you can build

383
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:36,930
relationships with your customers leading
to more engagement and revenue for

384
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:40,980
your brand. I have a lot of
questions and if you have questions,

385
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:45,690
they have a friendly support system of
people who are available seven days a

386
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:48,600
week.
So I might just call them and say,

387
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:53,810
I just did an ad for you guys and I'd
like you to explain to me what this is and

388
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:58,860
you can sign up for and try out
their platform for free. No cards,

389
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,300
no contract.

390
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,250
So maybe the best way to find out what
this is is to just sign up and start

391
00:25:05,251 --> 00:25:05,970
using it.

392
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:06,650
Well,
you know,

393
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,650
if when I opened my company and I start
my company and I want to send out emails

394
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:15,750
to my customers to market the
products that I will eventually have,

395
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:19,470
this is the kind of platform I
will use in order to do that.

396
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,510
So I a company would you have,
you'd have,

397
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,630
it'd be something real
chill like beanbag chairs.

398
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,980
I sit that would be a cool company. I'd
have a really cool company. I'd be really,

399
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:31,350
do I think you're a cool person? You
know that right? I could start a company.

400
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:35,850
It takes, um, what's it called?
Work to start a company.

401
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,750
It also takes a great email marketing
platform and so I would use campaign

402
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:47,300
monitor, which are very
successful company. Whatever
that is. Go ahead. You know,

403
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,660
the best thing to do is check it out.
Yeah.

404
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,970
For yourself and go to
campaign monitor.com/conan.

405
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,103
Okay.

406
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,140
Campaign monitor.com/conan campaign
monitor or make your emails unforgettable.

407
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,080
That's um, a slogan. I just thought of.

408
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,160
Rebecca,
can you

409
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:14,150
hear with Dax Shepard? You really do
think we could be friends? Oh, absolutely.

410
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,960
You know, I really do. I know that
this is like kind of a comedic premise.

411
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,530
I recognize that it's a
bit of a comedic premise,

412
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,930
but it has some grain of truth in it.
Yeah.

413
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:28,730
I would like to discuss the real
of it. Yeah. If you're open to it,

414
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,180
I am.

415
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,710
Maybe you'll have to save this to episode
100 where you have a breakthrough or

416
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:36,230
something. Yeah. But in your mind,

417
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:39,530
when you think about the fact that you
haven't accumulated a bunch of friends in

418
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,800
show business,
my assumption is you think their fault.

419
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,340
Is that accurate? Nothing
is my fault. Well,

420
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:51,510
I mean it's very human to assume it's
the other person doesn't want to be

421
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:55,710
friends with you. Yeah. Is that your
assumption? I mean, sincere, uh,

422
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,290
if we're gonna do this sincere thing,
I have to change my tone of voice.

423
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,700
Maybe a different shirt to

424
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,920
get a whole wardrobe they ran in for
sincere wardrobe right now, something,

425
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:12,570
uh, I need something made of hemp.
Um, yeah, I would say it's a,

426
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,681
mostly,

427
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:18,450
I would say it's mostly comedic premise
and then there's a grain of truth,

428
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,520
but it more, it comes out. I actually
do not blame other people. I don't,

429
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,120
I don't, uh, if we're going to be
sincere, I don't blame other people. I,

430
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,260
I know that I have,
I spoke with your wife about this.

431
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,710
I'm really busy and I have a a wife and
two kids and I'm really involved with

432
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:38,970
them.

433
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,970
I had come from a big family and I do
have a set of friends and it's very hard

434
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:49,080
to get together with them.
It's really hard to make it happen.

435
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,020
You and I also live on
opposite sides of this city,

436
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:55,200
which shouldn't be a big deal,
but it actually is a gigantic deal.

437
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,340
If you're listening and you don't
know about Los Angeles, uh, you,

438
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:03,330
it takes 90 minutes for me to get to
Conan's house at the wrong time of day and

439
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:06,990
it's only 19 miles and
that's in a Leer jet. I mean

440
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,613
you have,

441
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,190
you have post apocalyptic cars
that can drive over other cars.

442
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,060
I've thought about just going straight
over the Santa Monica mountains to your

443
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:22,650
house in the off road vehicle and I'm
not ruling that out. You do it. Well,

444
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:27,150
if that fucking p 21 cougar could get
himself from there over to Griffith Park,

445
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:29,040
I assume. I must be able to. Yeah,

446
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,850
you can do it in your vehicles
needs a mobile ramps and stuff. Oh,

447
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,690
that's a problem. There's a couple
interesting things to explore, which is,

448
00:28:36,691 --> 00:28:39,210
one is that just might be you,
right?

449
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:43,350
You might not be ultra social and you
might be very satisfied being with your

450
00:28:43,351 --> 00:28:48,351
family and using all the time you're not
at work for your family and then that

451
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:50,910
would be fine,
but even if you were fine with it,

452
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,750
you'd have to relieve yourself of this
expectation that people should have a ton

453
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:58,260
of friends. Like you couldn't just
peacefully go, Oh, you know what?

454
00:28:58,261 --> 00:29:01,560
I'm just not that kind of person because
you inherently are innately just kind

455
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:04,620
of feel like, well, what's wrong
with me? Why don't I desire that?

456
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,090
But I wonder for you is do you desire
it or do you just not desire it?

457
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,470
I think two things.
I think one a,

458
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:16,800
and this is very hard
for people to believe,

459
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,230
but it's true of a lot of
people to get into comedy.

460
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,920
A lot of people get into comedy or
there's a strain of person that gets into

461
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:23,221
comedy.

462
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:27,440
And I think I fall into this category
where there's a bit of a shyness and

463
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,660
people don't believe that I'm
shy because I'm very verbal.

464
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:35,370
I really do like people, I like to talk
to them, but I am the kind of person who,

465
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:39,120
if I'm at home and I'm on the
second floor and the doorbell rings,

466
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,290
I'm really hoping my
wife gets it because I'm,

467
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,880
I need a little more,

468
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,630
like I need to ramp up to going
down and saying hi to someone. And,

469
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,560
and I don't think anyone listening to
this would believe that that's true.

470
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,050
But I do get a little shy.
And also when I'm,

471
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:01,110
when I'm in a restaurant and I see other
celebrities or people I've interviewed,

472
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,440
I'm,

473
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,070
I got to work up the nerve to a little
bit to go over there and say hi to them.

474
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,710
Right.
Because it's not my natural.

475
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,190
I always think people want to
be left alone. I, they don't,

476
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:15,320
I don't want to bother them. You
know, this is very Boston, have you,

477
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,230
but um,

478
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,830
what's kind of fascinating is,
um,

479
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,240
I two I didn't have social
anxiety my whole life. I'm very,

480
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,810
I was very social. I love going to
bars and stuff. Um, being famous,

481
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,263
uh,

482
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,630
resulted in me having social anxiety
weirdly enough because when I would meet

483
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:41,680
strangers I would feel,
and again I'm putting this all on myself,

484
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:44,410
they probably be just happy
to shake my hand that be that.

485
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,880
But I feel this obligation to deliver
something to them when I meet them.

486
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,920
I feel like from the
second we start talking,

487
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,180
it's on my shoulders to make this
a memorable, interesting exchange.

488
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,610
And quite often if we're at a public
place with a bunch of people, I don't,

489
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,870
I can't do that 45 times in one
night. And I start just thinking, oh,

490
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:07,500
that person left let down. Like, oh,

491
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:11,830
that guy isn't nearly as fun or gregarious
as he presents himself and Conan's

492
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:16,240
talk show.
So I feel like I have as a result of,

493
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,520
of being, you know what I mean? Like that
word. But yes, but being famous has, has,

494
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:25,570
eh, definitely increased my level of,
of social anxiety. That's interesting.

495
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,170
I don't, you know, you had it
on the same level before. Yeah,

496
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,000
I think I had a little bit of that. I
definitely had that shyness before. Um,

497
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,800
I do think to contrast myself with you,
uh,

498
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,693
I,

499
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,120
I do feel like people might expect me to
entertain them a little bit and I do it

500
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:52,630
for everybody. Sure.
I'm failing and Sonia,

501
00:31:52,631 --> 00:31:54,070
you can weigh in on this,

502
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:59,071
but if the guy comes to change the smoke
alarm in the house because you know,

503
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:00,250
uh,

504
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:05,250
I want that person to have a satisfactory
entertaining moment with Conan O'brien

505
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,630
and, and uh, if I'm at a party
for the 150 people and uh,

506
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:14,860
and at some function where I'm
supposed to talk to, uh, you know,

507
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,400
I'm supposed to mingle and talk to
them at some function for the network,

508
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:24,030
I will get to everybody and
I will give them my full,

509
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,840
it's been just fine. The platinum package,
I, everybody gets it. Everybody gets it.

510
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:33,010
And it's not a status thing. I do
it. I am running for something,

511
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:37,630
I'm running for some high office and
I don't even know what it's for. Well,

512
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:39,260
I know for me it is,

513
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:44,570
and this is something that I've
had to like really work at is um,

514
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:49,130
the notion that someone would walk
away and not like me is so painful.

515
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,840
My own ego of like someone, like
someone's going to walk away and go, oh,

516
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:58,430
he's an asshole in real life. I
find that to be, you know, painful.

517
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:01,610
The thought of. Yes.
But through having kids,

518
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,840
it has helped move me a little
bit closer to a healthy place,

519
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:10,220
which is I am generally quite nice if
you meet me out in the rest of are a nice

520
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:14,810
guy. If I'm with my kids, I'm not
very nice because it's their time.

521
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:15,980
It's no one else's time.

522
00:33:15,981 --> 00:33:19,810
So before at the airport and people want
to take pictures and stuff with us, I,

523
00:33:19,811 --> 00:33:23,360
I'm, I'm not mean, but I'm very direct
in that this is their time. Yup.

524
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,430
And I have had to become comfortable
with the notion that, Yup,

525
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:32,900
some people on planet earth are going to
leave you and say that guy's a Dick and

526
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:36,140
tell people that I'll never meet that
I'm a dick and I just have to get

527
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:40,160
comfortable with that because my priority
is these two little girls and I got to

528
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:41,810
live with that and you can't control that.

529
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,140
And also you can give
them everything they want,

530
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,790
but if it's a better story later on in a
cocktail party that you're a dick. Yes.

531
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,080
Then you're a dick.

532
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:56,110
And so and so you just talk to the
person for 15 minutes to try and convince

533
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:58,850
them that you're a good guy, good
person. And then you bought them.

534
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,720
I'm going to try all airport, uh,
you know, and carried their bags,

535
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:06,160
gift shop and carry their bags. But then
they're like, yeah, I met him. I Dunno.

536
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,220
It seems like kind of a Dick.

537
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:09,790
And that's their story for the rest of
their life because frankly on her store,

538
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,960
it's a more fun story. Um, let's
get to this because really quick,

539
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:16,430
I just love when you were on my show.

540
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:20,330
He corrected my English like six or
seven times and I just said funner.

541
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,980
And as it was coming out of my mouth,
I go,

542
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,620
he's not going to roll with
that and just match my,

543
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,820
or he's going to say more fun, which
is correct. I don't did, I don't have,

544
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:32,450
isn't it crazy how lightening
fast these thoughts happen? Well,

545
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,560
from her and in the moment those
two syllables came out of my mouth,

546
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,130
I felt insecure. I thought about
what you were going to do a,

547
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,960
all this stuff happened.
That's where it,

548
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:44,930
cause I just instantly felt pity for you.
Same Shit.

549
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,780
Let's get to this. We just got to
get it out of the way. Oh, okay. Uh,

550
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:55,040
I made an attempt, a good hearted
attempt. I came out of my shell,

551
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,490
I reached out to and I said, let's,
uh, after he would suggested it,

552
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,230
let's really make this double date happen,
but oh, that's insufficient. Hold on.

553
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:08,360
That's not sufficient. Hold
on. Okay, go ahead. You, uh,

554
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,920
I, I put out there, uh, how
about three, four, no, none.

555
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,260
And I'm not letting you proceed.
Your, your, your, your timeline.

556
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:18,290
You've jumped way too far
ahead. Okay. So here's what's,

557
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,210
here's what really happened, which is
I've been on your show 350 times. Yeah.

558
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,250
We get along great on your show.
We have a great chemistry. Yes.

559
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:28,400
Some of my finest chemistry is
shared with you and my wife.

560
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,070
That is a very specific rapport we have.
Yes.

561
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:38,280
And I ran into you in Santa Barbara
at a party and we started talking.

562
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,840
Yeah. And there I discovered you
love history and I love history.

563
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,080
So we started really talking
about history. It was whole bunch.

564
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,610
It was fun to our wives.

565
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,580
Total erotic fantasy come true. Yeah. Um,

566
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:57,630
they weren't, they weren't
touching themselves as, as
we were discussing grants.

567
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,520
Second term. Yes. So in that moment, uh,

568
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:06,990
also that you ride bicycles,
you ride motorcycles, so
that now we discovered, oh,

569
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:09,960
we could be real life friends. Right.
I just, I think that's relevant.

570
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,530
It's not like on the 29th appearance
on your talk show. You were like, Hey,

571
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:14,490
let's hang.
No,

572
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,070
and we talked about maybe getting together
and we tried to make it happen a few

573
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:20,100
times and then I just get her to do a
real three dimensional human being that I

574
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:23,580
would be interested in hanging out with.
But those, is that a surprise to you?

575
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,210
Absolutely. I meet you on
a talk show. Yeah. Yeah.

576
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:31,380
You have a persona during the talk show.

577
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,520
Is it that different from who I am and
really you do a different voice like I

578
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:39,960
don't know, every two
minutes now if you imagine,

579
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:43,110
I mean someone over for dinner who's
going to do a different voice every two

580
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:46,770
minutes? Let me in. I can entertain you.

581
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,890
I'm one it those mashed potatoes I lesson.

582
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,290
That was my catch phrase for
94 those mashed potatoes.

583
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:58,620
That was my catch phrase in 94 slash
95 one of those mashed potatoes.

584
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,440
It was a big thing.
Then look it up.

585
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,110
It was just as that was during
friends for a season. Here we go.

586
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,910
I put out how about three 14 three
15 or three 24 you right back.

587
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:10,020
You're really excited.

588
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:13,980
And you say three 15 I love that
you're saying your exact sentences,

589
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,090
but paraphrasing mind.

590
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,510
I don't feel like this is just
at all cause I have the same,

591
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:21,600
I have the same shit on my phone
that I also brought. Okay. Listen,

592
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,370
I'm half of this print it out on pieces of
paper, which makes me better. Okay. The,

593
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:31,371
so we established that the date would
be three 15 now you're a history buff.

594
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,550
March 15th the ides of
March. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

595
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:40,410
What happened on the Julius Caesar
was stabbed by Marc Antony. Um, right.

596
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,300
It was a Brutus Brutus
stabbed him. Brutus. Yeah.

597
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:49,290
Brutus Stamp Mark Antony. I don't take
Mark Anthony. Like how I'm saying Antony.

598
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,790
Antony was his only friend, right?
Yeah. Well but Brutus was a friend.

599
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:57,420
March 15th is a famous state
that when it goes sideways,

600
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,780
when not just that when a man is betrayed
by someone he thought was his friend.

601
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,890
Yeah. Okay. The ides
of March. Okay, great.

602
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,880
So you write me back and here's,

603
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,240
you better read this shit verbatim
because I have it. I have it right here.

604
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,790
I actually was delighted.
So again,

605
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,710
I'm going to interject because
I'm the fucking did this.

606
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,460
Then I let you talk more when you were on
my show. So let me talk for one second.

607
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,710
Oh, here we go. Hold up. Let
a sense stones here though.
You're pissed. Order order.

608
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,760
So your pistol quiet. Clearly.
I've got him on the road. Okay,

609
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,240
go says I'm doing voices all the
time. A teen, true. Like Tatiana,

610
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,820
attain TrueCar. I'm secure. I
don't need to entertain constantly.

611
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,260
You say perfect.
I'll start fasting now.

612
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,680
Three 15 march 15 exclamation point.

613
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,530
Okay. Your friend is telling you to
flip the page. Uh, that's not my friend.

614
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:53,860
This is like watching your 90 year old
grandma kick your ass. It's laborious.

615
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,320
Then I reached out to you on the
15th and say, Hey, is this happening?

616
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,600
You get back to me and the only
reason I bring this up here as well,

617
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:06,670
or I insist you now go verbatim, which
I'm now holding the same script as you.

618
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,270
Okay, go ahead. Okay, let me do my
part. You read new because by the way,

619
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:12,970
when I looked this up to find out
who was right or who was wrong,

620
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,920
and you'll soon learn I was wrong.
I can admit that that's all I wanted.

621
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,780
I was upset to see that I was wrong.

622
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,960
But then it was delighted by our
exchange because it really delivered.

623
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,150
You're very funny in your exchange.
And I say one thing just before him.

624
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,170
The only reason I bring this up
and being so such a stickler,

625
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:34,171
is it an I did your podcast and I said
you canceled day up and you insisted that

626
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:39,160
it was impossible that
you would cancel day of.

627
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,350
So I went back into the files as did I.

628
00:39:42,351 --> 00:39:47,230
And when I realized that
you cancel day of I dance,

629
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,950
I orgasm for the first time in four years,

630
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,480
mostly done mixing. Most mostly
dust came out some lint. Yeah,

631
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:59,350
Lynn and a a a Lincoln Penny.
So my friend Conan inquires,

632
00:39:59,351 --> 00:40:02,350
whether or not we're on for that night.
And here's my response.

633
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,460
So when we made these plans
and I picked this date,

634
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:08,320
I knew I was shooting a Sitcom,

635
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:12,520
but at the time they told me we would
shoot live on Fridays in front of an

636
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:13,270
audience.

637
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,140
Then I got the schedule last night and
learned I will be shooting stuff tonight

638
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:17,974
as well.

639
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,720
For some weird reason I'm attaching it I
guess because it's very important to me

640
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,100
that you know,
I'm not lying,

641
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:28,960
which in and of itself probably d'oeuvre
deserves some exploration. At any rate,

642
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:31,890
I'm very bummed that this is the
case and I hope we can reschedule.

643
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:36,400
Don't give up on me. Dad. Interesting.
You made me your father. Uh Huh.

644
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,290
That's right. And I did attach
the, the, the, the schedule.

645
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:45,050
Would you by the way, literally did
come up the night before. So yes,

646
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:49,720
I couldn't have really done a better job
because I just found out basically when

647
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:53,560
you found out, I understand not to excuse
it, I still canceled on you day off.

648
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:56,170
But can I, are you gonna read
your response or can I read yours?

649
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,980
I don't think it's, yours is
great. So you say, you say Dax,

650
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,340
I called your line producer and
you aren't even in the cast.

651
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,330
He said you never got the role and haven't
worked in months. You need help man.

652
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,700
No problem.
Let's do it some other time.

653
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,080
It's not like I'm terminally
ill or anything off to the
doctor now Conan, right.

654
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,420
This is a brilliant response.

655
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,810
And then I respond Hahahahaha
I give you like nine hah. Aha.

656
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,620
You know how funny I thought it was quote,
I called your line producer.

657
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,450
I'm even quoting you. Yeah, you wrote
back, I was told that's a thing. Yeah,

658
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,830
a little self deprecation at the end.

659
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,330
Now I look at that as a big victory
for both of us. It wasn't a victory.

660
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,900
And you know what? I wasn't upset.
I wasn't upset. The only reason I'm,

661
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,840
we're talking about this now is that
you insisted by, we never had cast that.

662
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:45,860
You would never do that.

663
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:50,360
And I just had to set the record
straight that on the ides of March,

664
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:51,530
you stabbed me in the back.

665
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:56,480
I did once you bleed on the steps
and the vote on the Senate floor. Um,

666
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,880
but no, it is, you know, it is,

667
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,970
we're going to get together and you and
I are going to talk about history and

668
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:03,440
maybe the ladies can't be,

669
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,020
maybe the ladies can't be there if
we're going to talk about history.

670
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,130
Well that's the other most predictable
outcome of our night at the farmer's

671
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:14,060
daughter hotel is that you and I probably
will just start passionately rolling

672
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:18,790
around in the, in the binding of
a grant biography. Yes, exactly.

673
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,870
Marrying the pages on his said,

674
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,800
uh,
listen,

675
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,510
I gotta say that was probably my favorite
moment you and I ever had on your show

676
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:33,590
was I was going through
what I think I am out of 10.

677
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,870
Do you recall this? You probably
don't. I do. I'm a six but, but,

678
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,480
but lucky for us men,

679
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,600
women subconsciously average your
personality in your looks and that's what

680
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:50,630
they're seeing. So I was telling
you, well, my personality is a Tan.

681
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,940
It looks for a six. Thank God my wife sees
an eight when I walk in the door. Yeah.

682
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,090
And then you said to me,
what am I? And I said, well,

683
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:03,260
your looks or a five and you came
unglued. And I'm like, well, hold on,

684
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:06,370
I'm only giving myself six. Do you
remember that? And that was really cool.

685
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,850
It was a five. I still don't understand.
There's no comedy. If I say six,

686
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:11,781
there's comedy.

687
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:16,781
If I say you want to lower the whole
thing was that you're being sincere on

688
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:19,400
podcasts.
I am on your show.

689
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:23,510
I'm a liar and an instigator
and a provocate tour. Right.

690
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:27,530
But marriage challenge, all those guys.
What am I, we're on the podcast now.

691
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,320
I think you and I are very comparable.
I think you're a six.

692
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,890
I think I'm higher than that. Okay. What
do you think you are okay. I've got,

693
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,250
first of all,
I think if I got a few things fixed,

694
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,870
not the listen to me.
I have host makeover assessment.

695
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:48,080
I have fin, unattractive lips. Get those
plumped out. Okay. I have rat. Like guys,

696
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:53,081
I have BDI and I have an eye vein
that shows up on camera and uh,

697
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,890
and I, if I could get those things,
I have killer hair. I haven't,

698
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,670
I'm a 12 when it comes to, well, you
can't go over 10. Okay. I'm a 10 in hair.

699
00:44:03,671 --> 00:44:08,570
Okay. Uh, I've got, uh, I've work out.
My body is in pretty good shape. It is.

700
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:13,220
Yeah. And I give myself from my age, I'm
going to give myself an eight on that. Uh,

701
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:14,990
but yeah, I got to get
ready out. Go Higher.

702
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:19,490
I'd say if we're just talking your
physique at 55, you're at nine. Okay.

703
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:23,650
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So you're
saying my grade down shit,

704
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:27,980
my face drags me down to a, well, no,
I'm not, I'm not averaging your body.

705
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:31,320
I'm just going with your face
and your personality. Okay.

706
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,760
What's wrong with the personality?
It's great. It's a 10. He's a 10.

707
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,910
Your looks are five key guilty.
It makes you a 7.5.

708
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,990
I've only got you by 0.5 in my scenario.
I don't,

709
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:46,710
you don't accept that it's good for you.
You've got a competitive flair.

710
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,470
I got to fix this thing. We got it. You,

711
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,020
I gotta really some fillers it
sounds like is what you want.

712
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,980
You want some fillers in your lips? I
want lips filler. I have to have the eyes,

713
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:56,280
uh,

714
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,450
opened up a little bit cause when I looked
from sign up to go to Asia for that,

715
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,900
that's a procedure that's done.
I, when I look from side to side,

716
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,040
I look like one of those.

717
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,710
I looked like a rat looking around to
see if the room is safe to enter and I

718
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,140
want that to go away. Okay.
We can fix that. Yeah.

719
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,690
And you can see my veins
through my skin because of my,

720
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,470
my Pale that we're stuck with.

721
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:20,400
Unless you want to wear an eye patch
because they can't make your skin thicker.

722
00:45:20,401 --> 00:45:22,350
To my knowledge,
I was thinking of having the,

723
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:26,730
I moved but then I found out that it
supplies most of the blood to my brain.

724
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,920
Okay.
Then let's not do that.

725
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,130
Although you know what you could do is
you could use this great product Latiece

726
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:35,490
that women use to make
their eyelashes thicker.

727
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:38,580
I think if we got your
eyelashes so thick and powerful,

728
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,600
it could distract from that vein you don't
like. Okay. What do you think of that?

729
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,930
I'll do it. Okay, great. I think
what we took away from all of this,

730
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:49,770
and maybe this is why, I dunno,
you sorta gave away the ending too.

731
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:54,270
Maybe this whole podcast, which is
that I may not want a lot of friends.

732
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:58,980
I have a couple of friends who are
really good friends and I have, uh,

733
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:04,220
I have friends that go back 35 years
who I talked to all the time once,

734
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:08,400
twice a week. Yeah. I'm really
close with those people.

735
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:12,430
You're also someone who historically has,
uh,

736
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,460
remained friends with people you've worked
with think is a pretty good sign. Yes.

737
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:21,570
Oh No. I'm a loyal friend. I
just, I don't think I'm looking,

738
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,110
that's why you've ruined this
podcast. I try. I'm hoping to,

739
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,750
I don't think at the end of the day,

740
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:32,730
I would love to hang with you
whenever we can make that happen,

741
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,990
but I don't think I'm looking for a lot
of celebrity friends and I think we have

742
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:40,800
to change the name of the podcast. Well,
do they have to be celebrity friends?

743
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,430
What's the point of having a regular
friend while at celebrity front and bring

744
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:47,630
up, you bring up a good point. It's
going to sound terrible, but I'm,

745
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,040
I do very well with the common man.
Aw,

746
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:55,820
I'm sure that's what the guy who installed
your smoke detector told them in the

747
00:46:55,911 --> 00:47:00,230
hallway. He was doing some
work here. So I said, hey,

748
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:03,560
they had common man.
I know you are applied.

749
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:11,120
Did you have any problem getting
your mule up the driveway? All right,

750
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:14,600
we got to wrap this right. You are a,
you're an ex new feel how much I like,

751
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,560
you know,
I keep trying to make this go longer.

752
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:19,440
Do you feel me trying to make this go
longer because it's more time with you.

753
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:23,540
I do and it's pushing me away. I'm going
to feel needy. Yeah, it's going to,

754
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:27,090
it's coming out. It's a
very neat. Okay. Um, but uh,

755
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:31,420
loved this so much. Also, I'm, I
can't believe this hasn't come up yet.

756
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:35,110
You are a, you have, you're
killing it in the podcast world.

757
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:39,690
So I am absolutely thrilled that
you and that you took the time to,

758
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,590
to come here and do this because
this is your, this is your main ta.

759
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,400
I don't know what that word means.
It's not French. She said correctly.

760
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:49,390
It sounds like Matt and Matt,

761
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:54,220
like the Latin format may be seen as
something I do in the afternoons. Okay.

762
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:58,150
No, this is just, this is
what you do. You've, uh,

763
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,360
you took to it like a duck to water
that hadn't been in water before,

764
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:04,750
but then immediately like the water. All
right. God bless you. You're a good man.

765
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:07,300
I love you Conan O'brien. I
love you too. Dax Shepard.

766
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,990
And now another segment of Conan O'brien
pays off the mortgage on his beach

767
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:17,824
house.

768
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:23,931
Give it's okay.

769
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:28,830
So now I'd like to talk about a sensitive
issue if that's cool with you. Um,

770
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,190
it's about guys in a
certain health problem,

771
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,940
but not going to say this as
delicately as I can, but, uh,

772
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:39,390
it's erectile dysfunction. You
know, that's something that, uh,

773
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:42,650
some men struggle with.
You know,

774
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:44,840
guys feel awkward discussing it.

775
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:47,960
I feel awkward discussing it
right now because we're, I mean,

776
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,260
first of all because I'm discussing
it here and you're my assistant.

777
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:55,280
That's strange. But also I feel a little
awkward debt in this room right now.

778
00:48:55,281 --> 00:48:58,850
There's about 150 people. I don't know
why we have that many people in here.

779
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:04,310
It seems, it seems silly. You're also,
you're a repressed Irish Catholic.

780
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,400
Yes. And very repressed. I
don't discuss sexual matters.

781
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,170
That has never been my way and uh, but
this is something we should talk about.

782
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:13,910
It's something that's
healthy to talk about.

783
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,940
A lot of guys out there
have trouble with Ed and uh,

784
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:24,010
there's this product Roman that's created
an easy way to get checked out by a

785
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:29,141
doctor and then get treated for
erectile dysfunction on the line.

786
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:33,710
And let me just say something as a
guide and please let me be very clear.

787
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:37,490
I have not had this issue myself yet.
Could happen anytime now,

788
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:41,870
but it's hard to discuss
this with anybody.

789
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:46,930
There have been times where I've been
talking to a doctor and I haven't wanted

790
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:49,700
to bring up,
hey,

791
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:53,480
what if I someday need that a
drug for rectal dysfunction.

792
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,500
So what I try and do is pretend I'm
talking about a head cold, you know,

793
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:02,230
like I've got a really bad head cold and
it's really bad and I'm worried someday

794
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:07,250
the head cold might give me Ed and
then he says, do you want an Ed drug?

795
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,550
And I'm like, no man, I don't need
that. Just talking about my head cold.

796
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,400
So it goes through all these
different and I don't even have it.

797
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,910
You keep saying you don't have it.
It's me.

798
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,860
It's making me think you might
have it and I might have it. Well,

799
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:21,470
if I was a guy and I had this,
I wouldn't want to,

800
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,880
I would just want to do it like take
care of it quietly. Really? Yeah.

801
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,070
You wouldn't want to put
an ad the paper and said,

802
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:30,140
I have erectile dysfunction
is anybody know what to do?

803
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:33,790
And then a picture of yourself, is
that what you did? We didn't want,

804
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:38,030
she was mistake. Hmm. Point
is there's no waiting rooms.

805
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,890
There's no awkward face to face where
you say to the doctor or your dentist or

806
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:46,430
whoever you're going to,
I need an erectile dysfunction drug.

807
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,480
I had a guy fitting me for a ThoughtWorks
once the shoe store and I said,

808
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,930
can you get me, uh, an
erectile dysfunction drug?

809
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,800
I was escorted out of the shoe store
very quickly. Anyway, a handle,

810
00:50:57,801 --> 00:51:00,200
everything online.
All you have to do is visit.

811
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:04,610
Get roman.com/conan that's right.
My dreams fulfilled.

812
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:08,780
Fill out a brief medical onboarding,
chat with a doctor,

813
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,760
get FDA approved,

814
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:15,470
erectile dysfunction meds
delivered to your door discreetly.

815
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,320
Maybe even could put
something else on the package.

816
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,280
Here's that drug you need to keep
you from having a constant direction.

817
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:28,100
Would that be great? Like, yeah,
man, I'm just ready to go 24,

818
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:33,101
seven and it's a problem because I work
literally around Hummel figurines and

819
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:37,700
I'm always smashing them,
man.

820
00:51:37,701 --> 00:51:41,660
Even Gorley's laughing at this one
was hard to get too specific. I know,

821
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:45,830
but you work at, at Hummel figurines
store, you've got a constant erection.

822
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,360
You turn, what's that smash.
But is it to my rights smash?

823
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:54,050
You just broke 35 little Hummel figurines,

824
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,200
poor little alpine boy and
later hose and hiking up a hill.

825
00:51:57,410 --> 00:52:01,400
He knew what he knew what he
was in for a and that's it.

826
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:04,010
That's an idea of Roman wants to use that.
Go ahead and use it,

827
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,580
but actually I'm all joking aside.
I think this is a, you know,

828
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:10,190
sounds like a good idea.

833
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:37,010
Tried to think of a slogan. Roman,
it's time to have an erection.

834
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,430
I don't see what's wrong with that.
Roman,

835
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:44,660
can you imagine if we got like
James Earl Jones to say that Roman,

836
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,990
it's time to have an erection again.
That's a good,

837
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:50,090
I don't see anything wrong with that.

838
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:54,110
That tells you exactly what's happening
with this product. You're welcome, Roman.

839
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,750
You can have that for free.
God,

840
00:52:56,751 --> 00:53:00,110
I don't understand how you
make money in this business.

841
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:04,760
He's drawing pictures of erections
on his head. Copy. In all fairness,

842
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:08,170
those pictures of erections were drawn
long before I read this Ad. All right.

843
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,300
You know, some artists
work in clay, some in oils.

844
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,120
I draw your reactions.
All right,

845
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:19,121
well you want some Clinton really happy
about right now my parents don't know

846
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:20,150
how to get a podcast.

847
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,700
Hi everyone.
This is Matt again.

848
00:53:28,701 --> 00:53:31,880
So there's some things slightly unique
with this one and that you guys have semi

849
00:53:31,881 --> 00:53:34,130
concrete plans to actually
hang out as friends.

850
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:36,920
Do you think that that actually
going to happen? Yeah, I do for sure.

851
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,360
I have a lot of shortcomings, but I
am an, again, March 15th excluded.

852
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,010
I am a man of my word.

853
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:46,480
It did seem like you took great pains
to show how stressed you are that I

854
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:51,140
included a document when I my
comment, right? Yeah. Yeah.

855
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:56,141
So I definitely think we will hang out
sooner or later he'll move east or I'll

856
00:53:56,781 --> 00:54:00,440
move west. There's no way we'll
end our lives separated like this.

857
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:04,850
You'll do it for each other. No, no. But
just by some other set of circumstance,

858
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:09,590
you've gone deeper than anyone else
that's far, so thank you for that. Okay,

859
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:10,603
thank you.

860
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,990
Sana? Yes. It's time to play
a little game. We call true
or false with sona much.

861
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,050
[inaudible] y'all said not really. Okay,
here we go. We were just a on tour.

862
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,760
Of course, Conan working hard. I'd go out
and I do my, you know, 40 minutes up top.

863
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:35,390
Then I go out at the end.
I'm working hard going city to city,

864
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:39,830
18 city tour a year there do
help me out too. Or false.

865
00:54:39,831 --> 00:54:44,540
You left me on the last leg of the
tour you took off. True or false?

866
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:49,670
True. Ben, did you leave me
with anyone to help me? No.

867
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:53,360
You left me alone? Yes. Would you
like to talk about that at all?

868
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:57,860
Did you feel bad about it? No.
Okay. I don't feel bad about it.

869
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:02,861
She took off and then it was up to me
to carry on by myself and it was tough.

870
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:07,130
I'm not trying to make you feel
guilty or anything, but if I were you,

871
00:55:07,131 --> 00:55:07,970
I'd feel a lot of guilt.

872
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,470
At first. I liked how you, you
said a code and working hard.

873
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,240
I just have to get that
out to any of this.

874
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:21,590
Like talking in the third person
when I hear you talk about this,

875
00:55:21,591 --> 00:55:22,430
I just here,

876
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:27,490
you're so valuable that when you
leave there's a hole in my life.

877
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,010
That's a nice way to look at it. And
you know what? You are valuable to me.

878
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:35,930
So when you left, um, I thought,
I hope this is for a good reason.

879
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,380
Where'd you go? I went to
a wedding. Whose wedding?

880
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,510
I went to my friend on I his wedding.

881
00:55:41,511 --> 00:55:45,770
My friend [inaudible] and Roger
got married in London. In London.

882
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,790
She a close relative? No.
Oh no, she's a friend.

883
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:54,020
You just went to a friend's wedding. I
went to a friend's wedding. Yeah, I did.

884
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,670
Did you think at all?

885
00:55:55,671 --> 00:55:58,640
Maybe I shouldn't go because I'm
with Conan on this important tour.

886
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,760
Do you want me to be honest?
Of course.

887
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:05,930
I didn't think about it at all.
I also,

888
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,110
I don't even know if I told you that I
wasn't going to be there until like you

889
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:14,070
did like a day before he
did.

890
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:18,110
And that's another point. You didn't
say anything to me like, you know,

891
00:56:18,111 --> 00:56:20,960
a month from now because you had
to buy tickets to go to London.

892
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:25,690
You had to make big arrangements to go.
You didn't say anything to me.

893
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:29,230
You just day before like, Oh yeah, I'm
not here tomorrow. You're on your own.

894
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,950
Good luck getting all
of your shit together.

895
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:37,270
Good luck with your tour.
Laughy chimpy boy.

896
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,310
And then you took off and you donate.
Who is this person?

897
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:46,620
I've never even heard her name before.
Laughy chimpy boy. No, Nas. Who's nae?

898
00:56:46,621 --> 00:56:50,350
So I don't even know her. Her. She's
a friend of mine every time. Oh God,

899
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:54,230
you have so many fives.
Real popular. I know, but,

900
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:59,020
but sometimes I think you throw around
the term friend a little loosely because

901
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:02,950
you're just like, oh yeah, she's my
friend. They got to go to London.

902
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:06,500
Did you really have to go right now?

903
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:12,250
Do you think you made the right call?
Yes. I don't regret it even for a second.

904
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:16,750
I uh, uh, yeah, I do. You
should. You should not be a lot.

905
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:22,210
So what I really did was you like
having rifts where you make fun of how

906
00:57:23,621 --> 00:57:27,490
terrible I am at my job. So I just
stepped away from that for a few days.

907
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,690
So if you're asking me,
hey,

908
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:32,950
did you miss me making fun
of you incessantly for a
few days so you could go to

909
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:35,460
London for a wedding?
A Ah,

910
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:40,910
it wasn't a hard decision to make it
all. Okay. Quick question. You left,

911
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,660
left me in the lurch.
Uh,

912
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:48,070
but then you said that you were
going to be back for the next,

913
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,520
the show at the start of the next
part of the leg, which was in Chicago.

914
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,940
Were you there in time
to go with us to Chicago?

915
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,430
No, that's right. You weren't.
What, what happened there?

916
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:02,710
My flight got canceled.

917
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,790
Could you leave a little buffer there
for that flight back so you can get back

918
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:10,180
to you? Important job? No, I want
you to maximize my time in London.

919
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,220
So I booked the fight for
the morning of the show.

920
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:17,410
You booked the flight in London for the
morning of my show in Chicago that you

921
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,740
were supposed to be at and then,
oops. Oh, that didn't work out.

922
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,620
You're on your own again.
Chimpy boy.

923
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:30,190
But it my defense. Do you make fun
of me a lot? I do. I'm good at it.

924
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:34,030
It might be the thing I'm best at now.
Now listen,

925
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:37,310
let's make sure that we're honest here.
Do you make fun of me a lot? Yes I do.

926
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,700
It's what I'm best at.
I think we are both.

927
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:44,050
I think in each other we have the person.

928
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,580
Isn't it crazy that the person your best
make it making fun of in the world is

929
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:51,970
Conan O'brien and the person I'm best
at making fun of in the world is sort of

930
00:58:51,971 --> 00:58:56,110
assessing and then we happened to meet.
Yes. And we happen to work together.

931
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,620
This is like Lennon Meeting Mccartney.
It's magical.

932
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:01,960
I don't understand that reference at all.
I'm sorry.

933
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,310
They were singers a long before
there were, uh, you know,

934
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:10,150
apps and spo that Lennon
and McCarthey McCartney.

935
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:15,130
Wait, did you think I was talking about
Vladimir Lenin and Joel and Joe McCarthy?

936
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:19,240
Yes. Yeah, you're right. You know what
you're like, you're like, you're like,

937
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:23,960
I'm Vladimir Lenin and
you were red baiting

938
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:29,880
redbaiting Cami Hunter. Joe McCarthy.
Yes. Perfect. It's perfect analogy.

939
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:33,920
We're the perfect analogy Carthy
and I was like Lennon, him,

940
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:37,610
Ricardo and understand that her leash,
oh my God,

941
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,930
this is great. I actually think
we're perfect as you know what?

942
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:46,730
Let's leave it that way.
Vladimir Lenin and Joseph McCarthy,

943
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,590
that's what we are together.

944
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:53,490
So one of us has a stroke at a pretty
young age and the other one dies of

945
00:59:53,491 --> 00:59:56,960
alcoholism. I'm happy you're
going to be the stroke one.

946
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:08,190

This has been 18 cocoa
production in association with,

960
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,790
Hey, this is Arnie from the comedy
podcasts. Hello from the magic tavern,

961
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:12,870
a chat show I host from the magical land
of food with my cohost use at all the

962
01:01:12,871 --> 01:01:17,280
blue wizard and chunk the shape shifter.
Most weeks we interview adventurers,

963
01:01:17,281 --> 01:01:21,360
wedding planners, ambulatory trees, but
this week we have a special episode.

964
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:26,460
I am so excited to learn about the
Earth Law in pride and prejudice.

965
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,520
We're going to do a book
club up pride and prejudice.

966
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:32,560
And you said this is a well
of both on earth, right? Yeah.

967
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:36,180
It's one of those books that people love
or were forced to read or more likely

968
01:01:36,181 --> 01:01:38,160
it's one of those,
I'm going to get to it,

969
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:41,910
and some of our most beloved of guests
are rich hurting to read the book with us

970
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:46,000
and enjoy some drinks and food. Have a
book club. We are flower. We have chrome,

971
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:48,600
the barbarian and girl.
You know who they are.

972
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:52,110
Maybe you don't give a crap about what
an academic thinks about Jane Austen,

973
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:55,380
but don't you want to know what a
wizard and a badge or think about it.

974
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,670
Not enough spells, not enough,
not enough sword fights.

975
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,390
Whether you love pride and prejudice or
have no interest in reading it and just

976
01:02:03,391 --> 01:02:06,240
want to listen to a book club
going really off the rails.

977
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,900
You'll enjoy this week's hello from the
magic tavern. We shall defeat this book.
