1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:03,560
Sonja,

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,340
has your husband ever been rushing out
the door and he's wanted to shave his

3
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:10,600
back, but he didn't have the time.
He didn't have the time to do it.

4
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:14,860
Shave his back. I am uncomfortable talking
about my husband's grooming habits.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,380
Well, that's a yes.
This is the cool thing.

6
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:22,381
There's a device called the back blade
2.0 it's the ultimate man grooming tool

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,700
and it would allow your
husband, if he shaved his back,
he could do it in minutes,

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,400
so if you had an appointment or someplace
he had to be and wanted to shave his

9
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:34,390
back. Done. Know what I'm
saying? It offers a clean,

10
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:39,100
close shave more so than other
bodily groomers and get this,

11
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:42,070
the unique patented dry glide blades.

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,870
It allows him to shave with or without
shaving cream and water. That's great.

13
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:49,930
That really cuts down on the time because
how do you put shaving cream on your

14
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:53,440
back? Oh, trust me. You have to get other
men involved. That's what I've done.

15
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,980
You meet people though.
Anyway, this Christmas,

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,280
tell your man to ditch that
ugly Christmas sweater,

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,390
which I guess refers to his body
hair the heck I've never anyway.

18
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:09,391
And get him a back blade 2.0 available
at [inaudible] dot com that's B a k B a l

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,640
a d.com.
They forced me to spell.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,270
Obviously everybody knows now
that you cannot drink and drive.

21
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,070
There are probably people that think
it's okay to drive when you're stoned.

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,710
They just think, well, I'll
probably just drive a little slower.

23
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,000
But that's not the case. Your
reaction time is affected. Um,

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,610
when you're high and you're
putting yourself in danger,

25
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:42,260
you're putting other people in danger.
So just a quick no joking around message,

26
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:46,280
don't kid yourself. If you've
been using marijuana in any form,

27
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:49,730
do not get behind the wheel.
Um, if you feel different,

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,750
you actually drive different. It's just
that simple. And this is something I'm,

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,120
I'm very serious about.
If you drive high,

30
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:59,750
you're going to get a Dui
and much scary than that.

31
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,380
You can end up really hurting
someone, uh, yourself included.

32
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,540
So just a reminder.

33
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,070
Hi,
my name is Nick Offerman

34
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,840
and my name is Megan Mullally.

35
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,853
Hmm.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,710
And I,
I dunno about you,

37
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:25,690
but I feel ambivalent about
being Conan O'Brien's friend.

38
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,300
I felt really good about it.
I hope to,

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,580
hey,
welcome to Conan O'brien needs a friend.

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,200
This is the podcast where I Conan talk
to people I've interviewed over the years

41
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:00,190
on my TV job.
Try and figure

42
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,480
out what's really the deal with us.
Are we friends? He said all fake.

43
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,720
What's really happening? And I'm
joined in this quest, if you will,

44
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,740
by a among Saskia and my
assistant and a podcast.

45
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:16,030
Extraordinary Ian, if that's even
a word. Matt Gorley. Hi. Okay.

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,980
And today I'm talking to two
of my favorite people ever.

47
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,780
I absolutely adore them.

48
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,300
Megan Mullally and nick off.

49
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,710
I do think of all the
people I've talked to,

50
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,400
we are legitimate legitimately friends.

51
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,830
We have gone out socially many times.
What was that noise you made?

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,820
You made a noise. It was, it was
involuntary. What the hell was it?

53
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,730
You seem skeptical about this whole thing.
Let's just,

54
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,070
let's just keep chatting.

55
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:58,000
You were saying were we've
gone out many times. Several,

56
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,990
I wouldn't say Manny, we've
gone out many times. Okay.

57
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,820
We got many times. Uh,
going back to, I mean years,

58
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,760
years and years and years,
15 years.

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,070
I absolutely love you guys. I love
you individually. And I'm saying this,

60
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:18,970
this isn't even a comedy riff,
but as a United force,

61
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,400
you're greater than uh, your, your
separate parts. Does that make sense?

62
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,560
You haven't seen all of my separate parts,
so you might revise that.

63
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,450
Oh my God, she's taking off her
clothes right now and I do revise that.

64
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,980
She's good. She's got a great, uh,
she's got a great set of talents.

65
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,260
Now. I, I made an incorrect assumption.

66
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:46,870
I didn't realize this was
a sincere conversation.

67
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,160
It isn't really what I like to do is
when you go insincere, I go sincere.

68
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,110
I startle you and,

69
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,440
and then you start to get to see her
and then I slam you with insincerity.

70
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,440
Freaking loves you.

71
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,710
He considers you a king among men.
And that's not a chat. It's nice.

72
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,060
I, I will lie in eyes. You at
any given opportunity, he does.

73
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:11,810
Well that's right.

74
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,360
Lion eyes or you want to hear that a
lot anymore when you first hear it,

75
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,420
it makes it the word sounds like it
means I will tear you apart like Elian as

76
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:22,860
opposed to I will hold you in high regard.
Right.

77
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:27,840
I will render you the king of any
given jungle. That's so nice of you.

78
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,460
Only is this big words when he's being
interviewed. But at home he's just like,

79
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,650
Ugh,
like cake.

80
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,170
There's no better way to say really.
There's no,

81
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,270
uh, I'm gonna say this. I don't want
to embarrass your both embarrass you,

82
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:51,420
but you're both a
supremely talented people,

83
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,550
but you're also real human beings.
You're nice, good ethical people.

84
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,130
I've that demonstrated in
private many, many, many times.

85
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,930
And I admire that about you both. I think
that. Thank you. That's very, very nice.

86
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:10,920
He was [inaudible] that's sincere.
I feel like the reason that, um,

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,120
we have had so many double dates with
you and you're beautiful and even killed

88
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:20,600
wife Liza as that,

89
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,400
whereas we have similarities in that
department as couples, as couples.

90
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,700
But I will say there are
differences which is um,

91
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,180
lies and I are both a little over
pressed you to our sexual animals.

92
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,340
Yeah,
I let it hang out.

93
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,740
I mean we have talked about this before
but you are quite open about the fact

94
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,400
that your beast like and I mean that as
a compliment or you mean your anal not

95
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:54,770
anal. No, I didn't mean ane.
Okay. Why did you go to angel?

96
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,340
Well beastiality in the Bible I
think is referring to and the,

97
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,900
but I didn't,

98
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,000
I said beast like beastiality
we'll get to that and listen.

99
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:08,450
Maybe that's something you guys
are into. I don't know. And I've,

100
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,690
and I've never in my life,
he just said

101
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,030
never in my life have I said
I want to read about butt sex.

102
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,210
Whereas my Bible just
never occurred to me.

103
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,980
Well Old Testament,
New Testament Leviticus specifically,

104
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,250
that's where all the good
stuff is. Okay. Thank you.

105
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,520
The Leviticus is the home of abominations.
Okay.

106
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,580
So,
but you too,

107
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:42,581
I mean you've told me personally stories
about the two of you being in nature in

108
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:49,931
the woods fornicating and
that it's this beautiful act.

109
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:54,200
And that animals are, are watching
you in Congress. Can I use that term?

110
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,340
Coyotes. Coyotes. Coyotes
watched you have sex.

111
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,940
Where was this?
It was in a park and cold water.

112
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,870
Cold Water Canyon here in Los
Angeles. So we were like, uh,

113
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,280
like on a beautiful camping trip. We are
literally in the middle of the city. Oh.

114
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:16,430
So anyone could have opened their back
door seeing you two going at it and

115
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:21,260
thrown cold water on you. Right.
You were in an almost an urban area,

116
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,760
but you found a sort of magical,
we found the wooded area,

117
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,270
a little corner,
a secluded area.

118
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,750
It was early on and it,
uh,

119
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:35,600
I feel like so many of the
pleasures in our marriage, uh,

120
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,570
have been cruise directed by Megan.
And this was no exception. Uh,

121
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,070
it was after our play, one night
we went to a fancy grocery store,

122
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:50,071
which was a new thing for me and got a
baguette and cheeses and a bottle of Nice

123
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:56,130
wine and, and she, she knew
the park. Uh, she may have

124
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,850
been there before me,
wasn't my first coyote.

125
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,743
Okay.

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,870
That or user like she's back
in the squirrels are like,

127
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,520
oh,
this guy does.

128
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,770
Uh, [inaudible]. And I'll
be honest, I'd have been,

129
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,850
I'm very ashamed of my own
body and I'm not comfortable.

130
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,270
I don't think I'd be naked
out in the world ever.

131
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,530
I won't take my clothes off
from my doctor. And then you to,

132
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,890
you must've seen in nick that he was
capable of shedding his clothes and

133
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:40,200
becoming almost this,
this naked Werewolf. Yeah.

134
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,030
Could commune with nature and
satisfy your most base urgent.

135
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,010
Yeah. That's one thing that I, I liked
about nick is that he's a really nice guy,

136
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:55,070
but he's also sort of like a demonic,
you know,

137
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,530
serial killer.

138
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,750
So there's both sides of that because
there's somebody too nice all the time.

139
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,750
You just want to punch him in
the face in the morning. Yeah.

140
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:08,620
And then the guys that are
really bad or bad. Yeah.

141
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,940
He strikes a balance.
Yeah.

142
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,030
I get a, um, Seder vibe
from you, nick. You know,

143
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,280
it was the old half man,
half goat with,

144
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,010
with a big genitals that that plays a
fight for and goes through the woods and

145
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,190
only wants to have sex
constantly and lives for today.

146
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,940
That's what I get partially from you

147
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,820
let you know when I first met nick,

148
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:33,821
I had only ever dated these
really like Sperry skinny,

149
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,360
boyish, kind of hairless and
draw basically gay guys. Yeah.

150
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,670
You know,
up until the end you are describing me.

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes.
Up until the aunt and I'm to go ahead.

152
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,530
And then I met nick and I didn't really
know what to make of it all and he at

153
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:55,430
the time, back then, that
was in 2000 he was like,

154
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,210
I take like 40 pounds
heavier. Sure. He was a big,

155
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,400
big man and he was bald for the play.
He shaved his head for the plan.

156
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:08,090
He had a mustache and it wasn't that cute.

157
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,180
I mean there's a lot of back hair.
I remember

158
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,850
when I first met you too,

159
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,960
it was a Saturday night live reunion show.

160
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:22,650
I had not met you and you came
up and you introduce me to nick.

161
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:29,010
And Nick was wearing a big leather biker
jacket and he had a big chain hanging

162
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:36,220
off and everyone else there was, you
know, prince was there and you know,

163
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,170
in sync. And it was just this
ridiculous gathering of, uh, of,

164
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:46,000
of people that were all dressed in their
finery, the grapes, all the grades. Um,

165
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,850
I think boys to men were present.

166
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,070
The Archie's were there and
then you show up and did, uh,

167
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,410
you kind of look like,
um,

168
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,580
it was interesting because my first
take was this is not what I expected.

169
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,920
This is not what I expected

170
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,910
you introduced me.
I mean there was,

171
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:07,940
there was a progression
of events and next, um,

172
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,970
sartorial styles stylings
because when I first met him,

173
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,560
he was wearing a pair of golden
overalls that he would write.

174
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,320
He used as a notepad basically.

175
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:23,390
So if he needed to write some
his phone number down here,

176
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:27,890
just ride it cause he couldn't afford,
you know, paper. And he was living in, uh,

177
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:33,130
an unfinished basement of somebody is
unfinished basement that didn't have,

178
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,500
are an actual floor or walls.

179
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,590
So he could urinate indiscriminately
in any given corner of his lodgings.

180
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:47,960
You would do that? Well, I mean
wouldn't you? I'd use a jar.

181
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,420
I've been in that situation and I
couldn't afford a jar. I mean I would,

182
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,710
I would get,
I would get a few feet away from my bed.

183
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,900
Oh I wasn't so you're civilized. Yeah,
it wasn't an animal. Yeah. So it started,

184
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:00,650
that's where we,

185
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,820
that was the jumping off point and then
by the time we went to like a fancy

186
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:05,600
thing,

187
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,600
he was really like his idea of high
style was turquoise jewelry and a crazy

188
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,790
leather jacket. He's still,
you can tell. I still really,

189
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,690
that's his dream. Yeah. So yeah.

190
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,170
I I had actually met you. I just want
to revise. I'm just for the record,

191
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:28,700
cause I know this is going to go down
in history. I had, I had done your shot.

192
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,650
You had already met me.
I met as a couple the first time I

193
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,010
met you guys together because now
I think of you as one person. Yes.

194
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:40,090
We are wanting to become Sonny and
Cher. Yeah. Woodward and Bernstein.

195
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,860
Um, you know, you're, you don't
mention one without the other.

196
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:48,790
You're a peanut butter and jelly. You're
Leopold and Loeb. Look it up. Kids,

197
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,740
they were terrible, terrible killers.
Uh, without remorse in the 1920s,

198
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,340
they were executed. I mean,
right now they were not executed.

199
00:13:57,341 --> 00:14:00,550
They were put in a prison for life.
One was killed in prison,

200
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:05,170
the other was released. Uh, and I
think you have the late sixties,

201
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:08,530
early seventies, moved to Puerto
Rico and died there two years later.

202
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,490
Why do I know that? I don't know a
lot like them. And Ken was a little,

203
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,210
we went down one of my warm halls,
Leopold and Loeb kids look it up.

204
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:19,300
One of the great murder stories of all
time. But there isn't time for that.

205
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,220
There's only time for you. Um, Megan,
we've talked a lot about your family, uh,

206
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,360
in private and you've asked me
never to discuss it publicly.

207
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,010
And this is a podcast,
so when I don't think that counts,

208
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,730
you describe your family and first of all,
let me compliment you on the book,

209
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:34,181
the book,

210
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:39,100
the greatest love story ever told on the
New York Times bestseller list and also

211
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,780
the Los Angeles Times best seller list.
Yeah, Nigga Malawi. Nick Offerman,

212
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:47,290
the greatest love story ever told to buy
it if for no other reason than just the

213
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,000
book jacket is the best book
jacket I have seen. I don't,

214
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,370
I think in memory

215
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,690
book jacket as well as all
the photos in the book, uh,

216
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,390
were the brainchild of Megan.
She art directed all of it.

217
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,640
It's really beautifully done and these
are great photos, fantastic photos

218
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,700
and they let me design the whole back,

219
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:12,701
which for me was a huge thing because I
don't usually get that kind of autonomy

220
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:16,310
on any project.
I'm just the hired help,

221
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,960
you have so many talents.

222
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,710
People can sort of almost take it for
granted that you're this great comedic

223
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,950
actress,
but you're also an amazing singer.

224
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,540
I've seen you perform many times and you
would be famous in your own right as a

225
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:33,290
singer.
Then I go to your home and you,

226
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:38,291
your first question you want to ask is
what fancy person did you get to get you

227
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:41,720
this art in this sculpture?
And you did it.

228
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,840
You love collecting and finding art and
you're incredibly talented at it and you

229
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:50,570
could also make it as a
top designer home design.

230
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,680
That's probably what I would do if I
wasn't doing all the actings and things

231
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,990
you think you would
really be a home designer

232
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,730
am almost at a certain point when I
wasn't getting a lot of work as an actor.

233
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,120
I am most general tried to enroll
at Ucla to study interior design.

234
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,690
I mean that it sort of
takes your breath away.

235
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,380
The Times I've been allowed in your home
and the Times I've also gone in when

236
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:19,310
you're not there, uh, it, uh,
it takes your breath away.

237
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,240
The other thing that takes your breath
away is I would admire the furniture and

238
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,470
it's absurd,

239
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,640
but much of it has been designed
and built by Mr Nick Offerman.

240
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,070
It's insane. I'll walk up to the nicest
piece of furniture in the house. Oh,

241
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,340
nick made that.
I haven't made anything since.

242
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:41,810
I think I had popsicle sticks and I tray
I traced my hand to make a Turkey and

243
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:46,811
then I put pop popsicle sticks over it
and recently sold at Southerby's for

244
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:48,830
$2.30.

245
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,050
Well, uh, it's um, it may be
immodest of me to say this,

246
00:16:55,051 --> 00:17:00,030
but I think Megan's greatest
talent is her taste. She almost,

247
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:04,890
anything she puts her hand
to is astonishing. She wants
to cut our poodle's hair.

248
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,480
Yeah.
I cut our pills hair for years

249
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,890
and it was cuter than anything uh,
Pixar has ever envisioned.

250
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,210
Sometimes.
You know,

251
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:20,211
the thing though is I'm doggedly
determined to not educate myself in any of

252
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:26,070
these areas. Like I never studied acting.
I never, I don't know anything about art.

253
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:28,430
I just pick stuff that
I like. And then, yeah,

254
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,220
you know, this is infuriating
to so many people listening.

255
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,030
So I think it's really appealing
about both of you when I'm around you,

256
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:38,810
is that you're doing stuff that you love.
It comes out of a need.

257
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,070
Like you need to make things out of wood.
You need to decorate,

258
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:45,050
you need to make people laugh.
You need to sing.

259
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,230
Well you do too. I mean you, you know,
we need to express ourselves creatively.

260
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,020
I don't,

261
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,020
I just need desperately want the cash
and this was the best way to get it fast.

262
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,310
I need a lot of cash because
I made some bad mistakes.

263
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,680
But you said Megan,
I think you,

264
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,320
you described your family as very small,
mostly dead and crazy.

265
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,520
I mean,

266
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,470
my family is scattered throughout
institutions across the US.

267
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,670
And your dad was up like a practical joker
but not necessarily a funny practical

268
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:19,230
joker? No, he was,

269
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,910
I had a very dark sense of humor and for
like a couple of examples of his humor

270
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:28,911
would be he and my mom and I would be
sitting at the dinner table and then my

271
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,750
father would all of a sudden pretend
that he was having a massive heart attack

272
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,600
and then fall over. He'd
really, you know, he did commit,

273
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:40,470
I'll give him that fall over
endo has played of, you know,

274
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,910
spaghetti or whatever.
And the first time he did it,

275
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:48,540
my mom and I were like,
is he dead or what's going on?

276
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,330
And then after that we were
just kinda like, you know,

277
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,360
get out of the Spaghetti and
then another time I guess.

278
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,090
So your reaction when you thought
it was real was to just wonder, Huh?

279
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Wonder if that's real or not? Yeah, well,

280
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:04,860
I mean I knew it was terrifying
because I was, you know,

281
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,830
eight so it was really scary.
I'm,

282
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,340
I'm downplaying it for the sake of,
you know, podcast listeners everywhere.

283
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:13,590
I don't want to try,

284
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,100
I want to be taken into
child services. Um, but uh,

285
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,600
then another thing that he did was like,
I used to take the bus.

286
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:26,580
The only year I took
the bus was third grade.

287
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:30,210
So say I was nine and I came in the door.

288
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:33,240
I didn't like being alone with my
father because he was really terrifying.

289
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,300
And so I came in the door and my mom's
car wasn't there and my father was

290
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:42,090
standing at the top of the
stairs and I said, where's mommy?

291
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:46,350
And he said he had this focal affectation
that he did all the time. He said,

292
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,670
I'm sorry to tell you this,
my and I met your mother is dead.

293
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,500
And I for a second I was like,
wait.

294
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,470
And then he said,
and then you just kind of went on.

295
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:03,120
He elaborated on how she had died
and it was like a lot of, some,

296
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:06,780
some children lose their parents at an
early age and it wasn't going to be an

297
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:11,040
easy life. And, um, and
finally I said, you know,

298
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,620
where is she?
And he said the grocery store.

299
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,040
Oh my God. Yeah. He also told me one time,

300
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,600
no, it wasn't cute. And he also

301
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,340
tell me one time when I
was in high school that um,

302
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,360
he'd had to go to the doctor because he
had a little skin cancer lesion or his

303
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,370
ear. So he had to have
it. Like Marie moved.

304
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,910
And I talked to him on the phone because
my parents had been separated by them

305
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:42,230
and I said, how did it go?
And he said, well, I'm sorry
to tell you this, my darling.

306
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:46,820
But they had to take the
air and I said, Oh, what?

307
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,500
And he goes,
yes,

308
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,260
I don't want to frighten your little
friends when I come by the house. And I,

309
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,420
I said,
I'm sorry to hear that.

310
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,600
And he then did not correct himself until
I saw him two weeks later and he had

311
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:06,640
two ears and I was like, and he'd
already forgotten about it by then.

312
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:11,740
Yeah. Thing is, he's clearly not
amusing you. So who is this for?

313
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,330
Is it just for himself?

314
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,750
Teeny weeny sociopathic.

315
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,710
A little in the cute, cute sociopath's.

316
00:21:22,711 --> 00:21:26,100
Yeah. Unlike Leopold and Loeb, no kids.

317
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,510
I just stay true sociopath.
I need to take a quick break,

318
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,610
but we have so much more to talk about

319
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,410
now it's time for this segment.

320
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:44,340
Conan O'brien pays off the mortgage
on his beach house during that.

321
00:21:44,341 --> 00:21:47,610
Why you start to laugh? It's
not funny. It's a big mortgage.

322
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,610
You made so many bad
decisions is a bad decision.

323
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:52,860
I think in the long run it will
end up being a good decision.

324
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,780
But in the short period of time right now,
I need to make some money. Okay. Okay.

325
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,600
Then we're going to do that right now.
Pay Down that mortgage.

326
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:11,060
Well, I kind of wanted to talk about
this new APP. It's one that, uh,

327
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,970
actually sounds pretty cool.
Uh,

328
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,140
I don't know if anyone out there is
always wanting to learn how to play a

329
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:19,160
musical instrument. I mean, who
hasn't everybody's have do we,

330
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,260

played a musical instrument. Yeah.

331
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,940
But I don't know how to
learn. I wish there was an
app that could teach me, well,

332
00:22:26,941 --> 00:22:27,840
maybe I can help you.

333
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,380
There's something called using
one app that's using [inaudible].

334
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,700
It's a personal music tutor for
the digital age. Cool. Yeah.

335
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,120
So you don't even have to
hire a, a music tutor. Me.

336
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:40,470
And if I was a music tutor right now,

337
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:44,280
I'd be sweating bullets because uses
[inaudible] is going to put you out of

10 million people have occasionally
made a mistake but not with you.

365
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,230
Hey, you know what I was thinking about
the other day? What? How much I love, uh,

366
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:41,090
I love, uh, meet all kinds of
protein, whether it's chicken or beef,

367
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,400
yogurt. I eat a lot of meat, don't you?

368
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,030
You were just thinking about
how much you love meat. Yeah.

369
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,430
What all kinds of stuff could you
see my thought balloon over my head?

370
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,450
It was a pork chop and it
was a steak. Anyway, I love,

371
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,420
I love really good meat,
but it has to be good meat.

372
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,910
I have to know where it's been. I have
to know that it was, you know, good beef,

373
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:04,790
a hundred percent grass fed
chicken, pork. I need to know that.

374
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,910
And that's why I trust
the people at butcher box.

375
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,300
All the animals are treated very
humanely during their lifetime.

376
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,640
I believe I might be making this up.

377
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,840
All the animals die in their sleep of
old age. I don't know if that's true.

378
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,110
I think they do. I think they
just quietly slip away and uh,

379
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:23,780
they've had a happy life and then
you can taste that. And the flavor.

380
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,210
I like when I'm eating
a chicken or a beef,

381
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:29,480
I like to know that it just passed away
and it's bed surrounded by its relatives.

382
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:33,170
Okay. Each box that you get, this
is great. They send it to you.

383
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,230
Each box comes with at least
nine to 11 pounds of meat.

384
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:39,500
That's enough for 24 individuals
sized meals. No, it's not.

385
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:43,250
Not In my family growing up. That's
insane. Can you imagine my family,

386
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,910
if there was nine to 11 pounds
of meat, that's one meal. Yeah,

387
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:51,650
there were too many of you are, too many
of us anyway. My parents did that. Not me.

388
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:57,200
Uh, I've got so personal, so fast anyway.

389
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,460
Uh,
it's really great.

390
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,140
$129 a month works out to less
than $6 a meal. It's really fast.

391
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:07,370
It's convenient. So if you're interested
in, you should be. This is good stuff.

401
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,040
well I'm told that someone on staff
had it to Nisha. Tenicia got it. She

402
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,790
said the food is delicious. Yeah,
she says great and she's picky.

403
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,040
She's picky eater.
She is.

404
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,890
She is healthy and is picky
about her food and she loves it.

405
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,840
And she also said the bacon was a male.
Yes,

406
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,020
but your box from Tanya don't be
a for butcher box. Butcher box

407
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,560
and we're back. We didn't, we
didn't really take a break.

408
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,440
You just heard a lot of stuff.
I changed my clothes,

409
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,890
which was delicious.
I had radical face surgery.

410
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,870
Nick,
when I first got to know you,

411
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:23,530
I really did think this guy
comes from another time.

412
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,880
You are not a a man of this millennia.

413
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,940
I really believe that you were,

414
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,860
I think you I think know the past. I
think from the past. I really believe,

415
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:38,560
and I hate to know I'm supposed
to say yes and in Improv, but no,

416
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:43,561
and I really believe that you are a
very honest policemen and 1840 and um,

417
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,490
and woodworker who makes puppets.

418
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,210
And you came here into these
times to talk some sense into us.

419
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,580
That's the sense I get.
You're very old world.

420
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,660
What do you think or come by it honest? I
mean I, uh, when I got to show business,

421
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:00,710
it was interesting.

422
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:05,711
I did recognize immediately how
superficial it was an I was immediately

423
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:10,700
disinterested and I said,
okay,

424
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:13,700
I'm not going to chase
this particular brass ring.

425
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,270
I'm going to continue working
as a carpenter. And they
have my number. If they,

426
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,490
if they need a slow talking
guy to drive a bus or you know,

427
00:28:22,491 --> 00:28:27,440
play a plumber, they'll find
me. And eventually, but by
dribs and drabs, you know,

428
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:30,800
the business and I came together.
But I'm in hindsight,

429
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:34,850
I'm grateful that I had that
wherewithal. I Dunno, it comes from,

430
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:38,930
I think my parents from just
having the sensibility to,

431
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,590
to look at it at any given
context and say, okay,

432
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:47,591
all my peers that are putting themselves
through this auditioning process,

433
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,690
they're all stressed out.
They're all depressed,

434
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:56,050
they're all drinking way too
much, and uh, I can do that. Sure.

435
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:01,190
And still get paid to hammer
nails. Um, and so I, I can't, uh,

436
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,090
I can't claim any great knowledge,
you know, of my own accord.

437
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:06,080
I think I'm just lucky

438
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:11,250
and you know, I've changed, I think
I've changed a lot since we first met.

439
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,290
And you've changed a
lot since we first met.

440
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,060
I wash myself as often as once a week now.

441
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,940
Yeah.
That's what the three stooges used to say.

442
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:24,740
They would crash through the floor and
all three of them would land in a bathtub

443
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,400
and one of them go like, but it's not
Sunday. And I always thought that was,

444
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:31,670
I didn't get that joke when I was a kid
and then later on I grew up and realized,

445
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,580
cause we only had to take
a bath like once a week.

446
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,270
But then I later on realized
that that's considered uncouth,

447
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,000
that you're supposed to have a
bath once or twice, you know,

448
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,650
every couple of days it really,
anytime you begin to stink,

449
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,800
oh okay. Well I should, I could do better
then. Yeah. Your step up your, again,

450
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,190
I'm going to tell a quick story
and I know I've told this,

451
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,710
recounted this to many people,

452
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:58,560
but when Megan was in Seattle
and you were doing, um,

453
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,900
the young Frankenstein and lies and
I were there visiting her family,

454
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,750
so we hung out a little bit and
we went to see you in the show,

455
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:09,730
which we absolutely loved.
You killed it.

456
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,930
And one day I mentioned I like
to ride bikes and Nick said,

457
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:17,200
let's ride bikes together. So the two of
us, one of those long bike turned into,

458
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:19,690
took his way south of Lake Washington and,

459
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:24,400
and then all of a sudden I heard like
a popping explosion sound and Nick's

460
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:28,240
change just exploded it, which can
happen sometimes on a bike. And I'll,

461
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,800
I'll say that as an experienced bikes man.
So you know,

462
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:36,790
I'm really ride bikes. It exploded in
pieces when everywhere, and now I know me,

463
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:41,050
I would have gotten off the bike
and said, oh shit, my bike blew up.

464
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,690
This was pre Uber or anything like that.

465
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:47,590
But I guess I just have to pick it up or
hide it in a Bush and then go walk and

466
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:51,670
find a cab. Nick gathers all the
pieces and I said, what are you doing?

467
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,790
And he said, well I think this
can be fixed. And then he said,

468
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:57,610
I just need a flat rock.
And I didn't know,

469
00:30:57,611 --> 00:31:00,580
I thought he was doing a bit
and he didn't know you as well.

470
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,540
And then you went and you found a flat
rock and this is me telling exactly what

471
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:05,110
happened.

472
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,890
You assembled all the pieces and you
lay them out on a flat rock and then you

473
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:12,130
found another rock and you were inspected
them all and then you found the right

474
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:17,131
one and you started hammering the pieces
back together again until after about

475
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:22,711
40 minutes you had completely reassembled
the chain using prehistoric tools you

476
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:28,660
got on and then you went on your way
and when I brought it up later on,

477
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,700
you acted as if anyone else I would be
bragging about that for years you acted

478
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:36,580
like it was unmanly of
me to even mention it.

479
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,810
This is what one does when their bicycle,
when a machine breaks,

480
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:43,390
you find rocks and you fix it
and then you're on your way.

481
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,400
What's your problem city boy, that's
just, that's just proper comportment.

482
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,380
I think you could have made a,

483
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,470
if you needed to in that moment or radio
using using twigs and a dead rabbit and

484
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:58,804
some manure.

485
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,460
I think you could have made a pretty
good am FM radio that also got serious.

486
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,923
If you

487
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,020
that's it's so true. And we
seriously, for many years,

488
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:13,490
because we watched the show survivor
religiously and then to the season finales

489
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:14,510
for the last two years,

490
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:20,110
we have always said that we thought that
nick would kill on survivor for them.

491
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,640
So those very reasons.

492
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,960
Have you ever thought about that you'd
go on a celebrity survivor and you could

493
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:26,620
clean it up?

494
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,270
Celebrity just regular

495
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,910
it's been discussed. Yeah. I mean we,

496
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,500
we've sincerely looked
at it in reality it was

497
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,250
actually maybe going to happen and
then he got another, like an acting

498
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,280
job. Yeah. The thing of the things
that you would really do it,

499
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:45,410
you wouldn't really go on
survivor. I would love to. I mean,

500
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:49,250
I think it'd be really fun. I don't know.
I think it'd be good at some things,

501
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:51,480
but I'm not certain that I would be,
you know,

502
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,000
thank you.
Wouldn't be good at,

503
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,440
because I can't think of one
thing you wouldn't be good at.

504
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,490
Uh,
I,

505
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:01,580
I'm not sure how well I would fare in
the social aspect of the game because

506
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,510
everybody freaking all loves you.
Right. But you don't play games right.

507
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,530
He doesn't, he has no, he has no guidance.

508
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,220
Big Edit. The lying. Yeah, his brain.

509
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,750
He's not aft up enough to
think of how to square it.

510
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,050
And also you would probably say something
like you are kind of, okay, go on. Sorry.

511
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,003
No, no, go ahead.

512
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,550
One time we were staying in a hotel,

513
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,580
I was in Seattle and we were there for
seven or eight weeks and we had been in

514
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:34,490
this same room for the whole time and we
are moved and like we were living there

515
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:37,280
right? And they were like, oh,

516
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:41,120
but there's this one weekend where we
have to move you out of the room because

517
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:46,010
we, it's a honeymoon situation and we
promise these people like, you know,

518
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:50,510
two years ago that they could have
this year suite for the weekend.

519
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,770
And we were like, wait, we have
to move all over everything.

520
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,630
So Nick,

521
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,980
I'm really surprised me
with his revenge fantasies.

522
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,160
And the one I remember most distinctly
was moving all our stuff out and be like,

523
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:11,570
okay fine. No problem. We'll just move
into another room for the weekend.

524
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:16,220
We'll move all, pack up, all of
our belongings. It's fine. Um,

525
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,270
as we're doing that,

526
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:21,710
nick would some how procure
a dead to dead rats,

527
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,790
which she would put,

528
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,210
he would unscrew the heating the
event over the heating system.

529
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,583
Yeah.

530
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,280
And he would put the dead rats in there
and then screw the thing back on and

531
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,840
then turn the heat on

532
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,940
and slowly dead rats that would fill that
room described it to me in such to do,

533
00:34:41,341 --> 00:34:45,810
like he'd thought it out down
to the last detail. I do that,

534
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,100
I think about it, but I don't do
it right. So now this my assistant,

535
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:51,540
so I just jump in for a
second. Yeah. I have a great,

536
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,470
I have a lot of pent up Irish rage
and I have a good imagination.

537
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,750
I think of great things I could, I could
do, but I never do them. Right. Right.

538
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,650
But a lot of them have
to do with murder too,

539
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,270
about how you would murder and it,

540
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,810
so it gets a little bit more
dark than putting rats in event,

541
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,960
which is also really screwed up. Sorry.
It's a good idea what you have. Sure.

542
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,130
I, uh, if the other day, you
know, I'm trying to watch my,

543
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,750
I've been trying to eat well and
uh, I've been told, you know,

544
00:35:24,751 --> 00:35:27,100
you can occasionally have a
steak but has to be really lean.

545
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:31,560
Just make sure it has no sauce on.
I meant this, she, she restaurant,

546
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,760
it's actually more of a hipstery
restaurant and they have a stake that they

547
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,800
serve and it's the steak.

548
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:40,260
It's a really lean cut and it
just comes with vegetables.

549
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:44,190
And it was the perfect thing for me to
eat. And I was hungry and it says, yeah,

550
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:48,510
and we smother it in this
butter sauce. And I said, great,

551
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,700
I'll have that, but
just could you just, uh,

552
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,590
could I not have the butter sauce and
this guy in like a tweed cap wearing

553
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:58,020
suspenders with a,
with like a,

554
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:01,830
a hipstery mustache said,
no,

555
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,150
you have to take it the way we, and I
said, no, all I'm asking for is, you know,

556
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:10,380
the stuff that I'm not allowed to eat,
can you just not have that?

557
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:15,060
And the guy went, hey man, that's not
our scene here. You got to have it on.

558
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:16,470
And so he, I said, okay,

559
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:20,910
I'll just have the the fish then
and I said it like that and he went,

560
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,300
got it and walked away and I spent the
next 40 minutes doing elaborate with lies

561
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:29,400
at the table,

562
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,460
ways that I was going to fuck with this
guy and screw over this restaurant and

563
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:40,380
take them down and make them pay and then
ever of course every time he came over

564
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:44,280
I'm just like, oh hey. Yeah, I'm
perfectly nice left. A really nice tip.

565
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,650
Ate the fish I didn't want but I was,
you know, but God, I had great fantasies.

566
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:54,300
I think I was going to put his body in a
heat vent. It's, I think that's healthy.

567
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:58,860
I do a lot of revenge. Found a
sizing, most of them. Just to wrap,

568
00:36:58,861 --> 00:36:59,760
just to wrap that up,

569
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:03,720
I do think then you could do well on
survivor because I think that you do have

570
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,720
that side of you,
which is what I started by saying,

571
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:10,560
which is that you're not just
like Super Mr. Nice all the time.

572
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,930
You have another side
can ask him the question.

573
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,460
Have you guys ever watching naked
and afraid? Could you do nick,

574
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,960
could you go on? Could either of you
go on naked and afraid? Wait a minute.

575
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:26,961
You're in the woods with coyotes and
butterflies watching you doing it?

576
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:31,150
Like animals, like bugs
crawling up your badge. No,

577
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,490
no.
The vantage bugs are definitely,

578
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,250
we're going to look in the car. I
didn't know. You know what I have to,

579
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,090
I have a book of insects at home.
I will look up the Vage bug.

580
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,790
I'm not familiar with it.
Are not down with,

581
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,100
there's some things
that I love watching it.

582
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,310
I think those people
deserve like commit it.

583
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:53,640
They're like hardcore
survival survival us. Yeah,

584
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:55,680
but it's a really weird I,

585
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,940
the thing that I can't do is
I grew up in the east coast.

586
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,360
I spent a lot of time traipsing around
the woods and stuff and I was sent off to

587
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:07,710
camp bugs. It's the thing I love
about Los Angeles. There's no box.

588
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:12,210
There's no bugs. Seemed to be no bags
anywhere, right? Yes. For frankly,

589
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,250
I can't wait if that's
the price we pay for it,

590
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:18,930
if it means global warming
and the extinction of our
species all, I'm all for it,

591
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:21,990
but, but I don't like the
bugs in our naked and afraid.

592
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:26,850
The idea of being naked and
being constantly attacked
by bugs, all manner of,

593
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,660
of uncertainty I would
like about it is you know,

594
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:35,661
learning all the crazy tricks that they
have to like build shelters and you

595
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:41,500
know, they magically can kind
of solve any problem with their,

596
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,160
the wherewithal that they've garnered
over the years is survivalists.

597
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:47,590
I find that fascinating,
but they're naked.

598
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:52,120
It's so fun and afraid and afraid
and I'm always afraid when I'm naked.

599
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,000
It's very, it is actually,
you're afraid to be me naked.

600
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,930
I want to be on the show.
Afraid to be naked.

601
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,880
She just huddled in a corner and
refuse to take up your clothes.

602
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,890
You're not even in the wild.
You're in your comfortable home.

603
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,620
You're in your bedroom and my
bedroom and I'm fully clothed,

604
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,940
but the producers off cameras
sync, please. You've got
to take off your clothes,

605
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:22,090
and I'm desperately trying,
but at the end I always,

606
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:23,650
when hundreds of thousands
of dollars a month,

607
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,860
you naked with a naked
woman who wasn't me.

608
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:34,180
You had not.
Nick is the most,

609
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:39,540
he's the least likely man that I ever
have known to not ever even look at

610
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:43,670
another woman. It's kind
of, it's so strange,

611
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,290
man. Who wouldn't not.
So I don't know how that,

612
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,750
I have no idea what nick around a
naked woman who's not you. What?

613
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:01,580
Nick would be incredibly embarrassed
and wouldn't know what to do or where to

614
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:04,510
put his eyeballs are a three piece suit

615
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,570
out of Cherry Wood.
Beautiful Mahogany.

616
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,680
He's not a cheater or he's not.

617
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,130
He doesn't ever even look at.
It's weird.

618
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,730
Look at other women doesn't do that.
That's nice.

619
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:27,090
I think I would overcompensate
in some way I would try to,

620
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,313
do you know what I mean?

621
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,190
I do a lot of shtick about them
being naked and me being naked,

622
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,700
but all the while just humiliating myself.

623
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,400
I think it's best that I
not go on naked and afraid.

624
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,040
Do not go on naked and afraid. I think so.
I think none of us are going on it now.

625
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,300
It's out. I've been
invited. Here's the thing,

626
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:52,750
here's really what it comes down to.
Megan and I have a two week rule.

627
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,490
Whenever apart for more than two weeks,

628
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:59,950
I'm suspending it for this
cause I really want to watch it.

629
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,740
When you go on survivor, whether you're
the first person kicked off or the,

630
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:07,780
the the winner,

631
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,980
everyone has to stay for
six weeks because you can't,

632
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,640
the world's can't know who
goes home, goes home. So if

633
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:22,120
they wouldn't let me visit him,
he got kicked off after four weeks.

634
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,560
But you know what, you could,
I mean, first of all lies.

635
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:29,890
And I would come and stay at your place.
I love your house. We'd stay there.

636
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,170
You don't seem thrilled, but
I'm, I am thrilled. This is,

637
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,920
no, that's not what I'm getting at
all. And I read faces. But anyway,

638
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:45,420
I would make it my business to be
around and protecting you and uh,

639
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,480
being a good friend to you and you, uh,
you wouldn't even miss this guy. Oh,

640
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,690
you'd be so many laughs.

641
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:55,691
So many good times for survivor is such
that this would be the one and only

642
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,030
exception I would make
to our two week rule.

643
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,750
And I read it and I'd have my
wife and I have a two week rule,

644
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,550
but ours is every two weeks.
She wants me to go away for eight weeks

645
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,310
capitalist. It's a little
different than what you guys do,

646
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:17,180
but it's kept us together. That's good.
I'm, I'm glad that you would suspend that.

647
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,320
I would have allowed that.
You would do that if we did that

648
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,450
and I agreed to it. Uh, there's
uh, there's eventually on the show,

649
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,540
um,
late in the game weeks in,

650
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:33,750
they bring in loved ones of
the contestants and quite
often when the loved one

651
00:42:34,991 --> 00:42:37,990
is revealed and they,
they run in class with each other,

652
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:42,460
it could be a spouse or a
parent or a sibling. They,

653
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:46,420
there's a lot of sobbing and an
incredible emotional upheaval.

654
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:51,810
I would fall on the ground and
cry my eyes out because I don't,

655
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,940
I dunno if I could be away
from you for six weeks.

656
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,660
That's a really sweet moment.
Start making love to coconuts,

657
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,890
which you could probably fashion so
that it's probably more pleasurable.

658
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,330
Well listen, I've done a little
reading on this and if you're gonna,

659
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,340
if you're gonna make love to
a Mellon Mellon's in his past,

660
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:19,340
let's just leave it at that.
Obviously you need to bore a hole,

661
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:23,070
but the thing you might not realize
is you want to champ for it though.

662
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,990
That's my question.
I'm guessing hopefully your pocket knife.

663
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,660
So what would you do to the whole,
you gotta know you got a Chamfer,

664
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,940
the edge of that whole cause there Ryan
is sharp and it will really chafe. Yes.

665
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,360
This is just something I've read up on
and if it's a cantaloupe and you can warm

666
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:44,780
it up for a couple of minutes,
how you do that microwave won't be sorry.

667
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,460
A couple of minutes in the microwave.

668
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,840
And then you've got chamfered
edges and then do you,

669
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,820
how long can you keep them knowing around?

670
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,710
Come on last. Well can you
draw this for me? Yeah, I can.

671
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:04,620
I mean there, it's kind of
a one. I'm about to hit the
road. I'm just about to go.

672
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,950
Do a tour and I'm going
to be alone. Yeah. Yeah.

673
00:44:08,951 --> 00:44:13,920
It's kind of despoiled
well travel with

674
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:20,800
um,
this took a turn and you know what?

675
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:25,801
Mostly usually I would say I didn't expect
that but when you to for the melon is

676
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,120
very touching.
We are both,

677
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,010
we are gentlemen and we are chivalrous and

678
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,190
uh, you know, treat that melon. Wow.

679
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,700
The point is I would
say to any other guests,

680
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,100
I didn't see it going this
way when you walked in.

681
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,430
Only I did see it going in this way when
both of you walked in because you are a

682
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,380
sex depraved animalistic.
Sensualists yeah,

683
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:57,780
I think nothing, uh, you know
ravish each other nightly and uh,

684
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,520
it sickens me. I think it's wrong. I
think it's evil. No, that's your problem.

685
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,133
Okay.

686
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,920
Get it on. But yeah, you know what,
you two are welcome to do it here.

687
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,950
No one can see you.
There'll be some sounds in the background,

688
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:17,240
but I can hum to cover those sounds.
Can you see him from where you are?

689
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:22,010
Cause yeah, you look really
handsome. Yeah, you did really good.

690
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:27,050
Hang on. Did you have some work
done? Uh, he, uh, I got work done.

691
00:45:27,051 --> 00:45:31,490
I wish I'd paid more for it. I like
cheap. Oh, well then it looks, I mean,

692
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,340
you get what you pay for.
That's the problem.

693
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,190
It's a place that said you're
in and out in an hour and yeah,

694
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,060
they don't use anesthesia and
they say they do take, uh,

695
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,350
they take bonded checks. And
uh, so I went there and I said,

696
00:45:48,351 --> 00:45:51,770
just let's pull back the cheeks.
And it got infected.

697
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,880
An old melons.
Exactly.

698
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,340
They sack over your shoulder to shoulder.
I've used melon. Is that what you said?

699
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:03,174
Yeah,

700
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,360
if they'd been despoiled by a celebrity
that you can actually sell them on Ebay.

701
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:12,900
Do you want it? We want some
melon. A melon that nick Offerman.

702
00:46:12,901 --> 00:46:17,220
Fuck.
And then you watch the bidding go crazy.

703
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,430
Uh, I apologize to
everyone. All right Nigga.

704
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,350
Mohali Nick Offerman, there's
no greater couple, uh,

705
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:31,170
in the history of the world. We
wish you all the best. Bye. Bye.

706
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,383
Thank you.

707
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:42,440
And now it's time for a segment called
Conan O'Brien pays off the mortgage on

708
00:46:42,441 --> 00:46:43,460
his beach house.

709
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:53,630
I built my life around my hair. You did.
You know what I mean? It's a trademark.

710
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,230
It's a trademark. I started, you know,
my hair is a big part of my confidence,

711
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,930
my personality.
If I lost my hair tomorrow,

712
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:04,880
I'd I quickly buy like an old Lucille
ball wig and put it on from the Lucille

713
00:47:04,881 --> 00:47:09,530
ball state. Okay. No one would notice.
No, probably not. It would look the same.

714
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:14,000
But so Harris say it's
important to people's confidence
to their sense of self.

715
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,780
And um, that's why I uh, I was
going to mention hair club.

716
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,570
Hair club's the leader in
total hair solutions. You know,

717
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,210
they have a legacy of
success for over 40 years.

718
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,170
Who's been in the hair business
for 40 years? Yeah, I know buddy.

719
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,620
I remember those commercials from
when I was young. Hair club. Yeah.

720
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:33,500
I'm not just a member. I'm the
president. Right. Sy Sperling. Just him.

721
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,070
Is that who it was? I think it
was, I don't think we're probably,

722
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,800
he's not here on the ad copy, so maybe
we're not supposed to mention him anymore.

723
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:42,310
Oh, I'm sorry. And who even
knows if this is the same either.

724
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:45,220
They'd been bought out in CISE Berlin is,
maybe there's legal stuff.

725
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,160
Who even knows we've wandered into a
total weird area here. I'm sorry. I, yeah,

726
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,900
I didn't expect you to
know that guy. Ah, yeah,

727
00:47:52,901 --> 00:47:55,600
I remember those commercials really well.
I wrote to his fan club.

728
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,090
I ended up hanging out with them.
Uh,

729
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:03,400
I was a groupie in the sites of early
gang for a while. It's cool. Anyway,

730
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:03,671
you know,

731
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:07,360
people that are looking to regrow hair
or revitalize their hair if they got any

732
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:11,080
kind of hair problem. It sounds to me
like hair clubs, the place for you,

733
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:15,490
don't you think? No, I don't have personal
experience with losing all my hair.

734
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,960
But it could happen at any time. Yeah.
You're a guy. Guys lose their hair.

735
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:20,441
You know what?

736
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:25,441
Not if they have a low testosterone that's
a guys with high testosterone tend to

737
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:30,520
lose all their hair. I was very
wisely opted for low testosterone.

738
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,930
You opted for low testosterone. Yes. Done.

739
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,720
Everything I could to keep my testosterone
is low as possible in my life so that

740
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:41,200
I can hang onto my hair.
Um, you did it. I did it.

741
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:46,000
I kept my hair and my voice
still hasn't dropped. But anyway,

742
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,700
why dwell on the negative when
I should? Well, on the positive,

743
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,390
if I were to lose my hair, I'd go
to hair club. I really would, um,

744
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,310
or just leave the country.
But anyway,

745
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,390
they seem to know what
they're talking about.

746
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,980
They've been in the business
longer than anybody.

747
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,120
And we know women lose their hair too.
That's true. It's not just for men.

748
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,170
That's right. It isn't just for
men. If women lose their hair also,

749
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,140
you don't think of women losing
their hair, but uh, but they do,

750
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,760
they do lose their hair as well.

751
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,790
It happens more to men
because of the testosterone.

752
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,630
But that's why it's less frequent
for women or people like me with low

753
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:21,250
testosterone to lose their hair.
Your group did with women? No.

754
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,390
Let's just let that go.
So if you're struggling with hair loss,

755
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,630
if that's a problem for you, go to a
hair club. Maybe they're the solution,

756
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,710
you know,
give him a shot.

767
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:11,230
club.com/conan hair club.com/conan.
I'll be saying it in my sleep.

768
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:16,840
This is Matt.

769
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,930
I believe in the beginning you said you
might be ambivalent and you were a bit

770
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:22,030
more positive after this conversation.

771
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,060
What are the prospects of continuing
this friendship? Do you think

772
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:28,203
we were

773
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,160
justing when we said ambivalent and
by we, I mean nick. That's right.

774
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:36,950
And we love Conan.
I mean Matt Madly.

775
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,750
And so I think everything has had
a very, very, very happy beginning,

776
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:43,190
middle, and end. Very nice.

777
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:46,310
I noticed you two were holding
hands almost the entire time too.

778
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:50,720
That was very heartwarming. We like each
other. It's a habit. It's a nice habit.

779
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,630
Yeah. If you could hold
hands with her, wouldn't you?

780
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,680
I sure of what that was like a like a
kind of [inaudible] sort of reaching.

781
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:03,920
That was very sweet. Thank you guys for
doing this. Thank you so much. Thank you.

782
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,333
Oh,

783
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:14,830
so Conan. I always do that.
You know I'm in the room.

784
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,780
I'm sitting eight inches from you.

785
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:21,280
You acted like you were in a well and
you fell into the darkness and you're

786
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:25,720
wondering if I'm out there somewhere
and right here. Okay. Conan. Yeah.

787
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,460
The reviews are in for this podcast
we're doing. We're doing well.

788
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:34,210
We're doing well here. Your podcast
has five star ratings, which is great.

789
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,160
Five star out of how many stars out of
five I didn't know that was out of five.

790
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,390
Yeah, I thought that was out of 10 that's
exactly where my mind goes. Oh, okay.

791
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,650
That's just the way I've been raided by
most people in relationships that I've

792
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:51,940
been in. Five out of five. That's,
that's cool. Yeah. Okay. So far so good.

793
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,240
That's great. That's great.
What's, what are the,

794
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:56,350
what are the people out there thinking?
I want to know what they're thinking.

795
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,380
Well, we're going to read some
reviews. Okay. All right. So I'm gonna,

796
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,550
I'm gonna read some, yeah, yeah.
Keep saying you're going to do it.

797
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,830
But if you were a pitcher in
baseball and you're on the mine,

798
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,290
you're like gonna Pitch Pretty soon. Gun
to pitch the ball gun, a pitch the ball.

799
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:13,440
And you never did a Nav.

800
00:52:13,441 --> 00:52:18,190
Omar give you five stars and
their review is, it's not bad.

801
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:24,310
What? Yeah, it's not bad. And he's,
and he gave me five stars out of five.

802
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,390
Yes.
So wait,

803
00:52:25,391 --> 00:52:30,391
that guy goes in to an RBS and has a
perfectly mediocre sandwich and says,

804
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,380
Eh, it was edible. Five
out of five. He's, man,

805
00:52:35,381 --> 00:52:38,440
he's just handing out FiveStars
left and right. Not Bad.

806
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,170
How about life changing? So the
FiveStars is FiveStars is there. Well,

807
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,590
if you're going to write
something after five stars, right?

808
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,660
I now see what life is all about. Thank
you. Thank you. Conan. Don't right.

809
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:57,370
Not Bad. What? Sue, sue, ed, Sua dubs.

810
00:52:57,371 --> 00:53:01,210
Sue dubbs. No, sue dubs.
I was reading that wrong.

811
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:06,100
Sue Dubs said your podcast makes me
want to give you a hug. Oh, it's sweet.

812
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,220
Is it though or is it that
she feels sorry for me?

813
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,860
It could be she feels sorry
for you. It could be, oh,

814
00:53:11,861 --> 00:53:13,870
I listened to him and I
just want to give him a hug.

815
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,780
But I will also say when I was single,

816
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,860
pity was the motivating force
behind most of the women.

817
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,730
They had hooked up with me.

818
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,390
So pity is my friend. I think
she may pity me, but that's okay.

819
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,870
It doesn't matter. That's
something to brag about. Pity.

820
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,320
Pity was pity was my wing man.

821
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,830
That should be the name
of my autobiography.

822
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:46,740
Pity was my wing man by Conan O'brien.
I would, I'd like to hug her as well.

823
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,520
As long as it was all monitored
and was done. Um, you know,

824
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:55,210
appropriately it can match what?
Achy. Madge, icky, Madge I,

825
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,850
these are all screaming what's
going on? He can match, right?

826
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:05,280
He's a ginger. Gingers are people
too. Dot. Dot. Dot. Question Mark.

827
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,850
Oh my God,
this is brutal.

828
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:15,050
And we're a very well reviewed podcast
and these are the happy comments.

829
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,950
Yeah, I'm a ginger. All right.

830
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,710
And Ginger are people to Ginger's
I should have made that plural.

831
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:27,870
It ginger are people do, apparently
we're not, we can't even speak correctly.

832
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:31,050
Uh, yes. You know gingers are,

833
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:35,550
we are the one group that everyone
feels comfortable making fun of.

834
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,530
You know what I mean?
Like it,

835
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:41,220
think about it in this age
of extreme sensitivity.

836
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,400
You couldn't make that comment about any
other kind of person by the freckles.

837
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:52,620
Why would you focus on those? I
have a lot of freckles. You know,

838
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,510
a lot of them don't show up on camera on
TV. Of course they put makeup on. But,

839
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,620
um, my hands have a ton of
freckles. My, my hands look, uh,

840
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,910
they just look crazy.
They've got so many, right?

841
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,210
You've seen my hands when I come
back from like a Caribbean island,

842
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,790
I looked like a mummy that just
crawled it's way out of the tomb.

843
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,630
I was surprised when I met you
for the first time. Oh my God.

844
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:18,240
It speaks quarterly.
What are you talking about?

845
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,370
You were surprised the amount of freckles.

846
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,730
You didn't think I'd have that many
know. What else surprised you? Be Honest.

847
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:26,730
Guide the hightest. Uh, people
don't think I'm not tall.

848
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,340
Your presence is commanding.
Thank you. You're welcome. Oh,

849
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:35,240
you can't see this right now. But Gourley
is saluting me. Uh, he is saluting me, uh,

850
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,320
the way they do in the navy. Uh, so that,

851
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,440
so really seriously my height and then
freckles on my face or just in general.

852
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:47,670
I'm only joking, but yeah, you don't
see them on TV. You don't see him on TV.

853
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,150
They're actually becoming cause it,
it kind of, it's a part of you. Yes.

854
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:56,190
It makes me more human. They look good.
Well thank you. Yeah. Let me take it easy,

855
00:55:56,191 --> 00:56:00,150
pal. Yeah, I'll back off now. Yeah,
I'll cut this. No, no, no. I like this.

856
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:03,360
You want me to keep the one positive
thing we've really heard about me. Oh,

857
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:07,280
but three stars. Sorry. Yeah,
I get growly when he met me,

858
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:11,850
gave me three stars from my
physical appearance, but he
does like the podcast, so,

859
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,550
and he got that going. It was nice to him
to be cut in and say, that was nice. I,

860
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:19,110
I hope he doesn't cut that out or I
don't know. You don't care. I know.

861
00:56:19,111 --> 00:56:23,100
I don't know. Read another one. Let's
keep the sound. All right. Let's,

862
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:27,310
do you have trouble reading? No,
I'm just trying to choose ones. Oh,

863
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,570
by Matt. Matt. Matt. To
near the end of life.

864
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:35,380
It's important to record your voice
so that the family can listen back and

865
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:36,670
remember you fondly.

866
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,610
You think some at the end
of my life, maybe he knows
something that I don't know.

867
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,980
Eerie. Isn't that eerie? I
won't see. Think I am. I'm
not that old. What was that?

868
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:53,830
Some kind of veiled threat?
I hope so. You hope so. Yeah.

869
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,050
It gets my name in the papers.
You know,

870
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,640
the important thing is I always say that
when I don't know what I'm saying. Next

871
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,930
important thing is I do believe he's
correct that the recorded voice is

872
00:57:07,931 --> 00:57:10,530
important and I'm going to
say something else. Hmm.

873
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,670
This is me just freewheeling here.

874
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:17,470
People's last words used to be very
important and they talked about it a lot.

875
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:21,340
Do you know like with one of the
founding fathers was on his deathbed,

876
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:26,020
he'd say the republic still stands
and then he would die. You know?

877
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,590
Is that real? Did someone say that?
I think people said things like that.

878
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:30,760
People used to say things like,

879
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:34,660
and now I go to my rest
and then they would die.

880
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:37,780
Stonewall Jackson famously
when he was mortally wounded,

881
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,300
his last words were take me over
the river and into the trees. Oh,

882
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,000
beautiful. And then he passed
away and I was thinking about it.

883
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:50,950
There aren't last words anymore because
they keep us going forever and we're all

884
00:57:50,951 --> 00:57:53,650
hooked up. We have tubes in
our mouth and stuff at the end.

885
00:57:53,651 --> 00:57:57,820
So when I last words are like, Oh, oh,

886
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,330
do you know what I mean? I mean,
I'm not trying to be funny.

887
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,700
I'm not trying to make you laugh.
You know,

888
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:05,710
Picasso wasn't always
trying to make great art.

889
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:08,650
Sometimes he was just
scribbling on a Napkin.

890
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:13,651
But my point is that there are no last
words anymore because someone probably

891
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:17,920
says something really profound.
Like one of my time comes,

892
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:20,740
I'm going to try and say
something profound and I'm
going to say something like,

893
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,220
and now let us to the other
world and to the light,

894
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,740
but then a nurse is going
to come in and go, nope,

895
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:31,770
we can keep him going for another year
and inject all this shit into me and then

896
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:33,940
jam a tube in my throat and then
I got to spend a year going. Yeah.

897
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,613
Oh,

898
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:39,570
they're going to say,
what were his last words?

899
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,430
He said something kind of profound
a year ago. We'll wait. We'll wait.

900
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:47,220
What was that? I don't remember.
It was a year ago. What did he say?

901
00:58:47,221 --> 00:58:50,890
Just before he died?
Well,

902
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,240
those were his last words.

903
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,330
I think something's been lost.
Yeah.

904
00:58:58,450 --> 00:58:58,720
No.

905
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,580

This has been cocoa production
in association with,

918
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Hey, this is Arnie from the comedy
podcasts. Hello from the magic tavern,

919
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:08,060
a chat show I host from the magical land
of food with my cohost use at all the

920
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,520
blue wizard and chuck the shape shifter
most weeks we interview adventurers,

921
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,570
ambulatory trees.
We have a special episode.

922
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:21,660
I am so excited to learn about the earth
law contained in pride and prejudice.

923
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,760
We're going to do a book
club up pride and prejudice,

924
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,770
and you said this is a world
of book on Earth, right? Yeah.

925
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:31,390
It's one of those books that people love
or were forced to read or more likely.

926
01:00:31,391 --> 01:00:33,010
It's one of those I'm going to get to,

927
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:36,880
it's and some of our most
beloved of guests are a
churning to read the book with

928
01:00:36,881 --> 01:00:41,200
us and enjoy some drinks and food. Have a
book club. We are flower. We have chrome,

929
01:00:41,201 --> 01:00:43,810
the barbarian and girl.
You know who they are.

930
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,320
Maybe you don't give a crap about what
an academic thinks about Jane Austin,

931
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,620
but don't you want to know what a
wizard and a badge or think about it.

932
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:54,880
Not enough spells, not enough
grubs, not enough sword fights.

933
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:58,600
Whether you love pride and prejudice or
have no interest in reading it and just

934
01:00:58,601 --> 01:01:01,450
want to listen to a book club
going really off the rails.

935
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:05,540
You'll enjoy this week's hello from
the magic tavern. We shall defeat.
