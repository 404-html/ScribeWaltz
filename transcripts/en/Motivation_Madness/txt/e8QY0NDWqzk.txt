Speaker 1:          00:07          Well, oftentimes business education today, and I see it all the time, kids come out of college, the best colleges, wharton and Harvard and Stanford and some of the great business schools and they'll come out and they won't have practical experience is too many case studies that aren't practical. You know, we ask, uh, kids that are 16 to 18 years old to make $100,000 debt decisions when they go off to university and they're not prepared for that. They don't know what they're getting themselves into. They just assume, okay, I'm going to pay for years of education to 25,000 a pop and when I come out the other side, somehow we'll be able to pay it back. That's not how life works anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:42          There's no need even to have a college degree at all or even high school. I mean, if somebody graduated from a great university that maybe in indy, that may be an indication that they will be capable of great things, but it's not necessarily the case. You know, if you look at say people like Bill Gates or Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, these guys didn't graduate from college, but if you had a chance to hire them, of course I would be a good idea. Um, I think having the flexibility to explore a lot of different things which you can do when you're in college, which is one of the amazing things about being in college is you can work on all these hobbies and encode a lot of stuff and try a lot of different things. It's this amazing flexibility that I think most people take for granted and once you decide, okay, I'm going to start a company, I'm going to do it with someone else, you immediately now need to convince someone else if you want to change your mind on something.

Speaker 2:          01:35          And I think people really undervalue the option value and flexibility. I think explore what you want to do before committing is really like the key thing and keep yourself flexible and no, I think that that's agreed. Yeah. I mean it's actually kind of funny. I like if you're like, what is education? Like you're basically downloading data and algorithms into your brain and it's, it's, it's actually amazingly bad in conventional education because like it shouldn't be like this huge tour almost standing up there kind of lecturing at people and they've done the same lecturer or 20 years in a row and are very excited about it and in fact I think a lot of things that people learn it probably there's no point in learning because they never used them in the future because a lot of kids are in school. Kind of puzzled as to why they're there.

Speaker 3:          02:24          The people who are doing the work that we care about are figuring out what to do next, not following the person who told them what to do next. And the problem with most colleges is they are high school, but with more binge drinking. The entire purpose of a university is to give you a foundation to fail. Not a foundation to get an a. and if you graduated from college, straight a's, you have to do some serious soul searching as to why you chose to spend your time doing that.

Speaker 1:          02:50          A student's work for the students. The C students run the businesses and that these students dedicate the buildings. It's like the newspaper

Speaker 4:          03:00          industry ripe more printing presses, more big buildings, right? It makes us look grander. We have brains that we're putting them out there. There's there's a point of diminishing returns in terms of what it's worth for a college education and how much debt you're willing to saddle yourself with.

Speaker 5:          03:15          A lot of people fall. A lot of people have follow is generally. If not, we'd have problems. We have too many entrepreneurs. We have so many successful people. Look how many people go into business classes and everything you needed was in that actual business class. In that book, it'd be too many successful business people. Right? How many people graduate? Matter of fact, the professor wouldn't have the time to sit there and teach you that knows this book them near verbatim, page by page. He knows, right? Because he'd be an entrepreneur. He too busy. I'm too. I'm doing way too much right now because I got the palm trees and then we do it. We sell it so much stuff that I'm doing that I ain't quite got time to teach them about class right now because I'm winning

Speaker 4:          03:57          and so when you walk into a board room with a bunch of guys in suits who all went to college, you're fine.

Speaker 6:          04:05          Yeah, I mean because they read a bunch of words. I've lived a bunch of life. That's true. They're more degree, doesn't intimidate you. It kinda evens is out whether they know it and not get that self esteem from seriously. I mean most mom first and foremost, but then just living life like you know, being in real situations and happened to be a person of high integrity and honesty and you know, you never embarrassed yourself. Of course not. You'd ever walked in and said, hi, everybody thinks I'm ignorant here. I'm stupid. I don't feel ignorant right now. I don't. I felt like I came up in this situation or a time, you know, where I wasn't afforded certain opportunities and if afforded opportunities I could be oprah, could be a Bill Gates, I could be Warren Buffet.

Speaker 7:          04:56          In my experience in business, there is very little difference. If any, between a very high price business education and what's available a lot for a lot less money. I went to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. I last year in college. I went to wharton for a couple years before that. Uh, I learned just as much as university Nebraska as I did at wharton at indeed a big product in the right direction. But an awful lot of it is, is, is, is self. The self taught it isn't necessary to pay 30 or $35,000 a year. I go to some big name school to get the education at all. I mean, if you're going to learn accounting, if you're going to, which is the probably the most important course you'd taken business, you're gonna learn to count. You can learn accounting absolutely as well in my view, going to you all. It was going to Harvard. I mean, I, I see, uh, I would, I would, I bet on that. And uh, so I wouldn't run up huge bells

Speaker 8:          05:59          and education is very good at training people to do the same things that we've done over and over again. And I think there's always a question what the nature of the educational good is. A, you can say it's a, it's an investment. Good. We're investing in the future. You can say it's a consumption good. Like college is a four year party, you know, I think most of the parents and students think of it actually is an insurance policy where you're buying this really ever more expensive insurance so that the students don't fall through the really big cracks in our society. And we should be asking some big questions why the insurance costs are going up and up like that. And if you were the president of Harvard or Stanford, if you want it to get, um, a lynch mob of students, alumni, faculty to come after you and try to lynch you, what you should say is something like this. You know, we, we live in this much larger, more global world. We offer a great education to everybody and so we're going to double or triple our enrollment over the next 15 to 20 years. And people would, they'd all be furious because the value of the degrees comes from this massive exclusion. Um, and, and what you're really running is something like a studio 54 nightclub.

Speaker 9:          07:07          I hate it. I hated school. I hated school. I hated school generally, right? Because it was this instruction following thing. Now I bet you it's probably also because I wasn't good at it and some people are like, I've got a great conceptual memory and a terrible rote memory. So if I have a story I could tell you year by year kind of what happened, um, within a story, within a context a. But if I was to go into, you know, like a memory based learning, it's terrible. I have a terrible rote memory. Ego Barrier is the worst thing. And if we were raised differently, just imagine in the schools at all along that people will always say everybody makes mistakes. Everybody has weaknesses. The key is really to understand what your mistakes and weaknesses are so that you can learn from them. Right? I think punishment is, is it is a terrible concept.

Speaker 9:          08:09          Punishment means that you made a mistake and you're being punished. I think instead of punishment, every time somebody makes a mistake, you just say, the only thing that you need to do to get out of your punishment is first think what kind of mistake was that? So if I'm in this situation that's like that again, how would I do deal with it differently not to make that mistake? So that learning should come from the mistake, not punishment, because you're teaching people not to make mistakes. We're, whereas where the learning comes from, not the appreciation that if you keep doing this over and over again, you're going to keep encountering the same outcomes.

Speaker 8:          08:55          You know, it's an extremely, a corrupt system. We have at this point, there is, we have an education bubble in the US. We have a trillion dollars of student debt to a first approximation. This has gone to pay for a trillion dollars worth of lies about the value of the education people have received. Um, and um, and I, it's not at all obvious yet though, what's going to, what's going to replace this or how it's going to change. Um, my um, you know, the, the, uh, you know, the, and I'm somewhat skeptical that it will be replaced by any sort of single unitary system and I have this fellowship for a young people to start companies and it's not, my claim is not that everybody should do this. I don't think everyone should become an entrepreneur. And I think, I think there is no one size fits all.

Speaker 8:          09:45          I think so. I think the future will be much more heterogeneous, much more diverse in terms of what people do. Um, and uh, what's, what's really anomalous is the sort of unitary tracking where you have to go to an elite college, you go to Yale or you go to jail, there's nothing else you can do, you know. Um, and so the, the, uh, I think the universities are perhaps in perhaps in the same place as the Catholic Church was in 1,514. If we go back 500 years where, uh, you have sort of a monolithic way, you this universal way of a body of knowledge of teaching things. The difference between the Yale and the Harvard political science faculties are probably no greater than the differences between the Dominicans and the Franciscans. We've all kinds of small debates within this context. Um, uh, we are, we have a system of indulgences that's costing more and more to support this priestly or professorial class of people.

Speaker 8:          10:41          We are told that, uh, it's the only way to salvation. You must get a diploma to be saved. If you do not get a diploma, then you will go to hell. Um, and I think, um, and I think the, uh, I think the, the, the message that I have that's like the 16th century reformers, that's a somewhat troubling message is that you have to work out your salvation on your own. You have to save yourself. And, uh, and, and that's, that's, I think, I believe that is the truth. But it's a, it's, it's, it's somewhat uncomfortable with.
