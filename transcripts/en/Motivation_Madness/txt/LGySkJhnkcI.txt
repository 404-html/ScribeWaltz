Speaker 1:          00:07          All results. Reasons don't count. Parks will always point out reasons on why they are not living their dream on why they are not manifesting their greatness. They will always be able to point those things out, but none of those things count. The only thing that counts or results and results don't lie. Ladies and gentlemen, they tell it all judge a tree by the fruit that it bears, not the ones that it might talk about, not the ones that it might wish for, but the fruit that it actually bears. The people that are committed are busy doing it, but I think that some of us are producing results in our lives that that level of commitment brains that we particularly don't like or find is tasteful. You want to take care of yourself. I don't think that as a participant in life, you cannot be committed. You either committed to mediocrity or you're committed to greatness. You're either committed to being productive or you're committed to being nonproductive. You committed to being happy, or you're committed to being unhappy. Once I look at how you commit your time one time doing an evaluation on how you spend your time. I can tell you exactly what you're committed to. People that say they have dreams or one open a business or want to do something differently than what they're now doing. They don't like their jobs. They're unhappy, they're unfulfilled. People said they want to improve their income level. Look at how they spend their time. Commitment shows up in your life and what you do.

Speaker 2:          01:48          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:49          you can make the commitment to your life, but you don't like the results that you have and that you're going to do something about it. See, that power is available to all of us. People who look at life and decide, I want something different for myself. So most people like them using the language, they don't want to commit themselves because commitment means among many things. No, it's stills is acceptable.

Speaker 3:          02:21          You decided that you want to Jill this if it becomes pop and then do it if it difficult, if it's inconvenient. So what? What would your life be like if you decided to keep your commitments? What we'll all have our lives be like if we decided to keep our commitments that we decided to do the things that we said that we were going to do, but we wouldn't even speak it unless we were going to do it right. I will do anything unless I'm going to do it. At the end of the seven days, you'll feel strong and powerful. There's nothing as powerful as the human spiritual, Qantas, it. When you are committed, you're dancing to the beat of a different drummer. Don't expect people to understand. Don't expect it to make sense to anybody. Why you got to do this? Why do you have got to go? Why did you leave this as a good job? They take you away from retirement. I'm going, why? I don't understand. You don't have to

Speaker 1:          03:29          look to this day for it is life. The very life of light in its brief costs lie, all the realities and their of existence, the bliss of growth, the splendor of action, the glory of power for yesterday is but a dream. And tomorrow is only a vision. But today, the day well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness. And every tomorrow a vision of hope. Look well. Therefore to this day.
