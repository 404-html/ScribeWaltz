Speaker 1:          00:08          I had so many dreams of where I wanted to go, who I want it to be, and what I wanted to do. Theater companies. I wanted to start with classmates, movies. I wanted to be in directors. I wanted to work with stories. I read it to tell, it might take a little time I thought, but it would happen when I sat there, excuse me, 22 years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38          What I didn't want to think about is where I would be tomorrow, what I would have to start to do tomorrow. And I graduated in 1991 a great year, uh, time of resurgence for independent films in this country at a time of relatively affordable rents in New York City. See, I assumed that I could make a living writing my place, acting way off, off, off Broadway and hopefully one day join the actors I loved and respected in those independent films. TV. Oh, what? No. What? Are you kidding me?

Speaker 2:          01:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30          No, didn't even consider that I have much more class than that. Much more self respect than that.

Speaker 2:          01:38          Soap operas and ship.

Speaker 1:          01:42          What I didn't have was cash

Speaker 2:          01:48          a bank account,

Speaker 1:          01:50          credit card or an apartment.

Speaker 2:          01:56          I just had debt. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:05          Big, hungry, growing larger every moment. Debt, so as you will tomorrow. I had to leave beautiful Vermont. I pack the life that I knew with socks and a toothbrush into my backpack and I slept on couch after couch after couch after couch at friend's apartments in New York until I wore out their rent. Pang roommates welcome. I didn't want a day job. I was an actor. I was a writer. I was at Bennington graduate. I had to get a day job. I dusted pianos at a piano store on ludlow street for five months. I worked on the property of a shakespeare scholar for a year, pulling weeds and removing bees nests. I went on unemployment ones, but for not for long. I couldn't handle the guilt. Eventually I was able to pay rent for a spot on the floor of an apartment on the lower east side, but my roommate had a breakdown and disappeared. He later resurfaced in a religious cult. I'm making this sound romantic. It really wasn't it.

Speaker 2:          03:35          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:37          I helped hang paintings at galleries, paintings. That inspired inspire you to think I could do that.

Speaker 2:          03:49          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          03:50          and then finally, after two years of job and couch surfing, I got a job in application processing as it data end juror at a place called professional examination services and I stayed for six years, six years longer than my time at Benning from the age of 23 to 29 board. They loved me there. I was funny. I wear black, no cape, no tights.

Speaker 2:          04:46          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:46          I smoked in the loading docks with the guys from the mail room and we shared how hung over. We all were.

Speaker 2:          04:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Everyone. You called each other's shorty?

Speaker 2:          04:56          I don't know.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Seven shorty. Hey, you doing shoddy or so hung over? Shorter.

Speaker 2:          05:03          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:04          I called in sick almost every Friday because I was out late the night before. I hated that job and I clung to that job because of that job. I could afford my own place. So I lived in Williamsburg. Brooklyn. Yeah. You say that now my kingdom for a time machine.

Speaker 2:          05:37          No.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Yeah, that's right. I lived in an industrial loft. My rent was $400 a month. My dream of running a theater company with my friend, fellow Bennington graduate, Ian Bell had died. I won't go into those details, but neither one of us had any business sense. And the theater we lived in, it had no heat or hot water. We didn't smell very good, but we had our youth. The youth gets old very quickly. You'll see. So Ian moved out to Seattle and I moved up to the street to my loft and I still didn't have heat in 1993 industrial loft men not legal to live there. I didn't see, I don't want this to sound cool and I feel like it's sending cool

Speaker 2:          06:43          ad Lib.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Uh, but I did have hot water, hot water in my bathroom, which a friend of mine using said bathroom once shouted. It smells exactly like a summer camp in here.

Speaker 2:          07:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:01          It was true for some reason in the middle of Brooklyn, there was earth in my shower. Sure Earth and then, oh look, mushrooms growing from the earth. But I, I was safe though. The ideal fire control company was right across the street where they make all the chemicals that put out chemical fires. I did not fear a chemical fire. I would be okay. And all those chemicals in the air. We're okay too because up the street we had the spice factory. They made spices and that just covered everything up in a nice cumins centers. I had a rat, but that was okay cause I got a cat.

Speaker 2:          07:51          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          07:52          his name was Brian. No relation. My grandmother had given me a pink pullout couch. Oddly new friends or recent graduates wanted to crash on my couch. So I put the couch on its end so brian could climb it and look out the window. I had only the one window. I myself could not look out the window. It was, it was quite high. So I had no heat. No girlfriend. What are you kidding me? No acting agent. But I had a cat named Brian who told me of the world outside. I stayed for 10 years.

Speaker 2:          08:51          Yes.

Speaker 1:          08:53          No, don't pity me.

Speaker 2:          08:55          There's a

Speaker 1:          08:55          happy ending.

Speaker 1:          09:01          When I was 29 I told myself the next acting job I get, no matter what it pays, I will from now on for better or worse be a working actor. So I quit my position at the professional examination services. My friends really weren't happy about that because he was so easy to find me when I work there work was, there was the only place I had the internet. This was at the beginning of the Internet and now I didn't have either the internet or a cell phone or a job, but something good happened. I got a low ping theater job in a play called imperfect love, which led to a film called 13 moons with the same writer, which led to other roles which led to other roles and I've worked as an actor ever since.

Speaker 2:          10:01          Bye.

Speaker 1:          10:04          Didn't know that would happen at 29 walking away from data processing, I was terrified. 10 years in a place without heat, six years at a job I felt stuck in. Maybe I was afraid of change. Are you? My parents didn't have much money, but they struggled to send me to the best schools. And one of the most important things they did for me and graduates, maybe you don't want to hear this, is that once I graduated I was on my own. Financially it was my turn. Herons are applauding graduates or not. This made me very hungry. Literally I couldn't be lazy. Now I'm totally lazy, but back then I couldn't be. And so at 29 and a very long last, I was in the company of the actors and writers and directors. I had sought out that first year, that first day after school I was, I am by their sides, raise the rest of your life to meet you. Don't search for defining moments because they will never come. Well the birth of your children, okay, of course, that's just six months. She's, my life is forever changed and that's much defining moment ever. But I'm talking about in the rest of your life. And most importantly in your work, the moments that define you have already happened and they will already happen again

Speaker 1:          12:15          and it passes so quickly. So please bring each other along with you. Everyone you need is in this room. These are the shiny more important people.

Speaker 2:          12:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          12:49          sorry. It sucks after graduation. It really does.

Speaker 2:          12:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:57          I mean, I don't know. At least it did for me, but that's the only thing I know you do. You just get a bit derailed, but soon something starts to happen. Trust me. Rhythm sets in just like it did after your first few days here.

Speaker 2:          13:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:20          Just try not to wait until like me, your 29 before you find it and if you are, that's fine too. Some of us never find it, but you will. I promise you, you are already here. That's such an enormous step. All its own. You'll find your rhythm or continue the one you, I've already found. I was walking downtown in Manhattan the other day and I was approached by a group of very sweet young ladies, easy actually there. Erm, sort of running fever actually down the street after me. When they got to meet breathless. It was really, they didn't know what to say or couldn't form the words, but it came out that they were Nyu freshmen and they were majoring in musical theater. Of course. Come on in. We're like science majors. We were running after me. What musicals are you doing? I inquired. Well, one of them said, looking down at her shoes, we aren't allowed to be in plays our yet. Our freshman year now. They were paying very high tuition. Yeah, tuning, not do what they love doing. I think I said, well, hang in there.

Speaker 2:          15:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:15          What I should have said was don't wait until they tell you you are ready. Get in there. Sing. We're quickly transferred to Benington.

Speaker 2:          15:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          15:44          when I went to school here, if a freshman wanted to write direct and star in her own musical, the lights would already be hung for her.

Speaker 2:          15:56          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:57          Now I tell this story because the world might say you are not allowed to yet.

Speaker 2:          16:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:10          I waited a long time out in the world before I gave myself permission to fail.

Speaker 2:          16:18          Please

Speaker 1:          16:21          don't even bother asking. Don't bother telling the world you are ready.

Speaker 2:          16:29          Show it. Do it. What did Beckett say?

Speaker 1:          16:40          Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.

Speaker 2:          16:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:54          Bennington, class of 2012 the world is yours. Treat everyone kindly and light up the night. Thank you so much for having me here.

Speaker 2:          17:10          [inaudible].
