Speaker 1:          00:01          Some decisions or major decisions and also there are a lot of small decisions that we don't make that they tax our minds. They drain our energy. They create a lot of anxiety and nervousness and mental torment because we don't take care of it. We decide not to decide which is the decision. Deciding to decide to act is a major, major challenge for all of us at different points in different areas of our lives and there are things that happened to us along the way. Experiences that we have that prevent us from working through the mental block of acting, of doing those things that we know we ought to do. And so what I want you to think about is what is there that you know you need to do that you want to do this, but for some reason or another, you've been holding back for some reason or another.

Speaker 1:          01:07          You just have not been able to gather your nerves or be able to work through all the procrastinating or putting it off or justifying or blaming some reason or another. You just haven't done it and you know you ought to do this. You really want to do this, but you don't know why you haven't done it. Anybody know what I'm talking about? Raise your hand. Believes okay, then I've got company here this evening. I'm not talking to myself now. First, all we know that this is not easy because in order to begin to reinvent your life, you've got to make a conscious, deliberate, determined effort.

Speaker 2:          01:43          Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:44          That you really have got to put all of yourself into it. It's very challenging to add to do those things that at times when you're looking at him, you say, I know I need to do this, but I don't feel like it. I don't want to do it. I know I need to do it yet. Leave me alone. No, I don't want to do it. So what do we do? What are those things that cause us to do like that? I think that among the things that prevent us from acting, it's the fear of failure and if you've already failed, you don't want to fail again. The pain of that, the disappointment, the fear of loss is another thing because many times when we do those things that we know we need to do, we feel that we might lose somebody that we love very much and care about.

Speaker 1:          02:38          We don't want to hurt anybody. Many of us don't act because we want other people's approval. We want everybody to like us and to accept us. And that's not possible. Many of us don't do the things that we want to do and don't act because of lack of self confidence. We don't believe enough in ourselves. I have friend who's been working on a job where she's miserable, talented, want to go to another place that she can do what she wants to do and make the kind of money that she would like to make and have had some offers. But because of her fear and how the lack of self confidence, uh, things might not work out, she won't take a chance on yourself. So there she is spending eight hours a day, five days a week, and she's miserable. She hates to go to work. They're not paying on what she's watching knows it, but yet instill, she won't do that, which she knows she much to do and it's wearing out that a lot of people that their jobs are making them sick because they want to act. You check out the absenteeism and the people that are depressed. You see, I'm coming to work angry. How you doing?

Speaker 3:          03:53          No,

Speaker 1:          03:57          just leave me alone. It's not even 9:00 yet. You're talking about good morning. That days you got to work. You want to just keep driving past a job. You know you don't want to stop because it's not in sync with who you are, but you haven't acted. Have another friend. He's got brilliant. He's a business consultant. He helped a lot of people get their business started and people come to him because they know he's knowledgeable, but this guy wants to start his own business now. He's very smart. He can do it. Everybody believes in it except him and he's so smart. He's talked himself out of the well, the numbers aren't right,

Speaker 1:          04:43          so there are many reasons why we don't act. There are other things though that affect us is that not wanting to take personal responsibility. We want somebody else to do it, and we, many times we pick up our inability to do certain things from people that we love, people that we admire, we identify with them and we live in the context of their ideas, their opinions and their life patterns. We buy into it unconsciously. My mother is a pack rat. She keeps everything. She doesn't throw anything away and I have unconsciously picked that up. Now my mother never said, let me show you how to keep everything less than just clutter things.

Speaker 1:          05:34          I unconsciously picked that up many times. Unconsciously. We tried to honor the people we love by being like them. By the same token, I realized something about myself when I had some major decisions to make and I find myself acting like my mother. My mother mother's the kind of person that when she has a problem with one of the other foster that she adopted, she won't confront them. She will call me last. Why don't you tell lender to move? She's lazy. She won't go to work. She runs the street all day and then she comes home and wants to sleep all day and I think she's doing droughts. I said, but Mama, why don't you tell Linda that I bought the house for you. I told you when she wanted to come home, don't let a grown person come there and take care of them. You let her in will after all she is my Mama. Then you handle that. When I tell her to leave, she say, mama say I can say Mama, can I say and you tell her yes, and then you call me and say she's still here. Why worry me with this? So Mama hasn't developed the courage to act on that. Some people won't act until there's a crisis situation. When Linda stopped stealing from Mama and took us social security check to get some drugs, mama got some cars to say get outta here

Speaker 1:          07:07          would ever come back, but she wouldn't do it until then and say, we don't have to wait until a crisis situation. I have a friend that had been having a challenge with losing weight. Both of us had been dealing with that challenge and for the past 40 years is always seemed like weighed over 235 pounds and so he said, man, I just can't lose weight. I'm big boned it. I say, I've never seen any fat skeleton. No, you need to act on your health. You can change this. Well, you don't have to go to your grave fat. We're all digging early grades without teeth. We don't have to do this. They need to have a support group around m and m peanuts. You want a support group on something and throw snickers in there too.

Speaker 1:          08:03          I can tell you about the help we need with that. So what happened with bud though, he became ill a few weeks ago, so he bought in the last few weeks, has lost more weight than is ever lost. Even when we were competing with each other, betting a lot of money. But what happened was bob became diabetic. He went into an insulin shock. He didn't know that he was diabetic, his blood sugar became high and the doctor said to him, you are diabetic. You're going to have to have insulin shots every day. You're gonna have to change your diet and let me tell you what's going to happen if you don't do what we tell you to do. Number one, there's a possibility that you can become an amputee. Number two, you can go blind. Three, you can become impotent bugs. They help me

Speaker 4:          08:58          when? When, when, when bro got to jail and guys say, can I do to be saved? You want one my peanut butter and jelly sandwiches? No, I said, but I can't believe you're eating vegetables. You're exercising, jogging in place. Now, he had the ability to do,

Speaker 1:          09:24          do it before, but there are some people. It takes that kind of crises to bring them into reality in order for them to act in their own best interests. Some people have to hit rock bottom in order to ride. I don't know why you want to begin to look out on your life and what you want for you, and I think that when we began to focus in the area of what does it take for us to act, I think we can say events can inspire us to act at that particular event in his life circumstances. Friend of mine, he wanted to do something and he just did not have the motivation and the drive and the confidence within himself, but as circumstances change overnight through an acquisition of a company that he worked for, he lost his job. Through the inspiration of desperation, he had to act the life also of things that can inspire us, that see, we don't have the courage, and that's what it takes. Courage. It takes guts to do that. What you know you need to do. If you don't have the courage to act live, many times we'll move on you and make you at live will whoop your butt so bad. You will be so miserable. You will get so much how you say, yes, I will do it. What do you want me to do? Take me

Speaker 1:          11:04          friend of mine say, I can't stop smoking. I can't stop smoking. Dr Said Sam Axelrod, you have emphysema. Sam never picked up another cigarette and said, look of stupid people smoking. Sam, you did it for 35 years. How can you talk about people? While I was different, I'm trying to help them.

Speaker 4:          11:24          They don't

Speaker 1:          11:26          do the same thing I did, but be compassionate now. Isn't an interesting how quickly we forget, so I'm saying that look at something in your life. It might be just writing a letter to somebody to say thank you. It might be just to apologize to somebody. I had a confrontation and the penobscot building with the security guard there. He responded to me what I perceived as a negative way and he and I engaged in an argument. I did not like the way I handled that. I avoided going through the front door for a long time because I didn't want to face it. Finally I decided to act and I went up to him and said, I want to apologize to you for the way in which I handled this argument we had. The other day. I was wrong. I hope you accept my apology. He said I do.

Speaker 1:          12:13          And I said, thank you very much. I felt relieved. Now when you decide to act, it's not always going to be like that. A friend of mine did some work for me. It was below par to say the least. I knew that this guy was capable of doing better work. I knew that he also had a fragile ego, so I was trying to think of what is the most sensitive way in which I can share this information with him because I wanted him to do my work over. I was going to pay him for what he did, but I needed my work done right. But I was afraid that I would hurt his feelings. So I was very, very meticulous and how I approached him and I said, let me share this with you. You know, I care about you and that you are very talented and gifted person and you and I both know that what you have given me is not a true reflection of your talents and abilities. And I'm saying, let's go back in the studio and do this again. And he said to me, I'm going to forget you ever said that.

Speaker 1:          13:21          I was wiped out. He never spoke to me again. Now when you decide to act, you're going to have some people like that. We're no longer friends. I lost sleep over that. Ladies and gentlemen, I said, I can't believe that. I remember setting up one night looking at the phone. I said, I got call him. Said, no, that's it. No, forget that. I see men looking. We've been knowing each other too long to allow this to come between us. He said, don't call me anymore. And Hung Up. And then I wanted to think about how, what can I do to make it up to him? And then something came to me less. What do you have to prove? So many things. We don't do it because in fact, we want people to like us. That's unnecessary losses in life. When you decide acting in your best interest, you're going to lose some friends. Everybody's not going to approve of you. There are some people that work like you. Who Do you think you are? You are arrogant. What do you think you can do? You think you'd get away with that? You're selfish. Thanks, I got that.

Speaker 1:          14:29          It's my life, and so what I'm saying to you is that as you begin to look out on your life, this is challenging. This is not easy acting, so one of the things that we can begin to do to harness our will, number one, you've got to bring it out and look at it. You got to take the power out of it. You've got to it to the truth, and the truth is that it has no power over you, so write down something you want to act on, but for some reason that you've been holding back and look at it. The next thing is ask yourself the question, is it helping you to continue to put it off? If it's an asset for you to continue to procrastinate, then continue to do that, but if it's a liability for you, if it's causing you some mental and some emotional challenges or perhaps a financial problem, look at that. Examine that for what it is. Next step. Ask Yourself, what's blocking you? What's preventing you from acting? Why don't you have the courage to handle that? Why won't you face that? What are you running away from? What kind of avoidance behavior are you engaged in?

Speaker 1:          15:46          Next is what is the worst thing that can happen when you take action? So I looked at that and I said, what's the worst thing can happen when I tell him this? He can say, I don't like you any did. Now what happened? I experienced that. I looked at that, I saw that. And guess what? Ladies and gentlemen, I didn't dye my feelings were hurt a little bit. I lost some sleep about it and sometimes I think about it when I drive past his house, but I'm still here. It's uncomfortable, but it's okay. It doesn't bother me anymore. I've gotten used to it now. So what is the worst thing that can happen? I want you to visualize that experience, that feel, the nervousness and the discomfort and the more you run into in your mind the less power that it will have. Next is how will you feel after taking this action? I felt a sense of personal achievement

Speaker 1:          16:48          when I faced somebody that has been my mentor for years and for years that was something I wanted to tell him and I didn't have the courage to tell him because it was always I was a student. He wants to teach her. It was always. I looked up to him and admired him and held him in high esteem and I was always grateful and thankful for the impact that he had on my life. And I loved him so much. I didn't have the courage to say to him, please stop drinking so much you an alcoholic, you need help. I didn't have the courage because I was afraid that he might not like me. I was afraid that he might be hurt and crushed, that we would no longer be friends. I didn't want to jeopardize what we had.

Speaker 1:          17:40          I loved him a great deal and I didn't. I didn't know how this would affect our relationship and I didn't even want him to know that I knew that he was an alcoholic and so I was a cow, spineless and the name of law. I did it to justify to myself to stop from helping somebody that I loved from dying. I said, I love him so much. I just can't tell him this. I don't even know how he would handle it. To know that I know that he's an alcoholic, and finally after years I developed the courage to face my teacher, my mentor who has molded me, who looks at me now and wanted to do what I'm doing now and did not do. It. Came at a different time and it wasn't time for what he brought and he's living through me and I had to face this man who's been like a father to me.

Speaker 1:          18:38          It's, I got to tell you something. You've got a problem. I love you very much. Please stop drinking. You're killing yourself. It's not just social. You do it every day. You need help and whatever. I can do to support you in that. I will please stop, and he looked at me and I had no idea what, how he was going to handle that at first that was like, I dare you, and we just looked at each other and then I reached out to embrace him and we never ever embrace man. Macho never hugged me. I hugged him and he just stood there with his arms straight. He couldn't raise his arms to hug me back and he was shocked and after he got over the initial shock when you could bring him stuff to speak, to maintain his composure because he could never afford to let me, his students see him vulnerable or admit that I was right. He said, I'll be seeing you. I said, yes sir.

Speaker 1:          19:50          I said, tell you why. Be by the house to see the car before I leave. And when he walked away, at first I was very depressed about it and I said, well, maybe it wasn't my place to do this and that. You know, when you act, you're going to have some second thoughts. And then I said, no, no, no. I did what I felt I did it because I feel very strongly about this and fortunately he called me back a few weeks later and left word with the answering service les, Les Brown. I just want to say thank you

Speaker 3:          20:31          and hung up.

Speaker 1:          20:34          I was a good feeling. When we look out on our lives, you asked the question, what are you going to do? Look at as you think about this that you know need to handle, what are you going to do? And then write down three strong reasons on why you know you must take action and being explicit and descriptive in your reasons because your reasons have power. Your reasons will drive you when you have doubt, when your faith becomes weak, your reasons will fortify your faith. When you have an inner conversation, say no, don't do that. Your reasons will become your rod and your staff to convert you, to take you through those challenging moments,

Speaker 1:          21:24          so write down your reasons and what you will find, but when you decide to act, when you decided to take life on, and let me warn you, it can be painful. It will be uncomfortable and that's where the growth is. When you're uncomfortable, when you're stretching up, when you're taking a life bother collar, you're going to get thrown to the ground again and again and again, but when you had the termination and you know that what you're doing is right, it gives you your life. It gives us special meeting and power to you. You will have some power from on high. You will discover some things about yourself. Then we'll begin to electrify your personality. You'll begin to discover some things about you, but you don't know you've got. When you put yourself in that type of challenging situation,

Speaker 4:          22:16          repeat after me please. I can go into action

Speaker 5:          22:21          on anything in my life. Nothing is stopping me but me. No challenge in my life has any power over me.

Speaker 4:          22:36          Here's something that Howard Thurman wrote on the decision to act. He said it's a wondrous thing, that a decision to act releases energy and the personality for days on end, a person may drift along without much energy, having no particular sense of direction and having no will to change. Then something happens to alter the pattern. It may be something very simple and inconsequential in itself, but it stabs awake. It alarms, it disturbs in a flash. One gets a vivid picture of one self and it passes. The result is decision, Sharp, definitive decision and the wake of the decision, yes. Even as a part of the decision itself, energy is released. The act of decision sweeps all before it and the life of the individual maybe changed.

Speaker 4:          23:43          When did you decide to make decisions to act? You began to access power within you that will increase your self esteem, that will increase and enhance your personal power, but that puts you in charge of life and life has a whole new meaning for you as a sense of personal freedom. Doesn't mean you're not gonna. Have any struggles, doesn't mean that you're not gonna have any challenges. Doesn't mean that you're not going to suffer any defeat. No, no, no. It doesn't mean bad, but what it does mean that you're putting yourself in the position to grow. You're putting yourself in line with your higher calling and your highest self,

Speaker 3:          24:33          and

Speaker 4:          24:37          that's what life is about.

Speaker 3:          24:42          Thank you. This affirmation, please everybody stand please. I'm standing up to live

Speaker 5:          25:03          and the challenges in my life. I'm going to use all of me, all of my courage, my faith, determination, and any help and support that I can give anyone to realize that greatness together we can shake somebody's hand on your right and left and say, you got what it takes.
