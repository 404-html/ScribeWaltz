Speaker 1:          00:18          Old Chinese proverb. Most people have heard it or have come across it at some point in the meanings. Pretty straightforward, right? And advocates. Having the courage to take that step towards the goal and that's cute and I'm making that decision to move forward towards something you want, but it's what happens immediately following that first step that I'm interested in. What happens when the journey's be gone and it's you and your goal in all of a sudden you realize how long that road ahead really is. Now this is a turning point for a lot of people and those who can succeed or able to take their daunting, intimidating goal or journey and see it for what it really is. Just a bunch of small, manageable tasks strung together. You know, when you look at why people quit, a lot of the time it's because they were overwhelmed by their goals and ambitions. Let's say you have this wonderful plan in your head to climb a mountain. You're thinking about that feeling of being on top, looking down with pride. Every time you think about it, your heart starts racing, so you pack your stuff. You make your way down in the base of the mountain and then you look up

Speaker 1:          01:42          different ballgame right now, the entire mountains in front of you and you realize that that's no small feat. That is when people walk away, when they aren't able to see a challenge as the sum of tiny steps. They see it as a crazy, impossible task. It's like saying you want to be the next Tom Brady or coby bryant to tall mountain to climb, like trying to hit a target from a mile away, but if you can identify and map out what you need to conquer in order to become a better basketball player or football player and begin taking those small steps improving every day, that makes dreams real. That's what gives goals life. The ability to see your objective not as a marathon, but as a series of little 400 meters stretches, stepping stones. You know what your objective is today, tomorrow, the end of the week and the end of the year, and then completing them day by day. These little victories, that's what gives your dream life. It's what gives you momentum. You feel good about the process. And by the way, when things blow up in your face, which happens every so often on this little place call earth, you'll have that foundation and that sense of accomplishment to stay focused because you're approaches tangible and it's realistic.

Speaker 1:          03:10          This applies with everything. Losing a job, a breakup, failing a test. These things that are monumental. If you allow them to be, you know, they can turn into that unclimbed double mountain or they can roll the map a new path for you. And if you define what you want, you define success and begin stepping towards it one hour, one day at a time, you'll get where you want to be quicker than you thought.
