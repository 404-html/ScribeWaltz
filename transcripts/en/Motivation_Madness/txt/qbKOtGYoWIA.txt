Speaker 1:          00:08          The one commodity that is most valuable. Oh, and this earth is time, time to love, to live. From the moment the human body is born, it begins dying. I don't think you, man, you quite caught that. Let me say it again. From the moment the human body is born, it begins dying. Some happening faster, some happening slower. Some of US help them happy, go faster. Some of them prevented from happening sooner than later. Coach high coming to you live on the field of life. How many seconds? How many minutes do we waste every day? Doing things that are nowhere near the goals and aspirations and passions that we have inside. How many times are you go through the course of a day and realize, did I do anything I set out to do today? Write down those goals each and every day. No matter if there's two goals a day. If you can accomplish those, then you're doing more than just making it through the day you are living and achieving your dreams.

Speaker 1:          01:23          You know as inspirational speakers, we don't want to just talk to you. We want to live that as well. I've done that in my life as well. Find time to better yourself. Read, explore research, live life, do things you've never thought of doing before. That's what it's all about when you're born, that's their date that they put on the left side of the tombstone. When you die, they put another date on the right side of the tombstone, but that dash in the middle is the most important thing on that tombstone. That is alone. That throughout that entire timeframe you were able to impact and touch others lives. You were able to leave your mark on this earth. You were able to build a legacy there. Nobody could change. You were able to have it to where people remember who you are, no matter what. When you're living for that dash in the middle, you're going to remember your why, your why. Why are you here, not, not the why. Why did you do something your why, your reason for getting up in the morning, your reason for pushing yourself past the brink of exertion and given up your reason for moving on and and and getting things done in life. That dash in the middle. That's the thing that pushes you.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Just stop for a second. Write down your why. What are you doing this for in life? If your does it make you cry and that's not your why. Again, if your why doesn't make you cry, then that's not your why. Your why should be something so big that it moves your family tree. Your why should be something so big that it changes the whole outlook on how things are with you and your home, your family, your religion, your purpose. Think about your passion, thinking about your opportunities and that's how you find your purpose. OPP.

Speaker 2:          03:37          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:37          When ned, why meets up with your passion, your opportunity, your purpose, then you'll find out the most important day in your life is the day you remember why you were born,

Speaker 2:          03:58          how you can live an easy life. You know, accomplishing goals and be successful and going out in the world and as tough. The only way to live an easy life is to basically give up on all your dreams and aspirations and just sit around doing nothing. Shit that is easy is not worth accomplishing. Therefore a life that is easy. It's not even worth living. Nothing in this world is worth having, are doing unless it means effort, pain, and difficulty. Would you listen to me? He used to be good. You are going to die. All of you, all your friends, your family, everyone you know, everyone you care about, it's going to die if you love life, not waste time because time is what life is made of.

Speaker 3:          04:54          So if you respect and appreciate the time that you've been given, one, you out there doing what you want to do, where you need to be telling yourself is it's an acceptable to be seen around the procrastinate. And I no longer wanted to be a loser. I no longer want to be awkward. I know what it is that I want and I'm going to work hard and I'm going to get it.

Speaker 4:          05:12          When you want to succeed, as bad as you want to breathe, then you'll be successful. Someone you lost late morning. My success, and I'm here to tell you today, if you're going to be successful, you've got to be willing to give up sleep. You gotta be willing to work on for three hours of sleep, two hours. If you really want to be successful, some days you will have to stay up three days in a row,

Speaker 5:          05:36          but you don't need to if you don't really want it. How badly are you wanting success rather than actually working towards your dreams? A lot of you are just thinking about it. I have high hopes for everybody watching this. I want to remember your name.

Speaker 6:          06:00          It is not the things we do in life that we regret on our deathbed. It is the things we do, not because I assure you I've done a lot of really stupid things. None of them bothered me. All the mistakes and all the dopey things and all the times I was embarrassed. They don't matter. Find your passion and in my experience, no matter what you do at work, what you do in official settings, that passion will be grounded in people. Pound, grounded in the relationships you have with people and what they think of you. When your time comes

Speaker 2:          06:50          in the teeth of these stupefying odds, which is you and buy, you know ordinariness. That's right here. Oh, one thing I can tell you every single day of my life, if I trying to find somebody else to change their life, I waited till 39 to get married because I had to wait that long. Or for happiness was more important, the Fi, and if nothing else, I hope that all of you can find that kind of passion and that kind of love in your lungs. Thank you.

Speaker 7:          07:58          A Journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, so I'm an old Chinese proverb. Most people have heard it or have come across it at some point and the meanings pretty straightforward, right? And advocates having the courage to take that step towards a goal and that's huge, and making that decision to move forward towards something you want, but it's what happens immediately following that first step that I'm interested in. What happens when the journey's be gone and it's you and your goal in all of a sudden you realize how long that road ahead really is. Now this is a turning point for a lot of people and those who can succeed or able to take their daunting, intimidating goal or journey and see it for what it really is. Just a bunch of small manageable tasks strung together. You know, when you look at why people quit, a lot of the time it's because they were overwhelmed by their goals and ambitions. Well, let's say you have this wonderful plan in your head to climb a mountain. You're thinking about that feeling of being on top, looking down with pride. Every time you think about it, your heart starts racing, so you pack your stuff, you make your way down in the base of the mountain and then you look up

Speaker 7:          09:26          different ballgame right now, the entire mountains in front of you and you realize that that's no small feat. That is when people walk away, when they aren't able to see a challenge as a sum of tiny steps. They see it as a crazy impossible task. It's like saying you want to be the next Tom Brady or coby bryant to tall mountain to climb, like trying to hit a target from a mile away. But if you can identify and map out what you need to conquer in order to become a better basketball player, a football player, and begin taking those small steps improving every day, that makes dreams real. That's what gives goals life, the ability to see your objective not as a marathon, but as a series of little 400 meters stretches, stepping stones. You know what your objective is today, tomorrow, the end of the week and the end of the year, and then completing them day by day. These little victories, that's what gives you a dream life. It's what gives you momentum. You feel good about the process and by the way, when things blow up in your face, which happens every so often on this little place we call earth, you'll have that foundation and that sense of accomplishment to stay focused because your approach is tangible and it's realistic.

Speaker 7:          10:54          This applies with everything. Losing a job, a breakup, failing a test. These things that are monumental. If you allow them to be, you know, they can turn into that unclimbable mountain or they can roll map a new path for you. And if you define what you want, you define success and begin stepping towards it one hour, one day at a time, you'll get where you want to be quicker than you thought.

Speaker 6:          11:22          What changes our whole life is action. Why don't we take action? Fear? Well, we got to do to get ourselves to do it. We got to make sure that we push ourselves through it by making a decision. The point in which change happens is that decision, every change in your life that you want will come from something simple. A decision people are, what does it take to change? Decide if I persist, if I continue to try, if I continue to trudge forward, I succeed. I will persist until I succeed. I was not delivered under this world in defeat, nor does failure course in my veins. I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd. I am a lion and I refuse to talk, to walk, to sleep with the sheet.

Speaker 4:          12:16          Don't be a follower. Be a student. Take advice but not orders. Take information. But don't let somebody you know order your life not to do what someone else says. Take what someone else says. Processing. Think about it. Ponder it makes you wonder, makes you think, then it's valuable. Then when you go take action, make sure that the actions, not what somebody told you. Make sure the action is the product of your own. What I'm exactly where I wanted to be because I realized I've got to commit my very being to this thing. I gotta I gotta read it. I got to eat it and until you get there will never be successful. Once you get there, I guarantee you the world is yours.

Speaker 2:          13:00          Stay out of the clutches of mediocrity. Can Bench yourself. Reinvent yourself. Change your tone and shave so often that they can never categorize you. Reinvigorate yourself and accept what is be self taught and reinvent your life because you mentioned it to you'll life and they choose to

Speaker 6:          13:28          belongs only to you.

Speaker 8:          13:37          Positive Vibes. What my hope is to pick tool, not everybody that comes in and out. Your life is put in place. If this is just a totally happy place, this gain the courage and to every body is put in place in your life,

Speaker 6:          14:17          not to fail.

Speaker 9:          14:20          No, I never want to be that nine to five person that just lives my entire life working a nine to five and just be happy with a modest lifestyle. Um, you know, being secure. A lot of people, that's all they want and they just want a secure lifestyle. Um, you know, own a house, you know, and be able to retire and that makes them happy, you know? And I just believe that we should always be, always be pushing, you know, to achieve more. It's become more, you know, and sit at a job. The same job for 30 years is not something I would ever choose to do in the society. Know we,

Speaker 10:         14:52          we are tied to go to college and get a job. That's what we're taught. If you become a doctor or a lawyer, you're successful, you know. But most of the time you still have a boss, so have someone you know Tony what to do and you still have this schedule and you have to stick to, um, you know, so it's not much different than working at Mcdonald's. I mean it's just you're making more money but you're still on the same exact situation. And you know, working at Mcdonald's is not sinking or same scenario and making more money, you know, to me, you got to enjoy what you're doing and you know, to have the lifestyle and the freedom to do what you want when you want. You know, it was the most incredible thing. People don't understand it. You got to work hard at whatever you do, whether you're working for someone else or working for yourself.

Speaker 10:         15:36          And if you want to put that in, you know, you're going to end up being successful. You can't be satisfied. But that's what keeps us going. You know, when you become content then whites over the mentality is what's going to make things happen, you know, is having a mentality of never give up, keep pushing forward and trying to accomplish your goals. And hopefully that you have more goals, constantly trying to move on to bigger and better things and trying to improve ourselves in every area. You really have to believe what you're doing is working. You know, it was very important to believe you have to believe to achieve. If you're doing something, you're not hundred percent confident what you're doing, you're going to fail. You know, someone who is doing something, maybe not 100% correctly, but they truly believe in their mind that they're doing the best they can possibly do and they believe what they're doing is the best possible scenario.

Speaker 10:         16:24          I think they're going to have a lot more success than someone that is doing it 100% right but aren't positive and what they're doing. You know, the mind is the most powerful tool we have. And in order to be a winner, you have to lose. You know, you know, that's, that's, that's how you learn. You know, one day I may is telling me I better get out there and you know, start busting your ass, you know, going forward and never stopped. Don't miss a day. You know one day miss is that you can't get back. Always. Always look at the positive. You know the glass is always half full. If you think positive and you look at the positive, you know you're, you're only going to continue to get better. And it's being positive in every area is the secret. You know, it's a secret to life.

Speaker 10:         17:04          If you're negative about anything you're going to fail no matter what it is. You're not happy, you want to be better. But that's what you one in every aspect. Like you want to better yourself and every way a lot of people, you know, and it just comes around, goes around. The most important thing is fight in life and not give a shit what other people think. You know? That's the most important thing. And to have that kind of an attitude or mentality is rare. You know, people are always concerned about what other people think, no matter who they are. It really doesn't matter what other people think, you know? It really doesn't matter if you can have that kind of mentality is so much further in life. People don't like to think they like to ask. No, they don't like to fake. And they don't have enough confidence in their decisions that they make on their own. When they get advice from someone else, that gives them more confidence to believe that that's going to work.

Speaker 9:          18:13          We should always be trying, you know, to be better at every aspect in life. I mean, you know, are you a good husband? Are you a good wife? Are you a good son? You know, are you a good, you know, you know, whatever it could be. You know, there's a million things in life that we are, we, I think we should constantly be trying to be better in every area. I kind of liked to just, you know, relax, you know, enjoy life and that's kind of what I do. Um, and being able to, to not stress and do what I want to do when I want to do it. It's just a great feeling.

Speaker 11:         18:51          Whatever it takes to get you to try harder. Read Mar, set your goals and go for it. Here's the next attitude. Disease over caution.

Speaker 2:          19:04          Okay.

Speaker 11:         19:05          Some people never will have much there too cautious. Now you can also be too reckless, but you can also be too cost. Yes. This is called the timid approach to life and my caution was always the risk. Risk used to drive me right up the wall. I used to say, what if this happened? It's called the language of the poor. What if this happens? And on top of that, if this was to happen, look at the Phipps ib and I better not try.

Speaker 2:          19:43          Okay?

Speaker 11:         19:44          I could always ask myself out. Then I'll tell you what changed my whole life when I finally discovered it's all risky.

Speaker 2:          19:54          Yeah.

Speaker 11:         19:55          The minute you were born at got risky. If you think trying is risky, wait til they hand you the bill for not trying. If you think investing is risky, wait till you get the tab or not investing. See, it's all risky. Getting married is risky. Having children as risky, going into business is risky. Investing your money as risky. It's all risky. I'll tell you how risky life is. You're not going to get out alive. Huh? That's risky. They Englishman says, well, if that's the way it's going to work out, let's give it a go. Right? That's what it's for. Give it a go. Somebody says, yeah, but I'm looking for safety and security. Find then huddle in a corner, little cover you with a sheet. Bring it three meals a day and we'll protect you. Feed you. Look after you care for you. We won't let anything happen to you and you'll probably live to be 100 the guy said, well, yeah, I'd live to be 100 but what a way to live, right? What a way to live safe and secure dog. Ask for security. Ask for adventure. Better to live 30 years full of adventure than a hundred years safe in the corner

Speaker 11:         21:16          and see it's not important how long you live. What's important is how you live. Here's the next attitude. Disease. We're almost through with this motley list. In fact, we're almost through. Hang on. The next one is pessimism.

Speaker 2:          21:34          Okay?

Speaker 11:         21:38          Pessimism, the deadly disease of always looking on the bad side, the problem side, the difficult side, checking all the reasons why it can't be done. The poor pessimists leads an ugly life. He doesn't try to figure out what's right. He tries to figure out what's wrong. He doesn't look for virtue. He looks for faults and when he finds him, he's delighted how ugly this is. The poor guy looks through the window, doesn't see the sunset. He sees the specs on the window and this is the poor guy, right? Who rushes up, takes us to leave of your senses. This guy rushes up and he says, I've got five good reasons why it won't work. He's so dumb. He doesn't know. All you need is one. He's got five to the pessimists. The glass is always half m d to the optimist. The glass is half full. Why would the same measure affect people? Two different ways. Answer. It all depends on how you look at it. Our lives are mostly affected by the way we think. Things are not the way they are. The way we think they are affects us know.

Speaker 2:          23:00          Yeah.

Speaker 11:         23:02          There's a subject we don't have time to get into tonight called better thinking habits. One of the major things shoaff taught me when I met him. He said, poor thinking habits keeps most people poor, not poor working habits. Most people work hard, but they don't think hard. And shoaff taught me that the mind is like a factory, a mental factory, and whatever you think about all day long pours ingredients into this mental factory, and that's what bill's, the economic, social, financial fabric of your life. He quoted me a Bible phrase that says as you think so you become how awesome.

Speaker 11:         23:50          When he talked about poor thinking habits, he had me, I used to start the day reading the morning newspaper. I mean, you can leave that or not. I'd get a cup of coffee and read the paper. I load up on wars and riots and murders and stabbings and killings and bank robberies or muggings and car wrecks and tragedies. I'd even read the back pages. I seem to like that stuff for some weird reason. I'd load up on all that and then I start the day. You can imagine the kind of days I used to have you walk around on your financial needs. They call you economic peewee.

Speaker 2:          24:27          Good.

Speaker 11:         24:28          The guy says, I want to be a great leader. Wonderful. The first thing we do is follow him to his house. When we get there, we walk in and check his library.

Speaker 2:          24:42          Number one,

Speaker 11:         24:45          somebody says, well, why check his library? The reason is because what a man reads pours massive ingredients in to his mental factory and the fabric of his life is built from those ingredients.

Speaker 11:         25:03          You would not believe what some people have got in their house to read. You would not believe one of the best dressed up boards. I know for a lot of it is trash. Can you imagine dumping a bale of trash into this mental factory every day and coming out with a rich dynamic, positive life? It can be done. You might as well try making a cake with cement. The kids back in Danbury, Connecticut High School, they're asking me questions. One day I'm talking to the kids. Kids got good questions these days. One of them said to me, Mr Rohan, how do you build the good life? I said, it's simple. It's not easy, but it's simple. Here's how you build anything. Select the right ingredients, keep out the wrong ingredients, and it starts with thought. Everything starts with thought, so you must be wise and careful what you think about because that starts everything.

Speaker 2:          26:12          Okay?

Speaker 11:         26:14          You gotta be wise and careful. I asked the kids what would happen if somebody drops sugar in my coffee? They said, well, you'd be okay. I said, what if somebody dropped strychnine in my coffee? They said, well, you'd be dead. I said, correct. Less than one life is both sugar and strict nine you got a big care full. I said, what is my worst enemy? Drops in the sugar. They said, well, you'll be okay. I said, what if my best friend, even by accident drops in the strychnine? They said, well, you'd be dead. I said, correct lesson to watch your cough. You gotta be careful. See, it doesn't matter who hands you the bad stuff. It doesn't matter where you get the bad stuff. It'll still do its damage on your bank account wherever you get it. Mr Shelf gave me one of the greatest phrases when I first met him when he said, gym every day. Stand guard at the door of your mind. How important. Stand guard at the door of your mind and you decide what goes into your mental factory. Don't let anybody just dump anything they want to in your mental factory cause you've got to live with the results.

Speaker 11:         27:52          Okay, here's the last disease and we're through with this list. In fact, we're almost through. Hang on. The last subject is very brief, the last disease, but this one is deadly. Engage in this. When indulgent it even slightly and you might as well forget the future because it's going to forget you complaining, crying, whining, griping, a Bible word called murmuring. See, that'll ace your future. Spend five minutes complaining and you have wasted five and you may have begun what's known as economic cancer of the bone. Surely they will soon haul you off into a financial desert and there let you choke on the dust of your own regret. I hope I said that well so you won't forget. It's a deadly disease.

Speaker 11:         28:46          If you don't think it's bad, ask the children of Israel of Old Testament fame. Typical of us all their story just happened to get in the book. Story says, children of Israel were slaves. God performed a series of dazzling miracles and got him out, and now they're heading for the promised land. Remember, the story hadn't for the promise land tragedy of the story. They never got their reason from day one. They started to complain. They griped about the water. They griped about the weather. They whined and cried and griped about the food they griped about the leadership. They whined and cried because it was too far, too cold, too hot, too difficult, too miserable. I mean, they widened, whined and cried for years. Finally, God said, I've added tip canceled or something like that. The story says they died in the desert, never got to the promised land.

Speaker 2:          29:59          Okay?

Speaker 11:         30:00          Which I think means two things. Indulge in this long enough. You get your future cancer, and I guess it also means even God himself can only take so much,

Speaker 2:          30:16          okay?

Speaker 11:         30:19          Just be on the lookout of the things that can destroy all the good you start the war is on.

Speaker 2:          30:24          Yeah,

Speaker 11:         30:24          and this evening. Tomorrow, mentally, personally, socially, economically. You got to make sure you're winning the war.
