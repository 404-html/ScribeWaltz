Speaker 1:          00:10          He is the journey of the mind. This is what determines the journey of life. Have you ever had the feeling that your mind is on a journey of voyage, of discovery, that sometimes it has to make long passages on dark, uncharted seas and at other times and discovers bright islands of beauty or of truth I haven't zipped. We'll know from this day forward then it can always steer for him. Find in a storm while they gales of life, blow themselves out of me. Enormous sees of misfortune or pain or sorrow or doubt subside in the calm. Well, if you will come, I'd like to take you with me on such a voyage of the mind. That one that was charted for me many years ago by an obscure English editor and poet named James Allen and a little book called as a man Thinketh, that word you will hear essentially those of James Allen's as a man thinketh, thought in character.

Speaker 1:          01:09          The aphorism as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he not only embraces the whole of a man's being, but it's so comprehensive as to reach out to every condition and circumstance of his life. A man is literally what he thinks. His character being the complete sum of all his thoughts as the plant springs from and could not be without the seed. So the acts of the man's spring from the hidden seeds of thought and could not have appeared without them. The suppliers to those acts called the spontaneous and unpremeditated as well as to those which are deliberately executed. Act is the blossom of thought and joy and suffering are its fruits. That's doesn't matter. Garner in the sweet and bitter footage of his own husbandry thought in the mind have made us what we are by thought was rock and built. If a man is mine have evil thoughts, pain comes on him as comes.

Speaker 1:          02:13          That we only ox behind that if man and deere is in purity of thought, joy follows him as his own shadow. Sure man grows by law, not by artifice and cause an effect on us. Absolute and I'm deviating and they hidden realm of thought as in the world of visible and material things. A noble character is not a thing of favor or chance, but it's the natural result of continued effort and thought the effect of long cherished association with high ideals and ignoble and best Joel character, but the same process as the result of the continued, the heartbreak of grumbling thoughts man is made or unmade by in the armory of thought. He forges the weapons by which he destroys himself. He also patients the tools with which he builds for himself. Heavenly mentions of joy and strength and peace made the right choice and true application of thought man, a to our divine perfection by the abuse and wrong application of thought.

Speaker 1:          03:22          He descends below the level of the beast between these two extremes are all the grades of character and men is their maker and master of all the beautiful truth pertaining to this, so all of which have been restored and brought to light. None as mark broadening our food full of divine promise and confidence than this. That man is the master of thought. The motor of character and the maker and shaper of condition and environment and destiny as a being a power, intelligence and love and the Lord of his own thoughts. Man holds the key to every situation and contains where they himself, that transforming and regenerative agency by which he may make himself what he wills. Then as always the master, even in his weakest and most abandoned state but in weakness and degradation is not foolish. Master who miss governs his household. When he begins to reflect upon his condition and to search diligently for the law upon which is being as established, he then becomes the wise master directing his images with intelligence and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful issues such as the conscious master and then can only does become by discovering within himself the laws of thought, which discovery is totally a matter of application, self analysis and experience only by much searching and mining are golden diamonds have tamed and man confined every truth connected with his being.

Speaker 1:          05:00          If he will dig deep into the mind of his soul and that he is the maker of his character, the molder of his life. And the builder of his destiny. He may unerringly Bruv if he will watch control and ultra his thoughts tracing their effects upon himself Abramovich and upon his life and circumstances, linking cause and effect by patient practice and investigation and utilizing his every experience even to the most trivial, everyday occurrence as a means of obtaining that knowledge of himself, which is understanding wisdom. Power in this direction as in no other is the law. Absolute that P that secret findeth and to him that knocks it shall be opened our only by patients practice and the ceaseless importuning can a man enter the door of the temple of knowledge of the mind. It obeys the orders of the mind, whether they be deliberate or automatic at the bidding of evil, miserable thoughts.

Speaker 1:          06:09          Their body may sink rapidly in the disease and decay at the command of glad and beautiful thoughts. It make clothe itself with the youthfulness and beauty disease and health like circumstances are often rooted in thought. Six thoughts may express themselves through a sick body. In Aboriginal Society. It starts a fair, the known to kill a man as speedily as a bullet and they are continually killing thousands of people in our society. Justice surely though less rapidly, people who live in fear of disease are apt to become out anxiety quickly. The modernizers, the whole body and lazy it open to illness and disease while evil thoughts, even though they be no more than that, we'll soon shatter the nervous system. Strong, pure and happy thoughts build bigger and grace. The body is that sensitive plastic instrument which responds readily did that thoughts by which of his government and having some thoughts.

Speaker 1:          07:07          We'll produce that on effects, good or bad. Apartment out of a clean mind comes a clean life and a clean body. Out of a defiled mind proceeds a defined life and a corrupt body thought is the fount of action, life and manifestation. Make the founder of the pier and the stream of life of flow with greater purity, change of diet. Maybe it'll help. Amanda will not change your thoughts when a man makes his thoughts healthy. He no longer designers. I'm healthy. Food, clean thoughts make clean, healthy habits. The so called saint who doesn't have to wash his body, he may well not be a saint. And if you would perfect your body, God, your mind, if you would renew your body, beautify your mind. Thoughts of malice in the disappointment, despondency can rob your body of it's health and grace. A sour face does not come by chance.

Speaker 1:          08:07          It has made my salad thoughts, wrinkles that mar are drawn by folly, pride and passion. I know a woman of 96 who has the bright innocent face of a girl. I know a man well under the middle age whose faces drawn into inharmonious kind of two areas. The one is the result of us, so even a sunny disposition. The others, the outcome of bad temper and discontent as you cannot have a suite and wholesome abode unless you admit the air and sunshine freely in the or rooms. So a strong body and a bright, happy, serene condiments can only result from my free admittance into the mind of thought, some joy and goodwill and serenity on the faces of the age. There are wrinkles made by sympathy. There's by strong impure thought and others are carved by arrogance and resentment who cannot distinguish them, what those have lived thoughtfully.

Speaker 1:          09:03          Agent's calm, peaceful and softly mellow like the setting sun. I have recently seen a philosopher on his death bed. He was not a old except in years he died. The sweeper, he and peacefully as he's lived, there is no physician like cheerful thought for dissipating the ills of malcontent. There is a comparator to compare with goodwill, for dispersing the shadows of grief and Sarah to have continually in thoughts of ill will, cynicism, suspicion and mv is to be confined in a self made me prison hall, but to think well of all to be cheerful with all just patiently learned to find the good in all is to live in sight of the very portals of heaven and they buy the thoughts of peace start. Every creature will bring a bounding piece to that possessor thought and circumstances, a man's mind and maybe likened it to a garden which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild, but when it comes invaded or neglected, it must end, will bring forth.

Speaker 1:          10:09          If no useful seeds I put into it, then an abundance of useless weed seeds will fall there and we'll continue to produce that kind of justice at. Gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires. So many young men tend the garden of his mind. We had all the wrong and useless thoughts and cultivating toward perfection, the flowers and fruits to ripe, useful and pure thoughts. My pursuing this process, a man sooner or later discovers that he is the master gardener of his soul, the director of his life. He also reveals within himself the laws of thought and understands with ever increasing accuracy how his mind operates in the sheep. We have his character, circumstances and destiny. Thought and character are one and as character can only manifest and discovered itself to environment and circumstance, the outer conditions of a person's life will always be found to be related to his inner state.

Speaker 1:          11:15          This does not mean that a man of circumstances at any given time or an indication of his entire character, but that those circumstances are so intimately connected with some vital thought within himself that for the time being they are indispensable to his development. Every man is where he is by the law of his being. The thoughts which he has built into his character have brought him there and in the arrangement of his life there is no lasting element of champs, but all is the result of a law which cannot bear. This is just as true of those who are discontented with their surroundings as of those who are contented with them. As an evolving being man is where he is, that he may learn that he may grow and as he learns the lesson which any circumstance contains for him, it passes away and give spice to other circumstances.

Speaker 1:          12:10          Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to be a creature and currently subject to outside conditions. But when he realizes that he is a creative power and that he made command the hidden soil and seeds of his being, how to avoid circumstances grow, he then becomes the right full master of himself that circumstances grow out of thought. Every man knows who has for any length of time, practice, self control of his mind and thoughts for he will live. Notice that the alteration of his circumstances has been an exact ratio with is altered mental condition. So true is this, that when a man earnestly applies himself to remedy the defects in his character and make swift and mark the progress, he passes rapidly through a succession of this institutes that so attracts lack, which is secretly hybrids, that which it loves, and also that which it fears.

Speaker 1:          13:06          It reaches the height of his cherished aspirations. It falls to the level of its unchaste desires and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own and we thought seeds sown are allowed to fall into the mind and to take root there producers a tone blossoming sooner or later in the act and bearing its own food, age of opportunity in circumstance, good thoughts, bear good fruit, bad thoughts, bad trip. The outer world of circumstances shaped by the inner world of thought and both pleasant and unpleasant external conditions or factors which make for the ultimate good of the individual. As the reaper of his own harvest man learns both by suffering and bliss following me in most desires, aspirations, thoughts by which he allows himself to be dominated, pursuing me will the West sort of vapor, the imaginings are steadfast. We walking the highway of strong and high end ever a man at last arrives at their fruition and fulfillment in the outer conditions of his life.

Speaker 1:          14:14          The laws of growth and adjustment everywhere. Obtain a man does not come to the arms house, so the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of grovelling thoughts and base desires, nor does a high minded men fall. Suddenly the crime by stress am a mere external force. The criminal thoughts have long been secretly fostered in the heart when the hour of opportunity you'd be able to, it's gathered power circumstance does not make the man. It reveals no such conditions can exist as defending and device and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations or ascending into virtue and it's happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations. And then they have Laura as the Lord and Master of thought is the maker of himself, the shaper and author of environment. The soul comes to its own. Through every step of the jeffery pilgrimage.

Speaker 1:          15:18          It attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which are the reflections of its own virtue and vice. It's strength and weakness. Men did not attract that which they say they want, but that could stay are their whims fancies and ambitions are taught it. At every step, but they're in most parts and desires are fed with the food of their own choosing the divinity, the chiefs, our ams is in ourselves. It is our very self man is manacle only by himself. Thought and action are the jailers of fate. They imprison being based that also the angels of freedom. They liberate being no book, not what he wishes him praise for it as a man get, but what he justly earns. His wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they comport with his thoughts and actions in the light of this truth. What then is the meaning of fighting against circumstances?

Speaker 1:          16:23          It means that a man has continually revolting against an effect without wet all the time. He is nourishing and preserving its cause in his heart. That caused me to take the form of a conscious vice or an unconscious weakness, but whatever it is, it's stubbornly returns the efforts of its possessor and thus calls allowed the remedy. Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves. They therefore remain bound, but names will, does not shrink from self sacrifice, can never fail to accomplish. The object upon which he was hard is that this is as true of material as of spiritual things. Even the man who was so object is to acquire wealth and must be prepared to make great personal sacrifices. We've already can accomplish this object and how much marcel he would realize a happy, joyful life. It was a man who is wretchedly poor, is extremely anxious that his surroundings and home comfort should be improved it all the time.

Speaker 1:          17:27          He shirks his work and considers these justified in trying to deceive his employer on the ground of the insufficiency of his wages. Such a man does not understand the simplest rudiments of those principles, which are the basis of true prosperity and there's not only totally unfitted derives out of his wretchedness, but it's actually attracting to himself a student deeper wretchedness by dwelling m and acting out in Dulles deceptive and a memory thought he was a rich man who was the victim of a painful and persistent ill health as a result of glutimate. He's willing to give large sums of money to get rid of it, but he will not abandon his gluttony. He wants to gratify his taste for rich and harmful volumes and have his health as well. Such a man is totally unfit to have help because he has not yet learned the first principles of a healthy life.

Speaker 1:          18:20          Here's my employer of labor who adopts crooked measures to avoid paying the regulation wage and in the hope of making larger profits. We do says the wages of his work, people such a man as altogether unfitted for prosperity and when he finds himself bankrupt both as regards reputation and bridges, he blames circumstances not knowing that he is the sole author of his condition. I've introduced these three cases nearly as illustrative of the truth. That man is the causer. They'll nearly always unconscious way of his circumstances and that while aiming at a good and he may continually frustrated it's accomplishment. My thoughts and desires, which cannot possibly harmonize with that end in such cases could be multiplied in varied almost indefinitely, but this is not necessarily as you can if he still is the action of the laws of thought in your own mind in life.

Speaker 1:          19:15          I'm telling you, do this near external facts are not likely to persuade you. Circumstances however, are so complicated. Thought is so deeply rooted in the conditions of happiness, very so with individuals that a man's entire condition, although it may be now under himself, cannot be judged by another from the external aspect of his life alone. A man may be honest in certain directions, it's separate privations and man, they be dishonest in certain directions, yet acquire wealth. The conclusion usually formed however, that the one man fails because of his particular honesty and that the other prospers because of his particular dishonesty is the result of a superficial judgment, which assumes that the dishonest man is almost totally corrupt and the honest man almost entirely virtuous in the light of a deeper knowledge and wider experience. Such judgment is found to be around this. But dishonest man, they have some admirable virtues which the other does not possess.

Speaker 1:          20:14          And the honest man, obnoxious devices which are absent in the other. The honest man rapes the good results. So designers, thoughts and acts. He also brings upon himself the sufferings, which is vice's and the dishonest man. Likewise, gun has his own sufferings and happiness and it's pleasing the human vanity to believe that one suffers because of one's virtue, but not have them tell. A man has extubated every vicious, bitter and resentful thought from his mind. Can he be in a position to know and declare that his sufferings are the result of is good and not of his

Speaker 2:          20:48          bad qualities? And on the way to yet long before it has reached that supreme perfection, he will have found working in his mind in life the great law, which is absolutely just in which cannot therefore give good for evil, evil for good, possessing such knowledge. He will then know, looking back upon this past ignorant and blindness that his life is and always was justly ordered and that all his past experiences. Good and bad, where the equitable outworking of his evolving yet unevolved good thoughts and actions can never in the long run and produce bad results, bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results. This has been saying that nothing can come from corn, but corn, nothing from metals, but metals. Men understand this law and the natural world and work with it, but few understand it and the mental and moral world though it's operation.

Speaker 2:          21:46          The hair is just as simple and I'm deviating and they therefore do not cooperate with it. Mental suffering is always the effect of error in some direction, and it's an indication that the individual is out of harmony with himself, with the law of his being the sole. I'm supreme you. So such suffering is to correct and teach mental suffering ceases or him who was wise. There can be no object burning gold after the drug has been removed and the mind of a perfectly enlightened beings cannot be agonized. The circumstances which Amanda encounters with suffering of the result of his own bleak outlook. The circumstances which amendment counters with blessedness or again the result of his own aptitude, blessedness, not material possessions is the measure of right wretchedness, not the lack of material possessions is the major of wrong. A man may be cursed and rich.

Speaker 2:          22:48          He may be blessed and poor blessedness and enriches only join together when the richards or wisely used and the poor man old me descends into wretchedness when he regards his life as a Britain unjustly imposed in the gym. Some indulgence are the two extremes of wretchedness. They're both equally unnatural. A man is not rightly conditioned until he's a happy, healthy, and prosperous being. And happiness. Health and prosperity are the results of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer of the man, with his surroundings. A man only begins to be a man when he sees us, don't whine and revile and commenced this to search where they hidden justice, which regulates his life. And as he adapts his mind too, that regulating factor, he ceases to accuse others as the cause of his condition. And built himself up in strong and noble. Thoughts ceases to kick against circumstances, but begins to use them as aids to his more rapid progress and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and possibilities within himself.

Speaker 2:          24:01          Law Not confusion is that dominating principle in the universe. Justice, not injustice is the sum and substance of life and righteousness, not corruption is the molding and moving forest in the spiritual government of the world. This being so Manhattan, but to write himself to find that the university's right and during the process of putting himself right, he will find that as he alters his thoughts towards situations and other people situations and other people will alter your toward him. The proof of this truth is in every person and that therefore admits them. Easy investigation by systematic introspection and self analysis and a man radically alter his thoughts and he will be astonished that the rapid transformation that will affect in the material conditions of his life. Imagine that thought can be kept secret, but it cannot. It rapidly crystallizes into habit and habits solidifies in just circumstance.

Speaker 2:          25:05          Thoughts of fear, doubt and indecision crystallize into week unmanly and irresolute habits, which solidify in the circumstances of failure. Indigents and slavish dependence, lazy, apathetic, thought's crystallizing the habits of disorder. I'm climbing there some dishonesty we solidify in the circumstances of confusion, fallenness and beggary resentful and we condemn monetary thought's, crystallizing the habits of accusation and violence, which solidify in the circumstances of hate, injury and persecution. On the other hand, beautiful thoughts of all kinds of crystallize and the habits and grace and timeliness which to defined a genial and sunny circumstances. Selfless thought's crystallizing the habits of temporary, some self control which solidify in the circumstances of risk, pros and peace, thoughts of courage, self reliance and decision crystallized into manly habits which solidify under circumstances of strength and freedom and energetic thought's crystallizing the habits of industry, which sort of divide and the circumstances of achievement kind and loving thoughts, crystallizing the habits of considerateness for others which solidify and the circumstances of a biting comfort.

Speaker 2:          26:27          A particular train of thought persisted and be it good or bad, cannot fail to produce it through south. So character in sexual stances and man, can I directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts and so indirectly yet surely shape their circumstances. Make your health every man to the gratification of the thoughts which he most encourages and opportunities are presented, which were most speedily bring to the service, both the good and evil thoughts. Imam choose his thoughts wisely and all the world will soften toward him and be ready to help him. Let him put away bad thoughts and low opportunities or spring up on every hand. The aid is strong results. Nothing even encourage good thoughts and no hard fate. Chub binding them down to wretchedness and shit. The world is your kaleidoscope, the varying combinations of which it every succeeding moment it presents to you as the exquisitely adjusted pictures of your ever moving thought you will be what you will to be let failure find.

Speaker 2:          27:35          It's false content in that poor word environment, but spirits scorns it and it's free. It masters time, it conquers space. It cows that boastful texted champs and bibs the terror of circumstance. I'm the crown and fill a servant's place. The human will that force unseen. The offspring of a deathless soul can hew a way to any goal. The walls of granite intervene be not impatient in delay, but wait as one who understands when spirit rises and commands, the Gods are ready to obey thought purpose and achievement until thought is linked with purpose. There is no intelligent accomplishment with the majority. The park daughters allowed to drift upon the ocean of life. Aimlessness is advice and such. Drifting must not continue for him. I would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction. They who have no central purpose in their life, following easy prey to petty worries, fears, troubles himself could headings, all of which are indications of weakness, which lean just to Shirley is deliberate wrongdoing by a different route to failure, unhappiness and loss for weakness cannot persist in a power evolving universe.

Speaker 2:          29:01          A man should conceive of a worthy purpose in his heart and set up to accomplish it. You should make this purpose the centralizing point of his thoughts. It may take the form of a spiritual ideal or it may be a worldly object according to his nature at the time, but whichever it is, he should have steadfastly focused his thoughts upon the object which he has set before him. He should make this purpose is supreme duty and should devote himself to its attainment, not allowing his thoughts to wander away and the vague and if female offenses, this is the royal road to self control and true concentration of thought. Even if he fails again, again to accomplish his purpose as he necessarily master drove weaknesses, overcome the spring third character he dreams will be the measure of its true success and this will form a new starting point for future power and tramp.

Speaker 2:          29:55          Those who are not prepared to conceive and dedicate themselves to a great purpose should fix that. Thoughts upon the fault was performance of their beauty. No matter how significant bed tasks may appear, only in his wake and the thoughts began there and focused and resolution that energy be developed, which being done there is nothing that may not be accomplished. The weakest will knowing its own weakness and believing this truth, that strength can only be developed by effort in practice, will thus believing at once begin to exert itself and add the effort, effort patients to patients from strength to strength will never cease to develop and will it last grow strong as the physically weak man can make himself strong by careful impatient exercise. So the man and we thought it can become strong by training himself in thinking to put away aimlessness and weakness and to begin this think with purpose is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only recognize failure as one of the pathway is to attain them who make all conditions, serve them and do things strongly attempt fearlessly and accomplish masterfully.

Speaker 2:          31:10          Having conceived of his purpose, a man should prudently mark out a straight pathway to its achievement. Looking neither to the right nor the left doubts and fears should be rigorously excluded. They are disintegrating elements which break up the straight line of effort, rendering it crooked, ineffectual, useless thoughts of doubt and fear never accomplished anything and never cam. They always lead to failure, purpose them energy or weakened when doubt and fear creeping up the will to do springs to my knowledge that we can do doubt and fear of the great enemies of this knowledge and he would encourage them forts himself at every step. He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure is every thought is fraught with power, is difficulties wisely. Bravely met an overcoat is purposes or seasonably planted and the boom and bring forth fruit which does not fall prematurely to the ground thought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force.

Speaker 2:          32:19          He who knows this is ready to become something higher and stronger than a mere bundle of wavering thoughts and fluctuating sensations. He who does this has become the conscious and intelligent wielder of his mental powers over the amount of cheese at all he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts and adjust the ordered universe where loss of repose means destruction. Individual responsibility must be absolute a man's weakness and strength, wisdom and follow his own right and not another man. They have a product of himself and not another, and they can only be ordered by himself, never buy another is circumstances also on his own and not another man. His suffering and his happiness, we evolved from within as he thinks so is he. As he continues to think so, he remains strong. Man cannot help a weaker unless the weaker is willing to be helped and even then that week, man must become strong of himself.

Speaker 2:          33:33          He must by his own efforts develop the strength which he admires and another none but himself can alter his condition. It has been unusual for Amanda thinking to say many men are slaves because one is an oppressor. Let us hate the oppressor. However, there is a Mayan increasing few, a tendency to reverse this judgment and to say one man is an oppressor because many are slaves that has despised the slaves. The truth is that a presser and Suede, our cooperators and ignorance and the Yoc, I mean to reflect each other in reality of the funeral was out. It. Perfect knowledge precedes the action of law and the weakness of the oppressed and the misapplied power of the oppressor. A perfect love seeing the suffering which both states and tail condemns neither a perfect compassion and basis. Both oppressor and oppressed eus conquered weakness and has put away selfish thoughts, belongs neither to oppress her nor oppressed.

Speaker 2:          34:39          He has free. A man can only rise, conquer, and achieve. By lifting up his thoughts, he can only remain weak and object and miserable by refusing to lift up his thoughts before Amanda can achieve anything, even in the world if things he must lift his thoughts above the animal level, he may not in order to succeed, give up all an amount of ego. Selfish does by any means, but a portion of it at least must be sacrificed. A man who was Chris' daughter, self indulgence can either think clearly and our plan methodically, he cannot find them. Developers, Lakeland grease sources, and I must fail in any undertaking I've having commenced from men from eight to control his thoughts. He's not in a position to control affairs and to adopt serious responsibilities. He's not fed to act independently in standalone. He's limited by the thoughts where she chooses.

Speaker 2:          35:38          There can be no progress, no achievement without sacrifice and a man's worldly success will be in the measure that he sacrifices his confused animal thoughts and fixes his mind on the development of this plans and the strengthening of his resolution and self reliance and the higher he lifts his thoughts, the more manly and upright he becomes. The greater will be his success. The more blessed than enduring will be as achievement. The universe does not favor the greedy, the dishonest the fishes. Although on the mirror surface it may sometimes appear to do so. It's continuing. A Beckman is what the honesty, the magnanimous, the virtuous, all the great teachers, the ages have declared this and varying forms and approve and know it. A man has been to persist and lifting up his thoughts. Intellectual achievements are the results of thought consecrated to the search for knowledge or for the beautiful and true in life and nature.

Speaker 2:          36:36          Such achievements maybe sometimes connected with vanity and ambition, but they're not the outcome of those characteristics. They have a natural outgrowth of long and arduous effort and arduous searching thought. Spiritual achievement is the consummation of aspiration. He who lives constantly and the conception of wise and noble thoughts or dwellings dwells upon all that is elevating and himself as well. As surely as this time reaches it's Dean and the moon, it's will become knowledgeable and noble and rise into a position of wisdom and blessedness, achievement of whatever kind is the crown of effort, the diadem of thought by self control, resolution at auditions and well directed thought a man sm by an amount of the endurance, corruption and confusion of God. Amen. Amen. May Rise to highest success in the world. Andrew luck the altitudes in the spiritual realm and again descend into weakness and wretchedness by allowing arrogant, selfish, and corrupt thoughts to take possession of it.

Speaker 2:          37:45          The victory is attained by thought can only be maintained by watchfulness many giveaway when success is assured and rapidly fall back into failure. Achievement, whether an a business, intellectual or spiritual world is the result of definitely directed thought is governed by the same law and dependent upon the same method. The only difference lies in the object of a payment. He who had accomplished little needs sacrifice level II who would achieve much with sacrifice much. He who would attain highly resacrifice greatly vision and ideals, the visionaries of the saviors of the world as the visible world is sustained by the end of visible. So men who all their trials and fins and sordid vocations are nourished by the beautiful vision was of their sanitary dreamers. Humanity cannot forget it's dreamers. It can not let their ideas fade and die. It lives in the moment it feels in them.

Speaker 2:          41:03          You cannot travel with them and stand still without. It was a youth hard pressed by poverty and labor confined long hours in an unhealthy workshop unschooled and lacking all the arts, but he brings a better things. He thinks of intelligence, of refinements, of grace and beauty. He conceives of mentally builds up an ideal life. The vision of a wider liberty and a larger scope takes possession of it. Unrest, urges him to action and he utilizes all his time and means small, low. They are to the development of his latent powers and resources very soon so altered. It has his mind become that the workshop can no longer hold him. It has become so out of harmony with his mentality that it falls out of his life as a garment is cast aside and with the growth of opportunities which fit the scope of his expanding in better the a passes out of it forever.

Speaker 2:          42:03          Years later we see this youth as a full grown man.

He speaks and low lives are changed. Men and women hang up on his words and we mold their characters and the sunlight. It becomes the fixed and Illumina cetera around which innumerable destiny's revolves. He has realized that vision of his youth, he has become one with his idea and you too will realize the vision, not the idols of your heart be its base or beautiful or a mixture of both for your will always gravitate toward that what you secretly, most love NPR hands will be placed the exact results of your own thoughts.

How few people we meet in my life who are well balanced, who have the exquisite poise, which is characteristic of the finished press. Yes. Humanity. Sturges with uncontrolled emotion is to Mulch us with ungoverned. Grief is blown about by anxiety and about only the wise man.
