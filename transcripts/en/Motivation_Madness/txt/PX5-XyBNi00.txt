Speaker 1:          00:00:09       Seventy years ago I was in high school, almost a third as long as the country has been around and when I was in high school, I really only had two things on my mind, girls and cars and and it wasn't doing very well with girls, so we'll talk about cars, but let's just imagine that when we finished, I'm going to let each one of you pick out the car of your choice. Sounds good, doesn't it? Pick it out. Any color, you name it, it will be tied up with a bow and it will be at your house tomorrow and you say, well, what's the catch? And the catch is that it's the only car you're going to get in your lifetime. Now what are you going to do knowing that that's the only car you're ever going to have it and you love that car? You're going to take care of it by you cannot believe.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       Now, what I'd like to suggest, you're not going to get only one car in your lifetime, but you only get one body and one mind and that's all you're going to get and that body and mind feels terrific now, but it has to last you a lifetime. Most important thing is to decide what is to be able to define which ones you can come to an intelligent decision on and which ones are beyond your capacity to evaluate. You don't have to be right about thousands and thousands and thousands of companies. You only have to be right about a company. A couple. I met Bill Gates on July fifth, 19, 91. We were out in Seattle and bill said, you've got to have a computer. And I said, why? And he said, well, he said you can do your income tax on it. It said, I don't have any income. Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend. And he said, well, you can keep track of your portfolio. And I said, I only have one stock. I said, I.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       He says, it's going to change everything. And I said, well, will it change whether people chew gum? And he said, well, probably not. And I said, well, we'll change what kind of gum they show. And I said, well then I'll stick of chewing gum and Houston computers. You don't have to understand all kinds of all kinds of businesses I don't understand, but there's thousands of opportunities there. I did understand the Bank of America, you know, and uh, and I'll be able to, I'm able to do that. I'm able to understand some given percentage. But Ted Williams wrote a book called the science of hitting and in science of hitting, he's got a diagram, shows him at the plate and he's got the strike zone divided into 77 squares each the size of a baseball. And he says, if I only swing at pitches in the sweet zone, which he shows there and he has what his batting average would be, which is 400.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       If he had to swing it low outside pitches. But still in the, in the strike zone is average, would be 2:30. He said the most important thing and hitting is waiting for the right pitch. Now he was at a disadvantage because of the account was all in two or one and two or so on. Even if that ball was down where he was only going about 2:30, he had to swing at it. In investing, there's no called strikes. People Control Microsoft. That man, you know your name and any, any stock, General Motors, uh, and I don't have to swing at nobody's gonna call me out on called strikes. I only get a strike called if I swing at a pitch and mess. So I can wait there and look at thousands of companies day after day and only when I see something I understand and what I liked the price at which is selling.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       Then if I swing, if I, if I headed fine, if I miss it, it's, it's, it's a strike. But it's an enormously advantageous game and it's a terrible mistake. The thing, you have to have an opinion on everything. You only have to have an opinion on a few things. In fact, I've told students if when they got out of school, they got a punch card with 20 punches on it and that's all the investment decisions they got to make in their entire life. They would get very rich because they would think very hard about each one. And you don't need 20 right decisions to get very rich, you know, four or five, we'll probably do it over time. So, uh, I don't worry too much about the things. I don't understand it. If you understand some of these businesses that are coming along and can spot things on, if you can spot on Amazon, for example, I mean, it's a tremendous accomplishment what Jeff Bezos has done, and I tip my hat to him.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       He's a wonderful businessman. He's a good guy too, but can I have anticipated that he would be the success and 10 others wouldn't be. I'm not good enough to do that, but I don't. Unfortunately, I don't have to. You know, that I don't have to form an opinion on, on Amazon. And I do. I did form an opinion on the Bank of America and I formed an opinion on Coca Cola. Coca Cola has been around since 18, 86. There's one point 8 billion, one point 8 billion, eight ounce servings of Coca Cola products sold every day. Now if you take one penny and get one penny extra, that's $18, million dollars a day and 18 million times 365 is 7 billion. Seven hundred 30 billion or 6 billion, $570,000,000. So annually, 6 million. Five hundred $70,000,000 from one penny. Do you think coca cola is worth a penny more than you know Joe's Cola? I think so. So you know, and I've got about 127 years of history would indicate it. So those are the kinds of decisions I like to make and you may have an entirely different field of expertise than I would have probably much more up to date in terms of the kind of businesses that seeing above. And

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       you can get very rich if you just understand the few of them and understand their future. What is it that you two share? What makes this friendship so satisfying for both of you? Well, I think we both certainly share a curiosity about the world and we come from two different but related worlds. Uh, so we had probably spent about 10 hours of this one hour visit that was scheduled on July fifth, 1991. His mother had to talk him into it and uh, we weren't halfway. I mean, we haven't gotten no place in terms of our eventual agenda just in that time. In fact, the governor of Washington came by and bills that had to come into the bedroom. Polar bears we were talking about, well, we have fun to start with. Every relationship should have a lot of fun and it, and, and we've, we, we find the world and just such an interesting place.

Speaker 2:          00:06:53       So we like to compare notes on it when we compare notes. We have a lot of fun doing it. Part of the time is, I remember the conversation, and by the way, there's a remarkable documentary about wiring, which is on Hbo. Uh, I think it premieres on Gandy 30th Monday. You should take time to take a look at it, builds involved in that and you will see in a sense, it's called, I think becoming Warren Buffett. Yeah, that's what it's called because it took me six years, but think you're doing well on it so far. Best is yet to come. One of the things that happened tonight, Bill, was it, I Guess Your Dad, uh, at the dinner said, you know, what is it, what's been the most important quality for you and you found out that you and Warren had the same word. Yeah, I think curiosity, which Warren mentioned is a,

Speaker 3:          00:07:47       an amazing thing where you try and predict what's going to happen and then a, when it doesn't sort of think, well, uh, you know, that a drug didn't get invented that stock to go up. That approach wasn't popular once. What is it about my model of the world that's wrong, you know, who could I talk to, what could I read? And, and the things that have happened since 1991. Uh, mostly good things have been amazing and just so much fun to talk about. A

Speaker 2:          00:08:21       No. So we read the news and we think, God, what did Warren think about that? You both are readers. You both, you read all the time, all day, Lauren built. Oh, you're a reader. You also do a lot of sort of courses online as well. What does that have done? What has that done for your life? The sense of constantly learning. Well, go ahead bill.

Speaker 3:          00:08:43       It's an incredible time to be a learner. I remember when I was young and I had the world book, which is one of Warren's products and it was very good, but I always felt like kind of how want to get into this in more depth. I understand it better today, the videos that are online and the courses that you combined with the very best professors. It's phenomenal, you know, take a subject like weather or climate change or what's going on in economics, what's known, what's not known now with the foundation. A lot of what I need to learn this about biology, making vaccines and uh, what's going on with these, these various diseases. This is a phenomenal time to be a curious person. The information that's out there, you know, I have a, my, my biggest problem is that I stay up too late because I'm reading and then I'm a little bit tired the next day. Uh, the other thing that you share other than reading his optimism, you believe in America. Absolutely. You have said to me more than once. Uh, I would give up a year of my life just to know what the next 50 is going to be like.

Speaker 4:          00:09:52       Yeah. Even for now. Why'd you pick for number that came to me is just fascinating what's happened just in my lifetime, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       in the six years. I shouldn't mention one thing about reading a, it was at the library here at Columbia. I wish I spent probably more time than any other student I, I lived there practically. But I pulled the book out there, happened to be who's doing an American that taught me something about my professor Benjamin Graham. And then I looked up and I went to the library and I said, I want to look more, learn more about this because I learned this over here. That changed my whole life. You know, we own Geico now because of a librarian directing me to some other book and then following through on that. It's the chance I, I read about one fifth, the pace the bill does, but I still spend five or six hours a day reading. I mean, it just, you can learn so much. I particularly love biography just to, you know, to be able to live the lives of. These people have been so extraordinary. The lessons and the, you know, the discouragements they face just everything about it. So I, it can't get enough of reading at. What surprises you most about bill? Uh, that's an interesting question. I guess what really surprised me initially, we just found so many things to connect on that uh, uh, he didn't try to sell me a computer.

Speaker 4:          00:11:26       Uh, that's probably the only sale he didn't make all the computer changed my life

Speaker 2:          00:11:33       for the better in a big way subsequently. But uh, well he, he, he just had the same curiosity that, and the other word, you have used his focus when the focus is no question if, I mean he, both of us got to where we are in a big, big way because of focusing. Bill. What surprises you about Warren? I was so

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       amazed that he comes to investing with this broad model of the world. So one of the first questions he asked me was a, Microsoft's a small company. Ibm's this huge company. Why can you do better? Why can't they beat you at the software game that you're playing? And I always, you know, you know, every day I was thinking about, okay, what advantage do we have? What we do. But nobody ever asked me that question and we've talked about the economics of software, which is a very, a different and special thing. And he could relate it to things that he'd seen and you know, I didn't understand banking why some get ahead and some don't. And so he was able to put that in very clear terms. And so I found somebody whose model was rich enough that it helped me understand things that I really wanted to know and we could laugh about things that were a surprise to us.

Speaker 3:          00:12:48       I'd say his humility and his sense of humor really stood out in this incredible way. I mean he enjoys what he does and he shares that with other people. And even, you know, when I ask questions that are pretty naive that he's probably been asked 15 times, he's very nice about it took me a long time to figure this out, Bill. But here's how it works. I tried bill out with some non transmitted dies and I'd read about them in scientific American or someplace and there are only two people in the world and the history of these dice that actually figured it out while I was trying to take their money from them. And one was the leading symbolic logic in the world. And the other was a drunk who didn't really know any better. Ask the wrong question. But bill said, wait a second.

Speaker 3:          00:13:32       You choose first and the game was over you. You taught him not. You didn't teach him, but you brought him into a great appreciation of bridge. Yeah, he can play bridge, but the family is very big on games as family with very, very big on games and, and uh, and so we, we, we, we played bridge together and we played in China going down rivers. You're supposed to be looking at. We had a good time point. Alright, we've got a lot of questions. We want to talk to him, the audience. Somebody we want to start up in a, up in the balcony. So we'll, we. So you know, we haven't forgotten you. It's hard to see. But is there a number there that has a question?

Speaker 4:          00:14:10       Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:14:11       okay. Start it. Wherever it is. Yes. Number six.

Speaker 3:          00:14:19       I thank both of you guys for being here today. My question is in regards to public health and vaccinations. Given our current president's publicly stated stance against the use of vaccinations both in this country and abroad, how would you recommend that we as students and future leaders in health sciences best to allocate our resources to most effectively resist his alternative fact political philosophy in regards to the domestic and global public health? Thank you. That's a good place to start. Well, the facts about vaccines are very clear and very strong, which is both a that they're safe and that the vaccine schedule has been designed to reduce disease and you know, the more parents that adhere to it, the more not only their children be protected, but you have some kids who are immune deficient and so unless the kids around them are protected, then it puts those kids at risk and there are diseases like measles or purposes that all it takes is a small cluster and then mostly those diseases would be coming in from overseas, but you can get infection and in some European countries you've had dads because the kids weren't vaccinated.

Speaker 3:          00:15:35       I don't think the US government is going to come out with any negative statements. There may be a commission, and fortunately if she look at the facts, the facts are quite unequivocal. Uh, we certainly are speaking out in favor of vaccines. So I, I, uh, you know, I'm a little surprised that we have to stick up for them, but it's true in every country that you get these rumors and particularly in today's media, those rumors can get out. And I had the facts because the rumors were sort of more salacious or, uh, you know, contrary to what you've been told, type things, uh, here, I'm sure we'll have a chance if necessary, to go through the facts again in and get a clear positive message from the government. And the risk is if vaccines, some have people are scared of having vaccines, the risk is, well, there were engaged right now in polio eradication.

Speaker 3:          00:16:29       And the only way that succeeds is to get 95 percent of the kids to have these vaccines. And there we found, we ran into a form of anti vaccine sentiment that's even worse than us. Rumors and that is that to terrorists groups. One in Nigeria, Boko Haram and another one in Pakistan, Afghanistan, the polar bond said that vaccination was a US plot and you know, would sterilize women and it was a very bad thing and they took the women who are going out to the children's houses in getting these oral drops, oral polio vaccine, and actually killed a number of them. And so those negative rumors, the only reason we still have polio today that were not done is because of that part of Nigeria that bulk roms caused armrest in the border areas, including Baluchistan in Pakistan where there've been these anti-vaccine sentiments. So you know, our risk is, is, is simply those negative things.

Speaker 3:          00:17:30       So it's not just in rich countries that we run into this. It absolutely is causes deaths. If parents don't know, bring your kids in and, and get them fully vaccinated and your drive to eradicate polio is to show that you can do it. Well. It'll be. It started in 1988 when it already had been eradicated in the Americas. So these were the for the US in the sixties. The rest of the Americas in the seventies showed that it could be done. And so in 1988, uh, well before our foundation was involved, a rotary and a number of other organizations said, let's get rid of this. And it's been harder than was expected just because of these sentiments, you know, here we are in 2016, [inaudible] 17 last year, less than 50 cases. So we are very, very close. In fact, there are so few cases now, the way that we track where the virus is, is we go and look at sewage samples and we see because a lot of kids, uh, get infected and pass along without getting paralyzed. And so it's only through the sewage samples. We know that they're still about four places in Pakistan and Afghanistan and one place in Nigeria that we, we haven't gotten there yet. All right. Let's see. Next question. Uh, I got to see a car number one.

Speaker 5:          00:18:50       Thank you both so much for being here. My question again, sorry, is a, a little bit on the political spectrum. I was wondering what you're both most hopeful about in this new political environment we have. And also what you're both most worried about,

Speaker 2:          00:19:02       you want to take hope are worried more than. Well, I'm, I'm, I'm confident that America will move ahead. It's been no from the time I was born until now. The real GDP per capita in this country is one of six for one. I mean, nobody ever dreamt that would be possible. And when you look at what's happened in this country over 240 years, you know, it's, it's an absolute miracle. When I went to Columbia business school, September 19, 51 woman in the class, I mean, this country moves forward and uh, you can't stop it. So I'm enormously off. I say the luckiest person born in the history of the world was the baby being born today in this country. And we will go and, you know, everybody, half the country always is going to be able to somewhat unhappy close to half about the last election.

Speaker 2:          00:19:55       But I grew up in a household, uh, in the late 1930 [inaudible]. My Dad was very republican. Yeah. My sisters and I didn't get dessert unless we said something bad about Roosevelt. I mean it was just, it was required and I heard all these apocalyptic views about after his third term, there'll be no more elections. I've been hearing that all my life and you know, year after year after year with occasional hiccups and, and an occasional seizure like we had in 2008, nine, but this country, it's all profit folks. I mean, you know, when I came in just think of what it would have been like in 17, 76, nothing here and now we've been the velocity of change and just keep moving. I mean guys like bill, you know, they don't quit, you know, I mean he, he moves on to something like polio. He mentions 50 cases in the world. There were more than 50

Speaker 6:          00:20:47       in the ward where I went when I was a teenager to see a friend of my sisters and they're all these rocking machines and everything. They were destined to a terrible, terrible life was just one ward in Omaha and now that's, you know, that's the yearly total. Thanks. Initially the as well as currently the rotary in some, but people kept working on it. This world moves forward and it's been doing. I bought my first stock when I was 11 in April of 19. Forty $2. 100. If you haven't looked at 20,000, something good must have happened and it's going to keep happening.

Speaker 3:          00:21:23       Phil, I know you share the optimism. What about concerns? Well, their optimism is partly that I think American innovation is strong support for research is by and large bipartisan and so whether it's health breakthroughs or even energy breakthroughs, I think you know, every year that goes by we're going to have more of those things. Now. This administration is new enough. We don't know how their budget priorities will come out. You know, there are things like foreign aid which is a small part of the budget, about 30 billion year, but that means to us is the biggest that every time there's new leadership we have to go in and articulate the benefits. It's well spent. It's not the image that people have in the past, and so right now I think there's a lot of intensity a to make sure we get that message out and get both in terms of the executive branch and the Congress to maintain amazing things like the president's malaria initiative or Pepfar, which is an HIV thing.

Speaker 3:          00:22:26       These things started under President Bush. And so our foundation's had a great working relationship with democratic and Republican administrations. Most people wouldn't realize that US foreign aid as a percentage of the economy, which is generally how it's measured, reached its low point in 1999, uh, under the Clinton administration. Now, I'm not saying it was the administration, it was a mix of the administration and the Congress. Uh, then, uh, during those Bush years, it went up fairly substantially. Now the economy helped with that, but these initiatives were really amazing and you know, I'm hopeful that maintaining or even growing these initiatives will be a priority when there's a lot of talk about tax cuts and different spending activities. And so it is a bit up in the air, uh, during these months ahead. And you've often made the point that no matter how big the private contributions are, sometimes in terms of tiers, sheer scale, you need a government.

Speaker 3:          00:23:28       Yeah, somebody asked me today, you know, it Pepfar, which is, this aids program was canceled when private philanthropy and make up for it. Well pepfar's over 5 billion year. That is this one aid program, which is a phenomenal thing that's saved a over 10 million lives that's larger than our foundation, which is, uh, the largest in the world. So there's no possibility the government sector, US, UK, other European donors, that's $130,000,000,000 here in coal that's uplifting these poor countries in health and education. And if we lose the consensus around that, if, if people draw inward too much, the we will hurt progress and there will be millions of lives lost because of it. One thing that might be mentioned, Charlie, who is that

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       the difference between now and 60 or 70 years ago in the ability of really bright people, really innovative, really energetic people to get financed to do things is, is dramatically better than than it was at that time. So now if you've got good ideas and there's good ideas right in those crowd and you've got energy, it's far easier to get financing to move forward. Those ideas then you couldn't 50 or 60 years. Is that because of the internet or crowds crowd sourcing of what is it? Just lots more capital and people more optimistic about it. People are very optimistic on business, but better ways to connect the tail capital and absolutely the idea, it's dramatic. It's dramatic and willingness to take risk. Uh, you know, the first venture capital stuff is in the 19 sixties and it's tiny. Uh, Microsoft, when we were taking outside investment, we took a, uh, at a valuation of $20,000,000, we took a million dollars for five percent of the company.

Speaker 3:          00:25:23       I'll do it retroactive. And you had your chance, you had your chance. We, we, we never spent the money. That is our business was profitable enough. We really didn't need to do that, but we wanted people on our board to give us advice. And uh, there's an episode of Silicon Valley where all these venture capitalists are courting this guy. And that really reminded me a lot. It was like by that time, which was 1984, there were dozens of venture capitalists and that's something that other countries have tried to duplicate and they found a in small part, but not nearly as well. This, this willingness to take risks. The idea that if you have the failure, it's not a mark of shame that, hey, what's your next startup going to be? You heard of sacred pumps. He gets his ideas from Silicon Valley a card, let's say where the cards are. Okay, number three, take the cart right there.

Speaker 7:          00:26:20       So you started this talk about how you're able to make a model and it won't accurately predict what happens. And on the other side of the coin, I was wondering what happens when you create such well developed predictive technology and what are the ramifications and implications of that outcome?

Speaker 3:          00:26:41       Well, I don't think our predictive, uh, you know, was going to be like an oracle warm nickname is the oracle of Omaha. But you know, the percentage of times you can predict things like macro economics because they involve a emotional sentiment. You know, we're a long ways away from that. The biggest modeling thing I'm involved in as a group that models diseases, so we look at HIV or tuberculosis and understand, okay, what do we have to do in terms of diagnosis and drugs to get these things down. Once we finished polio will go on and our next big challenge, which will take decades, but I expect we'll be done in my lifetime is malaria eradication. So these models aren't nearly at the point where they can take human sentiment into consideration, into the field of economics at a very basic question about what we should have done differently before the financial crisis. There really is no consensus whether it's with the public or inside the professional economists. They agree that some of the emergency treatment we did was necessary and important. And you know, I wish I was better understood, but the, in terms of the root causes, it's actually a little disconcerting how little our models, our understanding a explain how that imbalanced got so extreme.

Speaker 2:          00:28:11       Alright, where are number two?

Speaker 7:          00:28:17       I'm in school here at Columbia and I wanted to ask, you were talking about that you love reading. I wanted to ask you if you have a particular book that it changed your life, like the way you think about things and I also wanted to ask, um, what is the thing that you admire the most about each other? Like you build about worrying and the other way around. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:28:38       They sort of touched on the, on the second question, but go ahead and maybe want to add to it books though first changed your life. Well, a book that changed my life when it was bio fellow who taught here at Columbia, Benjamin Graham and I read the book when I was 19 called the intelligent investor and I'd, I'd been interested in investments since I was maybe seven or eight, but I'd never. And I'd read every book in the Public Public Library. Why do you think you were interested in investing when you were seven or eight? Because I was too dumb to get interested in. Poor.

Speaker 4:          00:29:14       My Dad, my dad had it

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       very small investment for and I would just get on, I read all the books that he had there, waiting to go to a luxury or whatever it might be, and then I went to the public library and read them all and it just was a fascinating subject to me and and but I didn't have any. I knew what everybody thought and all of that at an early age, but what Graham wrote made sense. I just happened to pick that book up at a bookstore in Lincoln, Nebraska to per se did. Is there something about your core competence that made investing in the perfect place for you to be? It certainly wouldn't be a pro football player. I loved her. It was a question of zeroing out the other incompetencies and I was left with one thing. No, I just allocation of capital. I was actually wired in a way that was just wouldn't be something I would be good at.

Speaker 2:          00:30:08       What so what? Why I didn't what way high. I can't tell you precisely, but I, I, I've got the right temperament for it, which is much more important than Iq. If you've got more than 120 points of Iq, so sell the rest of somebody else. You don't need it investments, which, but you do need the right temperament. You do it. You don't have to be able to think for yourself. And getting back to the uh, earlier question, the first question I asked myself, when I look at the businesses, you know, is it important and easy, what I can determine about this business? And a lot of them don't make it. Now Bill is looking for hard questions that plague society and where intellect, the money may make a difference. They may not for awhile, but he's taking on the tough things. I take my job is to find easy things.

Speaker 2:          00:30:54       I'm looking for one foot bars to step over, you know, rather than eight foot bar to jump over. But that's not irrational if you're, if you're looking at the investment universe. But reading is key. I on the biography, on the, on the book thing. I know I will tell you a wonderful book to read. I can tell you a number of intelligent investor would obviously if you're in the investment field, but Katharine Graham's autobiography is a marvelous book and that's absolutely honest, told by an incredible woman who had an incredible life and then honestly and someone who you knew very well adjusted with him and she was a bit reluctant and had to be assured that she was afraid of me actually a book. But what makes that book so much? It just, it is such a broad range of human experience, honestly told. I mean you couldn't have nobody in Hollywood could write up a, you know, a scenario that she lived through and, and just just see that world develop how she reacted to it and you can learn so much. My partner, Charlie Margaret just loves Ben Franklin. You know, I mean, he, I mean, you know, it. You can learn from other people and their mistakes. And I find a biography. It was my favorite part of the reason you love biographies, Barbie. Part of the reason you love biographies. Where is it card? Uh, right here, just come here. I, I'm having a hard time seeing the card. So that right here where the hands are raised.

Speaker 8:          00:32:29       Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:32:32       I'm a senior here at the college. I'm also a gates millennium scholar. My family over here.

Speaker 3:          00:32:42       So I'd like to ask. So what both of you do and a lot of risk and sometimes you have to face the fear of failure without risks. So I'm asking how did you overcome that fear and what steps did you take to do that? Well, I think I was very lucky that uh, when I was in high school, the computer was brought in there and I developed a fascination for, became kind of fanatical about it so that, you know, I didn't view it as risky. I viewed it as this kind of fun hobby. Even when I went to college, which I didn't finish, but I spent time in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the, I wasn't sure that would be my life's work. Now as the chip came along and made it mainstream, it became very obvious that something dramatic was going to happen. And so my, my passion, my hobby and the area I could start this company right at the beginning of the revolution that coincided in a nice way.

Speaker 3:          00:33:49       And I never felt it was risky. I, you know, if Microsoft had failed, I didn't have kids or anything, I could go back to school and uh, you know, finished my degree and go get a job somewhere. I was very risk averse in, in running the company. I always made sure we had enough money in the bank to pay everybody for at least a year if nobody paid us at all because this idea, I was hiring people who had kids and families and they were moving to work there. And here I was, you know, 19, 20 years old and sort of telling these people I'd be paying their salaries. So I was actually very conservative on a financial point of view. And one of the few arguments I have with Steve Balmer, who came in and played a phenomenal role in the success of the company was how many people could he hire a [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:34:46       I was trying to be so conservative, but I let him go full speed and uh, you know, it turns out our financial success meant that we never had a conflict about that. But, you know, I think it's great to be risk taking, uh, particularly when you're young trying out different things, fields that aren't very popular that you might enjoy, but I never got into a position where I was taking a, actually in any meaningful sense. I was taking a big risk. I mean, the risk of you would not do have acted because you felt the train was leaving the station. Yeah. And it was so clear, uh, that, you know, this was going to happen and this was so much fun. I mean, you know, I was a fanatic. I didn't believe in weekends. I didn't believe in vacation. Uh, my mom had to negotiate with her. I'd come once a week for dinner. Uh, no matter who the guest was. That's right. That's right.

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       But Warren, you have often said you still tap dance to work adequate. You can paint with your own colors. Yeah. I, I, I get, I'm as excited about tomorrow in terms of what is going to happen if I wasn't when I started. I was having a lot of fun when I started, but I'm having just as much fun now and, and I was. When I was here at Columbia, I had terrible fairer. It was impossible for me to speak in public. I mean I wasn't able to do it. I actually read an ad in the New York Times. I went down to midtown, signed up for a course, gave the guy a check and then stopped payment on the check. I mean it just, I just petrified. But finally I actually, after you get through, we're here with me today. Maybe your wish I'd stayed afraid of public speaking, but that's another question.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       When I got out of the home, all I finally decided just had to do it. So I gave a guy $100 in cash and once I bartered with other dollars in cash, I jump off the Grand Canyon to get my money. So it changed my life. But I would say this don't fear failure. Almost everything that's turned out, I got turned down by Harvard is the best thing ever happened among others. Some good things that happened that seemed good at the time. Don't worry about it. Don't let it eat at you or look back. Just keep going because you're going to have some things and forgot them. Go, go forward. I want to go to the back of the room. I back there wherever number three is.

Speaker 9:          00:37:00       Hi, my name is matthew man. I'm a first year at Columbia business school. Both of you had a moment where you went out on your own and I guess my question would be if you were to do it all over again, you're in our shoes. What industry would that be in? Where would you start your own business today?

Speaker 2:          00:37:18       I did the same thing. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:37:22       but one thing I'd be a failure than anything else probably. I mean, no, I mean I've had. I had fun when I was in my twenties, in my thirties. Now I made $86, 75, so I, I advise students as much as possible. Look for the job that you would take if you didn't need a job. I mean you don't sleep, walk through life, but don't, don't say it's all going to be great and I'll do this and I'll do that, you know, I'm just marking time to get to be older that I've told people. That's like saving up sex for your old age.

Speaker 4:          00:37:53       Yeah, there's not a good idea. What are you urging them to do? I'll explain. Guess what I'm talking about

Speaker 2:          00:38:13       it just, yeah, you really want to be doing what you love doing and you can't necessarily find it on your first job. Right? But don't give up before you find it.

Speaker 9:          00:38:24       No. You've had the unique experience a because of your curiosity be because of your involvement in, in global health. Just see the impact of a lot of other areas, uh, whether it's biomedicine

Speaker 3:          00:38:37       or whether it's, you know, a whole range of other things other than computer science. If you were going to drop out of Harvard today, which field would you be most likely attracted to? Well, I love the hard sciences and there's some phenomenal things that people will get a chance to be part of a, I'd still probably pick computer science because the work in artificial intelligence today is that a really profound level, uh, in, uh, our ability not just to play games, but that is a profound milestone. The alphago work that the deep mine people at Google were able to achieve and that kind of technologies and all the leading companies and a lot of the universities with Ai, creation of agents, the ability to read and understand material, it is going to be phenomenal. So anything connected with that I think would be an exciting lifetime career.

Speaker 3:          00:39:35       I also think in energy we have the imperative to have energy that's reliable, cheap and clean and no system available today can provide that, whether it's for rich countries or four per poor countries. And so the innovations there will be profound and there's many paths that could provide that solution. Finally, I think biology, it's the most thrilling time, you know, we are going to figure out a obesity cancer, her, even things that are very hard like depression because the, you know, the mind is, is, is even more complicated than other parts of the body. I see this through the lens of the diseases of the poor, of the infectious disease where new vaccines, new drugs, we are moving faster than ever. And some of these are platform technologies like DNA vaccines that are going to give us, just that one thing will give us lots and lots of solutions. And so working in that space, uh, is, is phenomenal. Now I say this to my children, uh, and you know, they, they may not want to do hard sciences. The one who's picked wants to counsel patients and, and be a doctor and even more than the science piece, that relationship with patients is what grabs her. So everybody has their own taste. But in terms of big impact, those three higher science problems would be at the top for me. Alright, next, right here, right next to number one.

Speaker 3:          00:41:09       Hello? Uh, thank you guys for being here. Also, thank you to Mr Gates. I am also a gates scholar and without your foundation I'm going to be here. Uh, many industrial based communities have been severely affected with higher levels of unemployment due to the increasing utilization of automation which ends up displacing workers. What do you mean? What do you believe is a possible solution to unemployment arising from automation? It's a good question because there's a lot of about globalization and all of that and a lot of other people step forward and, and talk about how technology and the impact technology is having on jobs and, and the demand for new kinds of skills.

Speaker 2:          00:41:44       Yeah. And we were here in 1800 and conducting this and somebody would point out that eventually tractors would come along and, and better fertilizer and had that 80 percent of the people are now employed on the farm and in a couple of hundred years it's going to be two or three percent. And what are we going to do with all these people? Well, the answer is we release them. We Keynes wrote something about it and something called essays on persuasion and he wrote a 1930 about what a more prosperous society would become, like any actually postulated that, uh, in 100 years and we're now 87 years old from the, that there would be four to eight times as much output per capita and he's remarkable, but he didn't quite get out my get distributed. But the idea more output per capita, which is what the progress is made on productivity, that, that should be harmful, decide is, is crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:42:40       I mean the distribution may be a problem, but if one person could push a button and turn out everything we turned out now is that good for the world, are bad for the world. You know, you'd have to figure out how to distribute it. But, but you'd free up all kinds of possibilities for everything else. So you, every, everything should be devoted initially to getting greater productivity. But people who fall by the wayside through no fault of their own, as the goose lays, golden eggs should still get a chance to participate in that prosper me. And that's where government comes in, right? Building to add to that. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:43:16       the problem of excess is a different problem than a problem shortage. You know, if all the tractors, computer stopped working, then we would have problems of shortage there. Uh, and you know, we just wouldn't have enough people to, to make the output a problem of excess really forced us to look at the individuals affected and take those extra resources and make sure that they're directed to them in terms of reeducation and incomes policies and the need for labor in terms of smaller class size, helping handicap kids, reaching out to the elderly. The demand for Labor is not at zero. If you ever get to that point, fine, you can shorten the work week and uh, you'll, you'll be just fine with that. And so the, this idea of taking an individual who during their generation is affected, I think there's a lot to be learned about that. A lot of thinking we have to do, but the macro picture that it enables, uh, is, is, is an opportunity number two. Also, I'm urging people at the back. So you have a chance and we want to go back up to the balcony as well. Uh, so when I see number six, welcome to six after two. Yes. Hi, my name is Sam. I go to Columbia College and my question is, what steps did you think needs to be taken in order to improve public education, particularly in a economically depressed areas of the United States?

Speaker 3:          00:44:48       Yeah,

Speaker 8:          00:44:49       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:44:51       I think this is a super important issue because the uh, dropout rates, although they've gone down a little bit, they're still very high end and very based on income and even kids who graduate, a lot of them don't enter college or they do enter college and they end up in these remedial courses for their reading or math capabilities. And those people have an extremely high dropout rate from higher education and, and they can incur debt. They have a negative experience. So we have a long ways to go in education. There are some very strong points of light, like here in New York City, some of the charter schools are with even less resources. Then schools that large doing a phenomenal job of educating kids. There are a lot of countries, particularly in Asia who spending way less of their GDP on education, are doing a great job educating their kids and it's not just the top 20 percent, they're bottom 20 percent is pretty phenomenal in the case of China, South Korea and Singapore.

Speaker 3:          00:46:00       And so looking at what we've learned in charter schools in terms of building the culture, giving teachers feedback, uh, what is good teaching look like? Do we give teachers a chance to learn from each other about that interactive element that makes the subject seem relevant and important? There are great teachers, but spreading those practices is, has been very, very tough. And so I'd say it's a, a top priority and we've taken our foundation has that for our work in the United States. Education is, is the top priority. Whereas outside the US, uh, we, we take on health. It's a tough problem because the institution of education are fairly resistant to change and people are, are not yet convinced by various approaches very easily. Uh, but we need to keep at it. We're going to, you know, stay in actually putting in more money into trying to help help models. Okay. I'm up number six.

Speaker 8:          00:47:00       Hey,

Speaker 10:         00:47:01       first they weren't the time. Well, I witnessed the role of your foundation and eliminating polio in India and I'm really thankful for that. Uh, my, my question is more on how to set the basic level of debate in any, any public sense. Like there are many trade of how to explain climate change policy for people who are losing, losing jobs in the coal sector. How do you balance the current current short term economic goals with the longterm

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       peaceful transition to renewable sources of energy?

Speaker 3:          00:47:35       No, it's a good question. The certain topics are so complicated like climate change, that to really get a broad understanding is a bit difficult. I'm particularly when people take any of that complexity and trying and create uncertainty about it. Uh, and in, uh, for example, India's kind of paradigmatic in that they want to electrify for all sorts of good reasons having to do with health and reading at night and a quality of life. And the question of should they delay electrification, uh, for climate issues is going to be very difficult. The ideal is to innovate in such a way that they can go full speed ahead on electrification without emitting the two that a, the natural path of them today, which is coal is the way to go. And so we have a lot of cost reduction to do because rich countries may be able to buy premium electricity when you get to middle income or lower, that's just not going to happen.

Speaker 3:          00:48:42       And you know, democracy has this allocate these resources in terms of investing in the future and things like research and investing in, in the present. And when you have a problem like the financial crisis, then you do get a little bit of more of short term thinking. And I'm hopeful. I think it's better for the world and for the country if we can get back into a little bit more of a focus on the longterm. We have some question from facebook. Warren central tenant of your investing is to invest for the long term. And this comes from Brian White who says how my bill and weren't convinced investors to think beyond short term returns, to encourage world changing innovation.

Speaker 6:          00:49:29       Well, I've spent my life trying to convince people on the testing for the longterm and listen to vinyl, how to double my money tomorrow. I'd probably have most with the short term, it's much. It's much easier to invest for the long term if you're just talking pure investment because you know what's going on in my view, be very high. Probably what's going to happen 10, 20 years from now in a major way. And I don't have the faintest idea what's gonna happen tomorrow or next week. But you wouldn't get if you're talking about societal, uh, it, it's, it's very tough because politicians, they selections either every two years or six years. And the way the way a particular integrational districts have been organized, primaries have become more and more important. And so it's very hard to have a politicians think of something as wonderful for the country for 20 years, but will cost

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       them the election two years from now. And that, that's a basic problem in a democracy and it gets to be more of a problem as, as we get arraigned, we've arranged congressional districts, so the primary dominates because a very limited number of people turned out in their motive, tend to be on the extremes of both parties. So it, uh, it's not easy whether you're going to make an investment in a company or whether you're going to buy the company. What are the factors that you have to be that you're looking for? Which test? I'm looking for durable, competitive advantage. I'm looking for something that has a moat around it for a considerable period of time and I'm looking for and I'm honest, enabled management to run it because I don't know how to run it myself. And I'm looking for a purchase price that's not excessive, but it's better to pay a little too much for something that's a very good business a than it is to buy some bargain, a but really the company, but not much of a future.

Speaker 2:          00:51:21       And I don't know, I don't have a ability to predict with a high probability of success the future of most companies, so I'm looking for the exception. But the nice thing is if there's thousands of companies out there, I really don't have to be right on a couple of. I mean it's exactly the opposite of, of baseball where you have called strikes and the pitcher is trying to throw it to it. The worst part of the strike zone for you. And if he succeeds in getting into that corner three times and you don't swing, you're out in investing. It's a no, it's an old called strike things. I can sit there all day and somebody confirming one company after another. And finally I got one of my sweet spot. Both of you have chosen both wives and partners. Well, I'm Charlie monger added what? Charlie Munger changed my views.

Speaker 2:          00:52:12       He'd be flying them in a huge way in terms of looking for the quality companies and, and, and looking for the ability to make an investment that would work out well for five or 10 or 20 years as opposed to something that might. There might be one I called it a cigar, but investing, whether it was one puff left in the cigar, the cigar was free. So he picked up these disgusting looking things and got one puff out of them, went onto another one and that worked okay. But it was small scale and it really doesn't build something satisfying. So, so he, he kept forcing me in the direction of saying, you know, is this really a business we want to own for forever? And, and, uh, do we want to get. So it's like a marriage. I mean, do you want to get associated with this person forever? And it's a great way to look at things. A bill, uh, your wife, Melinda has added what?

Speaker 3:          00:53:02       Well, she's four children, three children. How much time do I have? She is your partner and she was there in the philanthropy from day one at Microsoft. I had two partners for Mason. I had Paul Allen really early days and then Steve bombers when

Speaker 2:          00:53:21       it got bigger and we would not have achieved anything what we without those

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       partnerships, because you know, when things are tough, when you're making big decisions, having somebody who's really in there with you committed a for me. I couldn't have done without that, for the foundation. Melinda's an amazing partner. She thinks about the people issues better than I do. She knows when I get over excited about the science, she can, uh, you know, make sure we're, we're being realistic about it and it makes it fun. You know, last week, uh, I went to Europe to world economic form. She went to Nigeria and then this weekend we just sat and talked about, okay, what did we see, what does that say about the work we should do a. and so, you know, I don't think I'd enjoy it without a partner in particularly someone amazing like her.

Speaker 6:          00:54:12       It's more fun with a partner. I'm in Charlotte and I've had more fun working together that neither one of us would have had individually and we have never had an argument after

Speaker 2:          00:54:21       being together for 58. You could talk every day. Not Anymore. We know what the other guy's going to say. We just got, we talked it all out 15 years ago. So if you see trolley and he says, why haven't you called? And you'd say, well, I knew what you say anyway. No, there's no question about it. What am. I shall have a lot of fun together. Alright, right there. Let's say number two.

Speaker 3:          00:54:45       Hi.

Speaker 7:          00:54:46       Hi, my name is molly is anger. I'm a student at Barnard College. Um, I guess what I'm basically wondering is what your main considerations are when you're choosing where to donate and what causes to donate to and what the main challenges are that are associated with that.

Speaker 6:          00:55:02       Yeah, I wholesale it because I made a choice that I wanted to have a. well originally my first wife and I planned that I would pile up and she went on pile it. But uh, and then, uh, that was plan number one. But she, she died, uh, in, in 2004, and then I had the problem of figuring out the best way to distribute what turned out to be a lot of money and I wanted, I wanted some people who had similar values and similar objectives and what I have, but I also want to, people would pour in intelligence and energy in case of bill and Melinda, a lot of their own funds, we'll work out a full time, but who really saw society as I sought, which was at every life is of equal value in and that if you start with that and then you figure what your might be good at changing whether it's medicine or education or early learning or whatever it may be. A, you know, that was my answer was that the wholesale and retail philanthropy would drive me crazy. But wholesale,

Speaker 2:          00:56:04       we are really like

Speaker 3:          00:56:08       bill. Yeah. For our work at the foundation, the belief in innovation, which, uh, both Melinda and I sought Microsoft. Our question was, okay, how do we bring that kind innovation to help the world's poorest in. We learned that coming up with new vaccines that although you can pay a lot to have them created, the marginal cost comes down to less than a dollar, so great getting a new vaccine for the main cause of diarrhea or our pneumonia, uh, that can be a phenomenal thing. So you're looking for these super nonlinear dramatic things because as you know, per poor person are compared to government funding, philanthropy is actually quite small and yet the funding vaccine projects, the government isn't as good as that as a philanthropist who assembles a team. And over time it's learning how to do that very well. And we had models in a Rockefeller Foundation was a phenomenal foundation.

Speaker 3:          00:57:11       The green revolution is just one of many things that they did, which raised agricultural productivity and saved, avoided hundreds of millions, a starving. And so studying the other foundations that have taken these big breakthroughs, uh, and created model out of those that was very informative to the, to what we've gone after. What's the most important lesson you've learned though, about making investments from the foundation today that you learned along the way? Well, I think, uh, when we started out, I thought that just coming up with the new vaccine or drug alone would be enough and that the world would then take that and get it out to all the children of the world. Uh, you know, partly through field this, I did that Melinda did, looking at the statistics, that delivery system, it doesn't get out to a lot of the kids. And so having to figure out how people are hired or how that was funded and measure this, what's called primary health care, uh, we were drawn into that out of necessity.

Speaker 3:          00:58:17       It didn't fit the normal sort of in the lab, you know, come up with this great concoction and uh, and yet in order to achieve our goals, we needed to, to think about those delivery pieces. In fact, sometimes the state of the product actually had to be simpler in some ways in order to get through that very limited delivery capacity. And now we're getting to 86 percent of the world's children with vaccines. It was, uh, about 70 percent when we got started. So that's good increase. We still have have 14 percent to go, one that have amazing a convening and persuasive powers as well. So I mean they, they bring something far more to it than just money. I mean they, they work incredibly hard and do my three children in their foundations, but they work incredibly hard at getting governments involved in vaccines or whatever it may take. And that, uh, that just as you know, it's an extra dimension that I think very few people have in the field.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       It's a hands on travel to Melinda is in Africa and she's holding a little baby. I mean she is actually thinking, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:59:31       this good needs to be vaccinated, has a decent chance in education, all that. I feel the same way about the kid, but what I really think is going to have a pee on me and on head was going, I had. So you know, there's just a difference in that human touch that makes a big difference. I'm halfway in between. I think he's closer to me number three and number four, first one, then three, then four small me at the Columbia business school. If the current government were to ask for your advice on immigration or healthcare reform, what would you recommend to them?

Speaker 4:          01:00:06       Lauren?

Speaker 2:          01:00:07       Well, on him, on immigration. Well, immigration. I mean this country is built on it. I always say to people through immigration, let's put it in retroactively. Everybody leaves this country and you think about it.

Speaker 6:          01:00:26       Overdose before from me, but we're sitting here in part because of two. George immigrants who in 1939 and August signed the most important letter perhaps in the history of the United States and you can. You can go to the Internet and go to search thing and

Speaker 4:          01:00:44       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:00:52       and just type in Einstein. Roosevelt 1939.

Speaker 6:          01:00:55       Leo's Alard and Albert Einstein to immigrants came here. They both. They came directly from Germany, large came from Hungary before that and they told President Roosevelt that the Germans were likely to develop an atom bomb which was likely to work. It's less than a full page and we'd better get to work on something fast and that the Manhattan project came out of that and it hadn't been for those two immigrants. Who knows whether we'd be sitting in this room,

Speaker 4:          01:01:27       immigration,

Speaker 2:          01:01:29       I'm gonna, let him handle, can do Andy Grove. You'd go up and down, right? It's, this country has been built on the west. Exactly why? By immigrants and you can take them from any country.

Speaker 6:          01:01:45       Pretty good one. And then they'd come here and they've found something that unleash the potential that the place where they left did not have, were the product of it. Let me, the question also is about healthcare. I mean, what can you tell us about healthcare that you think is important in terms of the consideration of what might happen? I mean, if you were building a healthcare plan for America, what would be the elements that you would want to

Speaker 4:          01:02:13       include?

Speaker 6:          01:02:15       Well, there's no doubt that in order to provide decent healthcare,

Speaker 3:          01:02:21       the percentage of GDP devoted to it is going to go up over time. It's already very high and yes, there's some efficiencies to be gained, uh, in that, you know, 18 percent are so number. But as society ages, as we come up with new things like joint replacement, organ transplant, which are going to create lots of human benefits, we're going to have to have more resources overall, including more government resources for healthcare. And so it's a tough problem because you have both access problems today and you have costs problems today. And you know, whenever I look at a problem, I have this one simple lens which has those innovation should help here, but in this case, innovation, while it will provide breakthrough drugs that will save costs, like if you can cure Alzheimer's, which we certainly haven't done yet, that will save on huge longterm care costs.

Speaker 3:          01:03:22       So we have these chronic diseases that we've made less progress on, uh, than, than some of the others. And you know, the market mechanism to get Pharma to go after those things. And the basic research, those funds, I am quite optimistic that we'll have some advances, but they'll also give us some very expensive things that will mean we're, we're spending more money against it. And I do hope you know that at some point that we really are calling on the best minds to look at the incentives for the breakthroughs, the most efficient system we have here. I think there's a lot of unhappiness in the country now. A stems from the fact that the healthcare system isn't delivering. And yet, uh, you know, people are saying less government, more government, uh, you know, I don't think they're being given the depth of education about why it's so tough that over time will help them a vote for the rest of the depth of explanation. Let me go, I'll go to facebook and just a moment, but where was I promised three, four to six. A three is there and six is up there. So go three, six and we'll go to facebook.

Speaker 11:         01:04:35       Hi, my name is Josh Schaffer and I'm a dental resident at Columbia. My question is for future doctors and dentists of America. What, what advice do you have in giving about having a proper balance of providing that health care, but also mastering the concepts of business and economics?

Speaker 3:          01:04:58       Well, it told Gawande is incredible. Author. He, in the current issue of the New Yorker has a, uh, the latest in a wonderful articles about the healthcare system and he's talking about the people who do sort of heroic surgery, like are paid twice as much as the people who are on an ongoing basis and a great incremental way learning about the patient and seeing what works for them. And He, it's a calling to say, hey though, that part of the system needs to be run better, needs, needs more resources. Uh, and, you know, so I think it's brilliant that he's saying that. And it also corresponds to what, uh, what is working in some other countries. A six.

Speaker 7:          01:05:48       Hello, my name is Columbia College. So you both have invested a great deal of money abroad, but there is a prevailing belief by some that there are pressing issues in America. There are poor people here, there are sick people here and we should deal with that first before even tackling anything abroad. So what are your thoughts on that?

Speaker 6:          01:06:08       My own personal thought is that every life is of equal value and uh,

Speaker 4:          01:06:15       in many ways,

Speaker 6:          01:06:22       many ways, if you have a limited number of dollars, you actually can do more for more people outside the United States. We do have greater resources here for our 320 million people that exists around the world for seven plus billion people. So if, if you, you can improve the lot of more people by intelligently spending a billion dollars or any other number, uh, in other areas of the world actually then here. And I know coming from Omaha and having the money, I have people say, well, why not spend it all in? You know, you grow up hearing, almost done all kinds of things for you. And I absolutely acknowledge that. But in the end, if I've got x dollars to spend, I can make life better for more people if I can have it intelligently allocated in other parts of the world actually than the United States. And that draws a fair amount of criticism. But I live with because I just. What I believe

Speaker 2:          01:07:14       all lives have equal value is really the driving force behind my foundation. I'm an accident. I won the ovarian lottery when I was born in the United States in 1930. He was 40 to one against me. I was male that now it's 80 to one against being a male in the United States in 1930. I was just plain lucky my life had been partnered with. Bill always said if I had been born a long time ago, I'd have been some animals lunch because I can't run fast and I can't climb trees and everything. And I'd be saying I allocate capital and wouldn't work. And I was lucky but 79 out of the 80 weren't as lucky as I was at that time. Bill, go ahead bill. Is it

Speaker 3:          01:07:54       the helping people in other countries? The foreign aid budget of the US is, is point eight percent of the budget and there will be in, in the years ahead and discussion about is that we're doing it saves lives for typically about a thousand dollars of life saved and in terms of stability and countries, uh, eventually being self sufficient and be part of the world economy. There are some, some huge benefits to that. So if we were talking about should we spend 20 or 30 percent overseas? Okay. You know, that would be a very interesting discussion. But what we're trying to preserve a is something that's gotten smarter and smarter all the time, has proven benefits, all of which are things that our foundation core invests, invests in the same things like, like the polio thing is, is point eight percent. So I'm hopeful that in a big world that can remain a priority. Or. Let me go to another facebook question. This is from uh, uh, Nadia says, how might bill and Warren encouraged innovation, particularly among teens and young adults? How do you encourage innovation?

Speaker 2:          01:09:08       Well, I think you have a market system provides rewards for it yet and we haven't, I mean we, we have an incubator for innovation in the United States and you know, broken of school. Andy Grove can come from Hungary and I mean it just welcomes it and thank God, I mean that's why we have the kind of prosperity that we have. I mean the question of how it gets divided as a secondary question and that is not good solid as well by the market system, but our system is just designed for it and look at what is happening.

Speaker 3:          01:09:43       Number one. Also, I want to make sure we get the people that back so we would only have five minutes left so there's a couple of hands up in the back so please recognize it.

Speaker 12:         01:09:53       Hi, my name is Scott here. I'm a senior and the junior school as men have such great influence. Uh, I'm curious, and we touched a little bit about this, the last question, but how you deal with reconciling your convictions with maybe what is believed by the public, maybe even a majority considering that you have the wealth and power and fame to make such great things happen

Speaker 3:          01:10:19       either. Well, I don't see, you know, the, the convictions I have a, you know, I love sharing them and talking to people and understanding where people disagree. Uh, you know, I can be overly science centric about things. I, uh, you know, there's all sorts of clauses that are super important that our foundation, because we have limited resources, we don't get to go and do. There's, there's lots of diseases. Uh, there's aspects of education in a part of the strength of philanthropy is its diversity and, and, and so just by sharing the fact that it's fun, it really can have measurable impact. I hope that sets an example for all of philanthropy. I don't happen to believe that, you know, my voice should be that much louder than other people. Uh, you know, and so, you know, some of these big political donations, you know, at least, uh, you know, I and worn as well, you know, we've chosen not to have that be a huge way that we're spending our money. That's a personal choice. Uh, you know, the money's being saved for, not for the megaphone, but for the work of the foundation. We got a podium over certain short, but people do not

Speaker 6:          01:11:43       with a partner like Charlie monger, you don't have to worry about my views being accepted, automatically point out the shortcomings of the, the influence of money in politics. I agree. The thing is, is bad news for this country, I think citizens united was a terrible decision and the idea that somebody can pour millions and millions of dollars into a campaign and in certain cases and not even be identified, I think really kind of

Speaker 3:          01:12:09       goes counter to kind of America, I believe in the two of you created along with blend and others created the giving pledge. How's that going? Going? Terrific. Go conducted. It really is going to. Philanthropy is kind of where it is. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. This is, um, you know, we love philanthropy of all types and part of the strength American clamp is actually people with very little who are incredibly generous here though we said, for the people who are, are super lucky to have over a billion dollars, we want a group who are working together who are committed to give the majority of their wealth away to learn from each other. What's worked, what hasn't worked, how do you involve your kids? Uh, how do you hire staff? And they'll find areas that are working on together and cooperate, but we're not pulling any money. And we thought we'd get 20, 25 people together.

Speaker 3:          01:13:06       And in fact, now we're at 156. So it is a wonderful yearly eventide made some great people. I do think that the quantity and quality has gone up because we're getting together. We'll never be able to measure that in a direct way in a, we're making special efforts in China and India because now we have a lot of welfare and that wasn't there before. And uh, in their own way, I think they, by having a strong philanthropic sector that will help those countries and therefore help the world was interesting. Now build an I are having dinner actually with the group tonight for example, but

Speaker 6:          01:13:44       you go back 100 or a hundred 50 years, people got wealthy by making some money from the oil refinery are still a mill and building another one and every Ford with Volvo plant them build cars and then they, it would be from actually from retained earnings which eventually turned into cash. Now you can get rich very young just by having an idea and you can get that idea monetize and capitalize in a way that you cannot believe. So we are particularly interested in getting younger people interested in philanthropy because there will be huge. There are huge fortunes by people that are now in their twenties and thirties. And just think of what those potential for that group. And so this thing has worked out way, way better, including getting younger people to join us. Number six.

Speaker 7:          01:14:29       Hello, my name is Christina Nunez. I'm a fellow dental student to Josh. Thank you for speaking with us today. Um, I'm curious about your insight related to relationships. I'm personally given a desire to honor myself and respect other individuals have found it difficult throughout life to discern which relationships to really foster and invest in and accept challenges from and which to kind of forgo and abandoned because there are more harmful than helpful. Um, so are there any major life lessons that you two have learned through your personal experiences?

Speaker 6:          01:15:09       Well, that's a very important question and the more you will move in the direction of the people that you associate with site, it's important to associate with people that are better than yourself. And actually the most important decision met. Ado Bank. Not all of you will be the spouse you choose. Okay. And, uh, you really, you want to associate with people who are the kind of person you'd like to be. You'll, you'll move in that direction. And the most important person by far in that respect is you respond to that. I can't over emphasize how important that is. You're right that the friends you have a, they will form you as you go through life and uh, uh, makes good friends, keep them for the rest of your life would have them be people that you admire as well as why come, they'll do that to that.

Speaker 3:          01:16:02       Yeah. Some friends do bring out the best in you,

Speaker 13:         01:16:04       uh,

Speaker 3:          01:16:05       and, and so those, it's good to invest in those friendships.

Speaker 13:         01:16:10       Uh,

Speaker 3:          01:16:12       and you know, some friends challenge you about things you're doing, uh, and that, you know, that level of intimacy is great. I wouldn't say that, um, you know, I was so obsessed with work. I didn't invest. I'd say in my twenties and thirties as much as I should have. It's really through Melinda and seen know other people. I realized, okay, that is really worth the investment, to have those people as a, you're always there to help them and vice versa.
