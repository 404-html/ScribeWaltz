Speaker 1:          00:07          I want to skip the flattery and the Atta boys because I do know this. The sooner that we become less impressed with our life, with our accomplishments, with our career, with whatever that prospect is in front of us, the sooner we become less impressed and more involved with that and these things, the sooner we get a whole lot better

Speaker 2:          00:30          doing them.

Speaker 1:          00:32          So I'm going to talk to you about some things that I've learned in my journey. Most of them experience, some of them I heard in passing, many of them I'm still practicing, but all of them I do believe are true. Now, they may be truth to me, but don't think that that makes them mine because you cannot own the truth. So please think of these as signpost approaches, paradigms that gives some science to satisfaction, yours to steal yours, to share, like into your own lives, to personally apply in your own lives, in your own way should you choose to. So here we go. Number one, life's not easy. Life is not easy. It is not. Don't try to make it that way. Life's not fair. It never was. It isn't. Now, and it won't ever be, do not fall into the trap, the entitlement trap of feeling like you're a victim. You are not. Get over it. Get on with it, and yes, most things are more rewarding when you break a sweat to get them. Number two, I love this. Unbelievable is the stupidest word. The dictionary should never come out of our mouth. Think about it to say, Oh wow, what an unbelievable play a. It was an unbelievable book and unbelievable film. Unbelievable active Kurt.

Speaker 2:          01:53          Really,

Speaker 1:          01:55          it may be spectacular. It may be phenomenal, most excellent or outstanding, but unbelievable. Give others and yourself more credit. It just happened. You witnessed it. You just did it. Believe it. What about the other side of unbelievable? You know that that side, when we humans under perform or act out of our best character, for instance, man flies a suicide jet into the World Trade Center. Millions die from diseases everyday that we have cures for. Bob, the builder swears that he's going to have your house built by Thanksgiving and you can't move in until Christmas. The next year. Our best friends lied to us and we lie to ourselves all the time.

Speaker 2:          02:42          Unbelievable. I don't think so.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Again, it just happens and it happens everyday. Nothing that we homo sapiens earthlings do is unbelievable, and if there's one thing you can depend on, people being

Speaker 2:          02:54          it's people,

Speaker 1:          02:56          so we shouldn't be surprised. We are the trickiest mammals walking the planet. I'm not worried about the monkeys. I'm worried about you and me, so acknowledged the acts of greatness as real and do not be naive about mankind's capacity for evil, nor be in denial of our own shortcomings. Happiness is an emotional response to an outcome. If I win, I will be happy. If I don't, I won't. It's an if then cause and effect. We had pro quo standard that we cannot sustain because we immediately raise it. Every time we attain it. You see happiness, happiness demands a certain outcome. It is result reliant and I say, if happiness is what you're after, then you're going to be let down frequently and you're going to be unhappy. Much of your time.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Joy though you always a different thing. It's something else. Joy is not a choice, it's not a response to some result. It's a constant joy is the feeling that we have from doing what we are fashioned to do, no matter the outcome. Now personally, as an actor, I started enjoying my work and literally being more happy when I stopped trying to make the daily Labor a means to a certain end. For example, a, I need this film to be a box office success. You know, I need my performance to be acknowledged. I, I need the respect of my peers are all of those are reasonable aspirations, but the truth is, as soon as the work, the daily making of the movie, the doing of the deed became the reward in itself for me. I got more box office, more accolades and respect than I ever had before. See, joy is always in process. It's under construction. It is in constant approach, alive and well in the doing of what we're fashioning to do and enjoying it. Number four, define success for yourself. Define success for yourself and check this out. I'm in south of New Orleans a few years ago and I went to a Voodoo shop and they had this, this, this wooden partition against the wall, at these columns, and in these columns where all these vials of these magic potion, right, and the headings above each potion, defining what they would give you were things like fertility, health, family, legal help, energy, forgiveness, money. Yes. Which column is empty?

Speaker 1:          05:40          My nae have to admit it. Money is king. Today is what make the world, makes the world go round. It is success. The more we have, the more successful we are right now. I would argue that our cultural values have even been financial. Humility is not in vogue anymore. It's too passive. It's a get rich quick on the Internet, riches, 15 minutes of fame world that we live in and we see it every day, but we all want to succeed. Right? So the question that we got to ask ourselves is, what success is to us? What success is to you? Is it more money as fine? I've got nothing against money. No. Maybe it's a healthy family. Maybe it's a happy marriage. Maybe it's to help others to be famous, to be spiritually sound, leave the world a little bit better place than you found it.

Speaker 1:          06:35          Continue to ask yourself that question. Now your answer may change over time and that's fine, but do yourself this favor. Whatever your answer is, don't choose anything that will jeopardize yourself. Prioritize who you are, who you want to be in. Don't spend time with anything that antagonizes your character. Don't drink the koolaid and it tastes sweet, but you will get cavities. Tomorrow. I live is not a popularity contest. Be Brave. Take the hill. But first answer that question. What's my hill? So me, how do I, how do I define success for me myself? Well, for me it's a measurement of five things. We got fatherhood, we got being a good husband. I've got my health, mind, body, and spirit. We've got career and we'd have friendships. These are what's important to me in my life right now. So I try to measure these five things each day.

Speaker 1:          07:34          I check in with them. I like to see whether or not I'm in the, uh, the, the debit section or the credit section with each one man in the red or I'm in the black. You follow for instance, sometimes say my career's rolling. Alright, it's way up here in the black, but I see my relationship with my wife maybe could use a little bit more of my attention. I got to pick up the slack on being a better husband. Get that one out of the red or say my spiritual health could use some maintenance. It's down here, but a man, my friendships and my social life there in high gear, right? I've got to recalibrate. Checks and balances. I gotta go to church. Remember to say thank you more often something, but I got to take the talent because I want to keep all five in healthy shape and I know that if I don't take care of them, if I don't keep up maintenance on them, one of them is going to get weak. Man, it's gonna dip too deep into the debit section. It's going to go bankrupt. It's going to get sick, die. So first we have to define success for ourselves and then we have to put in the work to maintain it. Take that daily tally, tend to our garden, keep the things that are important to us in good shape mean. Let, let, let's admit it. We've all got to wolves in a suit, a good one and a bad and they both want to eat

Speaker 1:          09:01          best. I can tell. We just got to feed that goodman a little more than the other one. Here we go. Number five, process of elimination is the first step to our identity, Aka where you are not is as important as where you are. Right? Nineteen 92. I got my first job as an actor. Three lines, three days work in a film called dazed and confused. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright,

Speaker 3:          09:34          there we go.

Speaker 1:          09:36          So this director of that film, Richard Linklater, he kept inviting me back to set each night putting me in more scenes which led to more lines, all of which I happily said yes to. I mean I'm having a blast. People were telling me I'm good at what I'm doing and they're writing me a check for $325 a day. I mean, hell yeah. Give me more scenes. I love what I'm doing. Well, by the end of the shoot, by the end of the film, those three lines and turned into over three weeks work and it was mine. It was Woodson's 1970 Chevelle that we went to go get aerosmith tickets in. Man. It was bad ass. Well, a few years ago I'm watching this film again and I noticed two seems I really shouldn't have been in and one of these scenes, my character wooderson I, I accept screen left to head somewhere and then I reentered the screen and double check if any of the other characters wanted to go with me now in rewatching the film and you agree, if you know wooderson what? Kristen's not a guy who would ever say later and then come back to see if you were sure you didn't want to go. Now when waterson leaves, orders is gone. He does not stutter. Step, flinch, rewind as twice or solicit. You know what I'm talking about Waterson, there's better things to do like liking those high school girls, man, because I get older and they stayed the same age point is I should not have been in that thing. It shouldn't have come back,

Speaker 1:          11:04          should've exited screen left and never come back, but back then making my first film, getting invited back to the set, cashing that check and having a ball. I wanted more screen time. I wanted to be in the scene longer and more and come back into the scene. Right? But I shouldn't have been there. Wooderson shouldn't have been there. It is just as important where we are not as it is, where we are. Look, the first step that leads to our identity. Life is usually not. I know who I am, I know who I am. That's not the first step. The first step, she usually I know who I am. Not

Speaker 1:          11:48          Process of elimination. Defining ourselves by what we are not is the first step that leads us to really know who we are. You know that group of friends that you hang out with that there really might not bring out the best in you, you know they gossip too much or that kind of shady really aren't going to be there for you in a pinch, or how about that bar that we keep going to that we always seem to have the worst hangover from or that computer screen, right? That computer screen that keeps giving us an excuse not to get out of the house and engage with the world and get some real human interaction or how about that food that would keep eating this stuff that tastes so good going down, it makes us feel like crap the next week when we feel lethargic and we keep putting on weight,

Speaker 1:          12:36          well those people, those places, those things stopped giving them your time and energy. Just don't go there. I put them down and when you do this, when you do put them down, when you could go in there and you couldn't given them your time, you inadvertently find yourself spending more time and in more places that are healthy for you that bring you more joy. Why? Because you just eliminated the WHO's the, where's the Watson, the winds that were keeping you from your identity, like, trust me, too many options. I promise you the too many options will make a tyrant of is all right, so get rid of the excess, the wasted time. Decrease your options. If you do this, you will have accidentally, almost innocently put in front of you what is important to you by process of elimination. No one who we are is hard. It's hard to give yourself a break. Eliminate who you are, not first and you're gonna. Find yourself where you need to be. I'm a six. Don't leave crumbs and the beauty of delayed gratification. So what a crumbs. The crumbs I'm talking about are the choices that we make that make us have to look over our shoulder in the future. He didn't pay that guy back the money that you owed him and tonight you just saw him. Three rail is behind you.

Speaker 4:          14:12          Shit.

Speaker 1:          14:15          You slept around on your spouse and you just found out that Tamara, she and the lady you were having an affair with are going to be at the same PTA meeting.

Speaker 4:          14:24          Shit again.

Speaker 1:          14:27          You drank too much last night. You're too hung over to drive. Your son is 8:00 AM, Saturday morning baseball practice. These are the crumbs. They come in the form of regret, guilt and remorse. You leave trump's today. They will cause you more stress tomorrow, and they disallow you from creating a customized future in which you do not have to look over your shoulder. So let's flip the script. Instead of creating outcomes that take from us, let's create more outcomes that pay us back. Fill us up. Keep your fire lit, turn you on for the most amount of time in your future. These are the choices I'm talking about and this is the beauty of delayed gratification. Tee yourself up. Do yourself a favor. Make the choices, the purchases today that pay you back tomorrow. Residuals in my business, we call it mailbox money. If I do my job well today and that movie keeps rerunning on TV, five years from now, I'm getting checks in the mailbox.

Speaker 1:          15:31          It's a heck of a deal, so whether it's prepping the coffee maker the night before, so all you got to do is press the button in the morning or getting ready for the job interview early so you don't have to cram the night before or chooses not to hook up with that married woman because you know you're going to feel horrible about it tomorrow and her husband carries a gun or paying your debts on time so that when you do see that guy three rows back tonight, you don't have to hunker down you seed hoping that he don't see you. Get some Roi. You know what that is? Return on investment. Your investment. You customize your future. Don't leave trumps. Number seven, dissect your successes and the rest of prosody of gratitude. We so often focus on failure, don't we? We studied failure. Obsess with failure. We dissect failure in our failures, dissect them so much. We end up intoxicated with them to the point of disillusion mean when we write in our diary, usually when we're depressed, what do we gossip about? Other people's flaws and limitations, and we can dissect ourselves into self-loathing if we're not careful. I find that most of the times our obsession with what is wrong just ends up breeding more wrong, more failure.

Speaker 1:          17:04          The easiest way to dissect success

Speaker 1:          17:08          is through gratitude, giving thanks for that, which we do have for what is working. Appreciating the simple things we sometimes take for granted. We give thanks for these things and that gratitude reciprocate, creating more to be thankful for it. It's really simple and it works. Now I'm not saying be in denial of your failures. Now we can learn from them too, but only if we look at them constructed as a means to reveal what we are good at, what we can get better at, what we do succeed at. I personally, I've read a whole lot of my bad reviews. All right. I've had quite few written by the more talented critics. They are the ones who give constructive, bad reviews. They reveal to me what did translate in my work, what came across, what was seen or what was it. Now, I don't obsess on the unfavorable aspect of their views review, but I do see what I can learn from it because their displeasure actually uncovers.

Speaker 1:          18:15          It makes more apparent what I do do well, what I am successful at, and then I just sat back. I live some verb. We try our best. We don't always do. Our best. Architecture is a verb as well. Yes, it is, and since we are the architects of our own lives, let's study the habits, the practices, the routines that we have that lead to end feed our success, our joy, our honest pain, our laughter, our earn tears. Let's dissect that and give thanks for those things and when we do that, guess what happens? We get better at them and we have more to dissect.

Speaker 1:          19:02          Number eight, make voluntary obligations, right? Mom and dad, since we were young, they teach us things as children, teachers, mentors, the government, and on laws. They all give this guidelines for which to navigate this life rules to abide by. In the name of accountability, I'm not talking about those obligations, I'm talking about the ones that we make with ourselves, with our God, with our own consciousness. I'm talking about the you versus you. Obligations we have to have now. Again, these are not societal laws and expectations that we acknowledge and endow for anyone other than ourselves. These are faith based obligations that we make on our own. These are not the lower insurance rates for a good driving record. You will not be fined or put in jail if you do not gratify these obligations. I speak of no one else covers these, but you. They are your secrets with yourself, your own private counsel, personal protocols, and while nobody throws you a party, when you abide by them, no one's going to arrest you when you break them either except yourself or some cops who got a disturbing the peace call at 2:30 in the morning because you were playing bongos.

Speaker 1:          20:25          You birthday suit. Yeah, that was me and honest man's pillow is, is peace of mind and when you lay down on that pillow at night, no matter who's in your bed, we all sleep alone. These are your personal jimminy cricket and there are not enough cops in the entire world to them.

Speaker 5:          20:48          It's on you. It's on you

Speaker 1:          20:53          now. Midnight from Cannes to want. Alright, check this out. In 1995 I got my first big paycheck as an actor. I think it was 150 grand. The film is almost boys on the side and we were shooting in Tucson, Arizona and I had this sweet little adobe guest house on the edge of this swirl, national park. The house came with a maid. My first made. It was awesome. So I got a friend over one Friday night and we're having a good time and I'm telling her about how happy I am with my setup. The house, the made, especially the maid. I'm telling her look like she cleans the place up. After I go to work, she washes my clothes, the dishes, put fresh water by my bed, leads me cooked meal. Sometimes she even presses my jeans and my friend, she smiles at me happy that I'm excited over this. She says, well, that's great matthew. Uh, if you like your jeans pressed. And I kinda looked up batter, my jaw hanging open. I stuttered a moment. Had that dumb ass slip that you get when you just been told the truth and you didn't think about it. And he hit me.

Speaker 1:          22:07          I hate that line going down in front of my jeans. I hate that line. And it was then for the first time that I noticed it, I never thought about not liking that starts sliding down the front of my genes because I'd never had a maid Dharma jeans before. And since she did. Now for the first time in my life, I just liked it because I could get it. I never thought about it, but I really wanted it. Well, I didn't want it there. That line. And that night I learned something just because you can.

Speaker 5:          22:39          Nah, come on.

Speaker 1:          22:41          It's not a good enough reason to do something. Even when it means having more, be discerning, choose it because you want it, do it because you want to

Speaker 1:          22:57          never had my jeans pressed again. A hate that line number 10, a roof is a man made thing. This may cut a little close to the bone since the geography, but I think we all were there and we uh, allow, remember where we were. But in January the third, 19, 93, he was the nfl playoffs in your Houston oilers for planning the buffalo bills. The olders rubbed 28 to three at halftime. Thirty five to three early in the third frank break and the bills come back to when? Forty one to 38 and over time for one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history. Yeah, the bills one. But they didn't really beat the, the others lost that game. They beat themselves.

Speaker 1:          23:49          Yeah, I remember that. Why? Why did they beat themselves or how was it? Because it halftime, they put a ceiling, a roof, a limit on their belief in themselves, Aka the prevent defense. Or maybe they started thinking about the next opponent in the playoffs. It halftime. I mean, they were up and they came out and played on their heels, lost the mental edge, the entire second half and wall up. They lost in a mere two quarters defensive coordinator, Jim Eddie went from being called the defensive coordinator of the year and the man first in line to be a high a head coach next year to a man without a job in the NFL. You ever choked? Nobody has ever choked. I have been talking about fumbling the goal line, second foot in your mouth. Once you got to the microphone, had a brain freeze on the exam that you were totally prepared for. Forgot the punchline to a joke in front of 40,000 graduating students at the University of Houston commencement, or maybe you've had that feeling of, oh my God, life just cannot get any better than this moment and ask yourself, do I deserve this? Now what happens when we get that feeling tense up? We have this sort of outer body experience where we are literally three seeing ourself in the third person and we realized that the moment just got bigger than us. They were felt that way, I have,

Speaker 1:          25:35          and it's because we have created a fictitious ceiling, a roof to our expectations of ourselves, a limit where we think it's all too good to be true, but it's not, and it's not our right to say or believe it is. We shouldn't create these restrictions on ourselves. Blue ribbon a statue, a score, a great idea. The love of our life are euphoric. Bliss. Who are we? The thing that we don't deserve or haven't earned these gifts. When we get them, it's not all right,

Speaker 1:          26:14          but if we stay in process within ourselves, in the joy of the doing, we will never choke at the finish line. Why? Because we are thinking of the finish line because we're not looking at the clock. We're not watching ourselves on the Jumbotron, performing the very act that we're in the middle of. No, we're in process. The approach is the destination and we're never finished. Bo Jackson, what did do? He used to run over the goal line through the endzone end of the tunnel, the greatest snipers and marksman in the world. They don't aim at the target. They aim on the other side of the target. We do our best when our destinations are beyond the measurement, when our reach continually exceeds our grasp and when we have a more tool finish lines, and when we do this, the race is never over. The journey has no port adventure never ends because we are always on the way, so do this, do this, and let them let somebody else come up and tap you on the shoulder and say, hey, you scored. Let them run up and tap you on the show and say, man, you want let them come tell you you can go home. Now let them say I love you too.

Speaker 1:          27:35          Let them say thank you. Take the lid off. The manmade roofs that we put above ourselves and always play like an underdog. It would go number 11, turn the page, the late and Great University of Texas football coach Darryl Royal. Y'All remember when we won a national champion in [inaudible], 69. He won a couple of national championships and it'll Darwalla. He was a friend of mine, a good friend of many people. Now, a lot of people looked up to this man.

Speaker 1:          28:10          One of the people looked up to him was a musician named Larry. Now at this time in his life, Larry was in the prime of his country music career. He had number one hits and his life was rolling and he had picked up a bad habit of a snort and the white stuff somewhere along the line and at one particular party after a bathroom break, Larry went confidently up to his mentor, Darryl, and he started telling the story, Oh troy, listen, as he always had, and when Larry finished his story and was about to walk away, coach royal put a gentle hand on his shoulder and he very discretely said, hey larry, you got something on your on your nose there. But Larry immediately hurried to the bathroom mirror where he saw some of the white powder that he hadn't cleaned up his nose. He was ashamed.

Speaker 1:          29:00          He was embarrassed as much because he felt so disrespectful to coach royal and as much because he'd obviously gotten too comfortable with the drug, even hide it as well as he should. Well, the next day Larry went to coach's house, he rang the doorbell coach answered, and he said, coach, I need to talk to you. Dale said, sure. Come on. In, Larry confessed. He purged his sins to coach. He told him how embarrassed he was and how he had lost his way in the midst of all this fame and fortune, and towards the end of an hour, Larry, who was in tears, he asked coach. He said, coach, what do you. What do you think I should do? I coach being a man of few words, just looked at him and hey, call me. Said,

Speaker 2:          29:47          Larry,

Speaker 1:          29:49          I have never had any trouble turning the page in the book of my life. Larry got sober that day and he's been sober for the last 40 years. You ever get in a Rut? I'm talking about you. Get the funk stuck on the merry. Go around. Have a bad habit I have,

Speaker 2:          30:12          but

Speaker 1:          30:13          we're going to make mistakes. You've got to own them. Then you got to make amends and then you gotta move on. Guilt and regret kills many. Amanda, who their time, so turn the page, get off the ride. You are the author of the book of Your Life. Turn that page. Number 12, give your obstacles credit. You know those, um, no fear. Tee shirts that were out, I don't know, he used to wear them 10 years ago. No fear may remember. Those are just me. I saw them everywhere.

Speaker 2:          30:51          All right.

Speaker 1:          30:54          I don't get them and I never did. I mean I tried to scare myself at least once a day. I mean, I get butterflies every morning before I go to work. I was nervous before I got here to speak tonight. I think fear is a good thing now. Why? Because it increases our need to overcome that fear, right? So say your obstacle is fear of rejection. Now you want to ask her out or you want to ask him out, but you feared that he or she may say no to you. You want to ask your boss for that promotion, but you're scared. He's going to think you're overstepping your bounds. Well, instead of denying those fears, declare them. Say the fear out loud, admitted. Give them the credit they deserve. Don't get all macho and act like they're no big deal and don't get paralyzed by denying that they exist and therefore abandoning your need to overcome them. I mean, I even subscribe to the belief that we're all destined to have to do the thing that we fear the most anyway at some point. So give your obstacles credit and you will one, find the courage to overcome them or you will to see more clearly that they're not really worth prevailing over.

Speaker 1:          32:09          So be brave. Have courage. And when you do, you get stronger. You get more aware, you get more respectful of yourself and that which you fear.

Speaker 1:          32:22          Number 13. So how do we know when we crossed the truth? 13th and was asking why did I picked 13? That's an unlucky member. Well, I don't know. When 13 got the bad rap and became the world numerology, it's never done me wrong. 13, in fact, 13 has been a pretty lucky number for me. And I want to tell you how I've always taken these 21 day trips by myself to far off places where I usually don't know the language and nobody knows my name, their adventures one, but they're also a purge their cleanse for me, they're like a 21 day fast from tension from all the things I have in my well appointed life. There are check out so I can check in with me, see how I'm doing. He forced to be my own and my only company to have a look in my mirror.

Speaker 1:          33:20          And we all know what can happen when we do that. Sometimes we do not like what we see. Well, in 1996, uh, right after I got famous from a film I did couple of time to kill. I, uh, I headed out on one of these 21 day walk about and this time to the jungles in the mountains of Peru. The sudden fame that I just gotten was somewhat. I'm on balancing. My face was everywhere. Everyone wanted a piece of me. People I'd never met were swearing that they loved me everywhere I went there. I was on a billboard of magazine cover. It was, it was just weird overall, you know, as I was asking myself, what's the reality in this and what's the bullshit? Did I deserve all this? These are all questions I was asking myself who was I was another. Now there's always an initiation period with these trip, an amount of time that it takes for the place to initiate the traveler, the time it takes to disconnect from the world.

Speaker 1:          34:20          We just left and become completely present in the one we are traveling in now. For me, that initiation period, use the last about 13 days, 13 hellish days until I'm out of my own way. Well, it was the night of the Twelfth Day. My 21 day trip I'm settling into camp, had already hiked 80 miles to this point and I had a three day trek atomy to Machu Picchu and I was full on sick of myself. Wrestling with the loss of anonymity. I was guilt ridden for the sins of my past. Had a lot of grit. I was lonely, disgusted with my company, mine grappling with these demons on this night. I couldn't sleep all of these badges and banners and expectations and anxieties that I was carrying with me. I needed to free myself from them, so I stripped down to nothing. I. I took every moniker that gave me pride and confidence, all the window dressings, the packaging around the product.

Speaker 1:          35:19          I discard them all. I got rid of my lucky and faithful American cap. I stripped off all my talismans from adventures past. I even discarded my late father's gold ring with an m on it that he gave to me and it was. It was a meltdown of he and my mom's classrooms and gold from mom's teeth. Even got rid of that. I was naked, literally and figuratively, and I got sick, felt clean. I felt free and light long, a muddy path on this walk. I, I turned a corner and they're in the middle of the road. Was was this Mirage. It's magnificent. Pinks and blues and red colors that I'd ever seen it. It was electric, glowing and vibrant. Just hovering just off the surface of the jungle floor as if it was plugged into some neon powerplant. I stopped. I stared. There was no way around it.

Speaker 1:          36:18          The jungle floor in front of me was actually thousands of butterflies there in my path. It was spectacular, so I stayed a in somewhere in my captivation I heard this little voice inside my head. Say these words, all I want is what I can see and all I can see is what's in front of me. Now, at that moment have I had stopped anticipating what was around the corner for the first time, I stopped thinking about what was coming up next, what was up ahead. Time slowed down. I was no longer in a rush to get anywhere and my anxieties were greatly ease. Few hours later, I returned to camp. Even the local Sherpas I was traveling with, they they noticed calling out to me, so he's losing Mateo so he's lose, which means you are light in Spanish. The I forgave myself. That morning I let go of the guilt, the wait, it was on.

Speaker 1:          37:22          My shoulders was lifted, my penance was paid, and I got back in good graces with my God and I shook hands with myself, my best friend, the one that we're all stuck with anyway, ourselves and from that morning on the adventure was awesome. I was president. I was out of my own way. I was not anticipating next. I was embracing only what was in front of my eyes and giving everything that justice that he deserved. See, I crossed the truth that morning. Now did I find it? I don't know. I think it found me. Why? Because I put myself in a place to be found. I put myself in a place to receive the truth. So how do we know when we crossed the truth? Well, I think the truth is all around us all the time. I mean, I think the answer, you know, it's always right there or right there.

Speaker 1:          38:09          I think it's all around us. We just don't always see it. We don't always grasp it here. It access it usually because we're not in the right place to do so. So what do we do first? I believe we've got to put ourselves in the place to receive the truth. Let's do it. We live in an extremely noisy world with all kinds of frequencies coming at us. We've got commitments. We got deadlines, fix this, do that. Plans, expectations, and they all make it hard to get clarity and peace of mind, so we have to consciously put ourselves in places to receive that clarity. Now that may be prayer, that may be meditation, that may be a walkabout, that may be being in the right company, a road trip, whatever it is for you. Schedule that time, schedule it so we do that. If we hear it, we've put ourselves in a place to hear it and we do, and it's become clear, a truth, natural and infinite.

Speaker 1:          39:05          Then the second part comes, which is to personalize it. Ask yourself how it works for you, how it applies to you personally, why you need it in your life specifically, and if you do that, then comes the third part. Had the patience to internalize it and get it from our intellectual head. Thinking about it and into our bones and our soul. And our instinct now, we cannot rush this part. It does take time. So if we get that far, we've received it, we personalize it and internalize it. If we make it, that got to have the courage to act on it, they actually take it into our daily lives and practice it to make it an active part of who we are and live it and do that. Right? If we do that, then we have what I believe is heaven right here on earth.

Speaker 1:          39:58          I mean, that's the ticket in it. Think about it. I know that's where I want to live while we're here and they're going to run across the jumbo tron. Let's make it a place where we break a sweat where we believe, where we enjoyed the process of succeeding in the places, in ways that we're fashion to where we don't have to look over our shoulder because we're too busy doing what we're good at voluntarily keeping our own council because we want to traveling towards immortal finish lines. We write our own book, overcoming our fears. We make friends with ourselves and Matt Place and I'm talking about.
