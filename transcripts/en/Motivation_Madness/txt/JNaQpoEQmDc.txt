Speaker 1:          00:14          Why not? Now? This is a good time. As the 20th century starts to wind down a few more years as we get ready for century 21, what a good time to set your goals, work on yourself, work on your skills. What a good time to get it together? What a good time to start this process, personal development, growing, changing, developing, having a good plan for your money and for your life and for your future. Why not was

Speaker 2:          00:51          no opportunity is wasted. Listen to me carefully. God, let's do me very carefully. You got to hear what I'm saying. This is important. They're 86,000, 400 seconds in a day and if you maximize each and every one of them, you will live like you want to live. You will have what you want to have and you will be what you want to be.

Speaker 1:          01:12          You can have more than you've got because you can become more than you are. If you just remain how you are, you'll always have what you've got, but if you're willing to make changes, the next five years of your life can be totally different than the last one. If you don't change, chances are excellent. The next five will be like the last fall. For things to change, you've got to change for things to get better. It's not what happens that determines your future. It's what you do about what happens. Direction determines destination. All you got to do is make a little change in direction to arrive at a brand new destination in two years, three years, five years,

Speaker 2:          02:02          user have to change your life. That is. She kind of said, you know what? My body is on there. I'm going to go work out. My relationship isn't there. I'm going to change it. I'm not making what are going to make. I'm going to retool. I'm going to get a new skill. I'm going to go back to school. I'm going to start a business. I'm going to do something. You have to do something to change your life or in order for you to be happy. You can't change your life. You're going to have to change your blueprint. Usually in life. It requires a little bit of beach. Does that make sense? And if you've changed your take, change your life and change your blueprint. You can have an extraordinary life because all of us are going to have times in our life when we want or think life should be like, isn't gonna match how life really is? Those moments? If we blame our life goes into pain. If we change, we can change our life and match our blueprint. The fact that you're not happy has nothing to do with what you have or don't have. The fact that you're an unhappy is that your life doesn't match the way you think it should be. You have some idea of how you think it should be.

Speaker 2:          03:06          Listen to me. There are. Those of you are. What you're doing is that they're are 10 opportunities in a day and you're taking advantage of it. If you think you're doing something right. Yeah, you gotta hear me, you gotta hear me. You only have 24 hours in a day, and you've heard me say this time and time again, the way you spend your 24 hours, it determines how you live.

Speaker 1:          03:28          If you want the future to change for you, you've got to change. If you don't change, the next six years of your life is going to be just like the last six. You'll still be behind on your bills. You'll still be behind on your promises.

Speaker 2:          03:43          No opportunity wasted. Again, no opportunity wasted.

Speaker 1:          03:50          If one of us can do it, hey, we all can do it. Now, here's my last question. Why not? Now

Speaker 3:          04:01          we all have this negative self talk that goes in our head. Guess what? There's enough people that are telling us we can't do it, that we're not good enough. Why do we want to tell ourselves that we know for fact that thoughts influence actions. We sat there with the, um, with the video sheldon, Dr Levy, so right. We know that our thoughts influence actions. Why do we want to see that negative self talk to ourselves? We need to get our own self-affirmation. Muhammad Ali, what was his self affirmation? I am the greatest. Who else is going to tell you you need to be quiet moments in your bedroom, quiet moments when you're brushing your teeth that we need to reaffirm, I am the captain of my ship and the master of my fate. That is my affirmation and looking forward to a time that I would feel good again, helped me to keep moving forward and sometimes I had to be brave and it wasn't always easy.

Speaker 3:          05:03          Sometimes I faltered, I had bad days, but I realized that being brave is supposed to be easy. And for me, I feel it's the key way to keep moving forward. So all at all, I don't waste energy feeling bad for myself. Uh, I surround myself with people that I want to be with and I keep moving forward. So with this philosophy, I hope that all of you, regardless of your obstacles, can have a very happy life as well. Shit, if I don't see it, if I don't believe you that no one else will get the people. There's enough of that Mohammed Ali. I am the greatest. There is no one better than me. It's a difference between Hubris and ego and false pride.

Speaker 4:          05:58          It's just reminding yourself and quiet silent moments. I put it down on the list. It's right beside my mirror

Speaker 5:          06:10          in Russia and Japan ever met in, made in America the whole world, but better than all of those before. Thank you.

Speaker 6:          06:44          I'm not gonna argue with you. You're going to be just like some of your already there. Well, you don't know how you're going to make this happen, but you just feel within yourself some way somehow with the help of God, I'm going to make it happen. Repeat after me please. No matter how bad it is, oh, how bad it gets. I'm going to make it. I'm going to make it shake someone's hand on your right and left and say you got the right stuff. So yes, it's possible for you to live your dream because it's not about where you come from. It's about. That's number one. Number two. Number two, I want to make sure you got it. Isn't as though the important thing is this right? Mom said, listen to me. The most important thing is to be able to sacrifice what for what alligator. Adam handcuff lightening undone jail. Last week I'm murdering Angelo stone. Hospitalized the brick eric.

Speaker 7:          08:36          I'm so mean. I make medicine sick fast, fast, fast. Last night I cut the light off in my bedroom. Get switched. Was in the band for the room. Was dog better fast? You George Foreman. Oh, you chumps bow. When I whip him. Oh, I know you got him. I know you got him picked, but the man's in tomorrow. I'm going to show you how great I am.

Speaker 8:          09:02          A lot of people tried to talk her side of it. A lot of people didn't understand it by the people weren't ready for it. Ready for it, but I want to remind you mind to continue to dream and dream big. Dream big.

Speaker 6:          09:31          They didn't call my name.

Speaker 8:          09:36          Go for you to live life with regrets. I want you to remember this. Every time you walk in the room with anybody, anybody, right know that you're special. No that you mean something to this world.

Speaker 6:          10:03          I don't care what you started at. I don't care who told you what you couldn't. I believe I don't care if nobody liked your status, family members turning back on negative. People want to keep coming to your life. There's a bigger dream waiting for you, waiting for you to step into it, a bit to it, to step into it. Your life is big. Your life is huge, huge, and we spend so much time wanting to be in somebody else's life.

Speaker 9:          11:16          When I was young, I had a lot of people telling me, you have to adjust to the other ones, the other ones, you have to be like the other ones. I was listening, but I wasn't always following. I dragged it in. How do you say I was listening, but I did my own thing, my own thing. I kept doing my own thing and I believed in myself. I kept going and it brought me where I am today. Confidence in believing what you do.

Speaker 6:          11:47          I think that is the goal. Target

Speaker 8:          11:50          have to be relentless.

Speaker 6:          11:53          You have to never let off the gas. Gas, never stop, never quit. Never allow anyone to talk you out of the dream division and ideas that God has sent you. It doesn't matter how many times you get knocked down. It's about getting back up, so if there's any kid out there that's told by a parent or a coach or a teacher or somebody that they look up to, somebody that's supposed to push them and believe in them and they're told, no, don't listen to them. Believe in yourself. Sometimes the outcome isn't always what you desire it to be, but the true failure in life is not trying at all and the master no

Speaker 10:         12:46          get in line just because other people are. I'm only talking to the people that are ready to get to the next level of a life in their career and they're going to boldly walk into the next season of their life. Unapologetically getting rid of all things people in situations that no longer belong in their life. Most of you, most of you, you're so consumed with everything that's going on in the world. This is the reason you haven't figured out your own life yet. Every blog, every website, every tweet, every instagram post, you are so consumed with everything that's going on in the world. You're ignoring your own world. You can never shine trying to sit on someone else's son. You can never figure out who you are if you're consumed in everything that everybody else is and what they're doing in the moves that they're making because you're trying to chase someone else's life trying to chase someone else's lifestyle and identity all while ignoring your own life and your own path. What is the vision for your life? What are the ideas and the dreams for your life? What are you supposed to be doing? Who are you? What are your gifts and talents? What is your ultimate destiny and your goals

Speaker 10:         14:31          and you should understand this, that it was always going to be your family and your friends. That would be the first ones to try and talk you out of your vision and your big idea. That's why you supposed to live your life, focused on your intentions and do your thing.

Speaker 5:          14:50          Did you allow yourself

Speaker 10:         14:52          to be based on what other people think of you? Is the beginning of the end, I believe in me. If you stopped believing in me, I'm not going to believe in myself any less. If you believe that I'm irrelevant, that no one is checking for me and that I don't mean anything to the world because you think or believe that about me, it doesn't mean that I'm going to believe it about myself. See, the day that you start living your life according to everybody else's opinion is the beginning of the hand. Most of you guys don't actually know your self worth. You don't know yourself. Value, believe in yourself. Believe in yourself, independent of the validation of the world. I have opinions and feelings about yourself, independent of the feedback.

Speaker 5:          15:58          I really think,

Speaker 10:         16:01          and if you get rid of the trash in your life, that can be people, business and situations. Youtube couldn't really like. I really believe that you can reach your full potential. I want you to fly. I want you in your career and your financial blessings to bypass me.

Speaker 5:          16:40          When I was a kid, I can go through, um, a math book in a week. So I'm going to have chocolate Ganache, stockbroker, stop focusing, not an astronaut,

Speaker 6:          17:12          but I listened to what Jim Bob on will say at 21 years, the most poignant seven words ever uttered in any speech anywhere. Don't give up. Don't ever give up. Those great people didn't. So I now have a responsibility to also not ever give up. I'm not special. I just listened to what the man said,

Speaker 6:          17:44          but I'd say there is some times in life where you fall down, feel like, like you don't have the strength to get back on. I will try 100 times to get up and if I fail 100 times, if I fail and I give up, do you think that I'm ever going to get up and fail and try again and again and again. For as long as I'm trying to getting up, don't quit. The secret is not keeping up. Everybody who's done something great, they weren't that deep resiliency. They have the ability to bounce back all the way. Just stay on course. I guarantee you cannot pass it. If you quit. I guarantee you, you don't know what's going to happen. If you keep going,

Speaker 6:          18:42          I'm prejudiced, I feel pain. I heard I opened my eyes. A great victory. Do not give up. I feel no fear. I fear no man. I create. Conquer that. Hold the power. Make a choice. Just decide what is going to be, who you're going to be, how you're going to do it. Just decide and then from that point the universe is going to get out your way. We can have another bad year. You got to get to the point where enough is enough. It's much easier to come up with excuses why you can't do it. If you do what is easy, your life will be hard. If you do want to say is complain about your situation and circumstances, surrender and give up on your dreams. Become depressed and bitter and angry. Anybody can do that. If you do what is easy, your life will be hard, would have you do what is Paul? Keep coming back again and again and again. Get up dressed every day. Take life, taking life by the column. You say, yes, I can do this, and you've said to yourself, I'm willing to face the nose. I'm willing, I'm willing to. I'm willing to make this happen. It's, it's possible. It's necessary. It's hard. It's worth it to do whatever it takes. I can do it. If anybody has ever done at any point in time in history than what's possible for one, it's possible for me and I'm going to deal with, and if you do that and over

Speaker 3:          20:47          and over again, your life will be easy. I want you to stop gathering information from outside yourself. Start gathering the inside. He made a mistake and he paid for his mistake with a lot of pain, a lot of tears, and there came to a point where he knew he should've gotten a divorce, but he was stuck. He was stuck in something called revenge. He said, she's made me so miserable. I'm gonna. Pay Her back. He was stuck and he stayed in there longer than he should have because it began to us. Attack him. It began to affect them psychologically.

Speaker 5:          21:42          Mm.

Speaker 3:          21:49          He took that same attitude to other relationships. Looking for something to go wrong, he was burned so badly, he did not want to risk pain again. He was going in relationships, trying to avoid pain when it became too, cause he will do something to make sure the relationship did not work. He would always try and find something wrong with it.

Speaker 2:          22:08          The person, because they're not perfect people, so if you look forward, you can find it. He was stuck in revenge. Is it difficult? Sure isn't anything that's worthy of character building. Sometimes I have to forgive the same people over and over and over again. However, forgiveness is a practice worth cultivating, worth experiencing. When you forgive somebody for something that you perceived that they've done wrong to you, you are releasing that animosity, that energy, that ill will, that you're harboring inside, and it's a lot more difficult than just merely saying, I'm sorry,

Speaker 2:          22:51          how did I get depressed to who I am today? Because I tell you I was depressed when I was age eight. I used to concentrate on the things I didn't have. I wish I had arms, legs and I wish I could do this, but what can I do? You see? I have a choice and that's what I want to talk about today. Choices, I can either be angry for not having arms and legs will be thankful for my chicken. Drumstick, you see, I can still do a lot of things at home. I can brush my teeth, comb my hair, get myself ready in the morning. I'm traveling around the world. It's amazing.

Speaker 11:         23:26          It's a choice. That is what I want to live. My life can't always be happy. Listen, I know I'm not crazy. I realized the realism in always been happy. Sometimes you have to put up with crap in your life, but if we're always striving to choose happiness everyday you wake up and you say to yourself, I'm going to choose to not let the outside influences in the world affect my mood. I'm going to be in charge of how I feel because I am a choose happiness. I promise you, you will leave a lot happier life. At least. At least you can try to write. You just have to set the necessary conditions for health necessity, incentives for health, both for yourself and your children. If you have that set incentives for sickness,

Speaker 11:         24:19          I felt depressed, I felt miserable. I felt at times where it may be better to take my life, but with the wisdom that I gathered in my 33 short years of life, I've come to realize that it's just feeling and in the same way that chameleon cold is diminished. The misery of feeling cold is diminished by the insight that spring will come is the same feeling that you should acknowledge the same law, that you should have knowledge that no matter how miserable things are right now, it is just a season. It's going to pass the thing that keeps one living, his sense of future, that there will be a tomorrow, tomorrow to do this, and then the day after I got to do that. Not that any of these things tick and convincing reason to exist, they somehow keep one going in. In the words of Dorothy Parker, great job, which you might as well live.
