Speaker 1:          00:08          Did you hear what the cow said to the farmer on a cold winter morning? Thanks for the warm hand anyway. It's going to get better, so don't panic on the start. Small. Nice to see all of you. How many of you have never seen me before? Is this your first time? Oh Wow. Most of you. Okay. I keep thinking for sure. I'm more famous than that, but uh, you know, that is the truth. I'm delighted to be here and looking forward to it for a long time and it's nice to be back. You know, I was here not too long ago. It's nice to be invited back. It says something when you're invited back. It doesn't say everything but says something. Maybe it says, let's give him one more chance. Right? See if he can get it right this time. But I'm delighted to have all of you here.

Speaker 1:          00:58          We're going to spend the day together. I feel two major responsibilities and I'm sure you can guess what those are. Number one is to make sure you get your money's worth right when you shallow out your cash, basically these days you want to make sure you get full value for the money you spent, and I know the tab for the seminar was not that much. Pretty modest fee to get in most of you, your tips for the week, right? So it wasn't that much, but I want you to be able to say, when you walk out of here today, it was worth my money, but my biggest responsibility is to make sure you get your time's worth. And the reason I say that is because time is more valuable than money. In fact, you might start your notes with that. Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but unfortunately you can't get more time.

Speaker 1:          01:50          If somebody asked you to spend your money, that's pretty easy, right? We live in America were wealthy, so the money's not the problem, but what if somebody asks you to spend the day? Right? You got to think that over carefully, and I know you did. I wouldn't waste one of my days and not for anybody, not for anything. Once I understood how valuable they were, I don't waste any, but to make an investment like today of your money and your time, I appreciate it. That today is going to be constantly for me. It's going to cost me one of my days to be here and some money of course, but no, I don't need the money. I take the money, but I don't. I don't need the money, but guess what? I do need the time. So I'm here not to just joke with you on here, not to just tell some funny stories and give a performance and walk away.

Speaker 1:          02:40          I'm here to give you some value and I want to make it worth your time. I'm going to invest a day. You're going to invest today. Let's get the most out of it and see what we can walk away with today. Anyway, for you that have not seen me before. Just very briefly, let me just tell you my story. I grew up in Idaho farm country, southwest corner of Idaho. In fact, my father still lives on the old homestead where I grew up. He'll be 89. His next birthday still hasn't retired. I'm proud of. My Dad has never been ill. He's really something. I'm trying to get him to retire this year. 80 eight. I'm telling my father, what a good year to retire when you're 88. And he says, Hey, talk to me in 10 years. Right. I might be ready. But anyway, I went to high school.

Speaker 1:          03:30          I graduated, I went to college one year. Halfway through my second year of college I decided I was smart enough. So I quit. One of my major mistakes. I should've stayed in school. Uh, but I thought, yeah, you know, I'm smart enough to get a job. That's what life's all about, right? Get a job, pay your bills, were card and stay out of trouble. Keep your fingers crossed and hope for the best. And I figured I was at least prepared to do that. So I quit college and went to work. Then a while later, got married, got my little family going, and I'm out there doing what I thought was the best I could, but at about age 25, I'm starting to struggle. I've purchased a little more than I can conveniently pay for on time and the creditors are starting to call saying, hey, you told us the check was in the mail.

Speaker 1:          04:20          What's the deal? And I'm getting embarrassed by that. I'm also embarrassed, big mouth me with all the fancy promises I made to get married. I'm way behind on those promises and I'm getting discouraged or wondering what to do. And I thought, well maybe I should go back to school, right? One Year of college. Pretty short on an application. But uh, you know, tough to go back to school, right. Especially when you got your family going. Time to stay is when you're there. Uh, so I discounted that. I thought, well, if I had my own business, that would be the way to go. But you know, I'm short on money too much month at the end of the money you've ever been there. That's where I was age 25. So I had to discount that and I'm discouraged wondering where do I go from here? And then the miracle happened for me.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Good fortune came my way, and who can explain good fortune? I don't know, remarkable things that happened to you at a particular time. Sometimes it's just unexplainable how those things happened. One of my friends says, well, hey, things don't just happen. Things happen. Just another good note for your notes. Things don't just happen. Things happen. Just. And maybe that's it. I don't know. I'm an amateur on life, I guess like most of us are trying to figure it out, how to make it valuable. But I was ready and my good fortune was at age 25. I met a very wealthy man. His name was Mr Shoaff, Mr Earl show. A friend of mine had gone to work for him and he started telling me about this man. He said, you got to meet this man I've gone to work for. He's wealthy, but he's easy to talk to a and he's got a unique philosophy of life.

Speaker 1:          06:08          And the more he kept talking about this man, I thought, well, I've got to meet this man. So sure enough, shortly after that I had a chance to meet this remarkable wealthy man. And I was impressed. He was wealthy. Sure enough, he was easy to talk to. I was so intrigued. Within a few minutes, I said to myself, if I could be like him, farm boy from Idaho, I could be like him. I'd give anything. And then I thought if I could just get around somebody like him and if he would teach me what to do, I would be willing to learn. I'm coachable. And that was my good fortune. A few months later, this wealthy man that I met, Mr Joe took a liking to me, hired me, gave me a job. I went to work for him and I spent the next five years in his employer. And then unfortunately he died at the end of that period at age 49 his last five years.

Speaker 1:          07:03          But the first five years of my new life, I got to spend with this remarkable man. And my dream came true. He coached me and taught me. He taught me the books to read. He taught me the discipline. He taught me the changes to make in my language and personality and the things he shared with me during that five years, literally changed my life, turned my life around, change my income, changed my bank account. That changed my future, changed everything. I've never been the same since that unique experience and I wish he was still alive today. Mr. Show, I'm sure if he was alive today, especially after this seminar, Idaho farm boy and mix it to Dallas, fort worth, full house, standing room only. Pretty awesome. I'm sure he was alive. I'd be calling him today saying, you won't believe what's happening to me. I've had a chance now to share with other people what you shared with me, but anyway, how I got here 30 plus years ago.

Speaker 1:          08:00          I was living in Beverly Hills, California and one day a friend of mine, businessmen friend said, Jim, would you, I'd like to have you come and share your story with my service club that I belong to the Rotary Club. He said, I know your story. Idaho farm boy and makes it to beverly hills, but he said, I think my club members would love to hear your story. He said, if I arranged one of our breakfast meetings, would you come and tell your story? Just share a few thoughts. And I said, okay, uh, so I agreed to go give this breakfast talk and guess what? They liked it. And my telephone rang. I got another call. I've got another call saying we heard a. you've given your story and shared some ideas. Would you come talk to our club? Tough dark club? First thing I know I'm starting to devote a piece of my business time to giving these talks.

Speaker 1:          08:49          And then one day a businessman who had heard my talk, I think two or three times approached me and said, would you come and share that story and some thoughts with my management and sales? And I got this little company going and he said, if you'd come and tell your story to my organization, he said I'd be happy to pay. And I thought, wow, wouldn't that be something? So I agreed to go do it and I got paid. Little did I know another fortune was waiting for me to translate my ideas into talks and speeches and seminars. Now I've written some books. It's on cassette tape now I get to travel around the world. Last year I was in Japan is real Spain, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Canada, and now Dallas, fort worth, Idaho farm boy gets to travel around the world and sharing dory and here I am today.

Speaker 1:          09:50          Anyway. It's almost too much for me to comprehend from where I started, raised in obscurity, a little small farm community and now to be here. Today's pretty awesome for me. So anyway, that's just a little bit about my story. My story is probably more intriguing for me than it is for you, but I wanted to hear it again. So I thought I would just bore you with it anyway. I don't ask you to be impressed today. I'm the one that's impressed from where I came from to have a chance, but that's the American dream, right? Come true. Chance to start from scratch. Start from obscurity. Start with pennies. Start with nothing and have a chance to transform your life, change your life, set your goals, and see what you can accomplish. So anyway, that's how I got here and I'm just delighted that this day has arrived and I truly want to make it valuable for you. Let's go to work. Here's what I hope you'll find out of this seminar today for your notes. Here's what I hope you'll find. Number one, sincerity above all else today. I hope you will find me sincere, best place for people to start to communicate his sincerity on both sides. I'm sure you're sincere or you wouldn't be here today, right? To spend this kind of money, to spend this kind of time. Roll up your sleeves today, go to work like I am, and get this message. You've got to be sincere, so I assume you're sincere. Now, I want you to see me sincere, but I've got a good note for you to make. Sincerity is not a test of truth. Important note, to make sincerity is not a test

Speaker 2:          11:25          truth.

Speaker 1:          11:29          We must not make the mistake of saying he must be right. He's so sincere. That would be a mistake, and here's why it's possible to be sincerely wrong, so we don't mistake sincerity for truth, right? Sincerity is only a test of sincerity. Truth has to yet be tested by truth. Okay, but hopefully you will find

Speaker 3:          11:54          me sincere and truthful. Next, a combination of things I hope you'll find here today. Ideas plus inspiration, ideas, plus inspiration

Speaker 3:          12:08          ideas, business ideas, and social ideas and personal ideas. We all need ideas, right? How to have a good day, ideas, how to have a good year, ideas, how to have your best year ever. Ideas, good health ideas, personal relationship ideas, how to deal with your family ideas, sales management ideas, financial freedom for the future ideas. We all need good ideas. So today I hope you gather up by notes and by what you can remember. A lot of ideas. I want to share as many with you as I possibly can and the time constraints we have today is going to go very rapidly. I used to think a day like this was a long day. Found out it's pretty short day, but I'm going to go as fast as I can, share with you as many ideas as I possibly can and here's why. Ideas can be life changing. Ideas can be life changing and sometimes all you need is just one more in a series of good ideas.

Speaker 3:          13:06          It's like dialing the numbers into the lock, right? You got five or six numbers dialed into the lock. The lock still won't come open, but you don't need five or six more numbers. Maybe you just need one more and maybe a seminar like this could do. A sermon, could do it. The lyric from a song could do it. The dialogue from a movie, you could do it conversation with a friend might do it. That one last piece, you need number, dial it into the lock. That's it. The lock comes open. There's the door for you to walk through and maybe this seminar today could furnish that for you. One more idea. I know you've come with a lot already. Sometimes we get the impression I used to have that, but I only had this much going for me and I needed this much, usually not true, and I'm sure not true of this audience.

Speaker 3:          13:51          Where do I find you today as well dressed as you look today. You know, it's fine as you are sitting here today. It isn't that you know you've got this much going for you and you need this much. I would assume you've got this much going for you and maybe all you need is just a few more thoughts, ideas, uh, to furnish Houston ways and means to turn your life into the dream you want it to be. So ideas. The seminar is going to be loaded with ideas. I want you to take good notes, but here's what else I hope you'll find here today, and that is inspiration

Speaker 3:          14:23          and who knows the mystery of inspiration, why some people are inspired and some are not. You weren't inspired to get here, some were not. Who knows the mystery of that? I don't know. How come you made it. The rest of them didn't make it. We don't know what that mystery is. Some people turned it down, some people said it costs too much. Some people say it's going to take too much time. Some people are too busy, right? A lot of different excuses why some are inspired to take advantage of something that comes to town and pass it up. We don't know the mystery to that. Here's what I call it, mysteries of the mind, and I just leave it at that. Some things I don't try to figure out. I take the simple approach now, right? Some people do and some people don't. I mean that's about as profound as my philosophy is.

Speaker 3:          15:07          Some buyers and some don't buy something go forward and some don't. Some change and some don't. And if you've been around for awhile, you can usually work out the numbers right out of 10, you know, three do $7, whatever business you're involved in, pretty soon you've got this ratio going. The ones that do the ones that don't, you say, well, why don't the ones that don't, how come they don't? We don't know. I just leave it as a mystery. I used to try to understand all that. I just take the simple approach. Now the guy says, this happens to me. This happened to me. This goes wrong for me, and all this stuff goes wrong for me. How come all this stuff happens to me? I say, I don't know. Beats me. The Best I've been able to figure it out is those kinds of things always happen to people like you.

Speaker 3:          15:51          I mean, that's the best I got. I don't know. I'm an amateur on this stuff. What do I know? So just take the simple approach, right? That's how it is. Who knows? Interesting story says the day the Christian church was started. Now I'm an amateur on the Bible, but best account I can remember the day the Christian church was started, a magnificent sermon was preached, great presentation, and if you're a student of all at all, have good communication. It was one of the classic presentations of all times the sermon. The first day the Christian church was started and it said the sermon. This presentation was given to a multitude, meaning a lot of people, but it was interesting as the account gives us the record, it says when the sermon was finished, there was a variety of reaction to the same server. Isn't that fascinating?

Speaker 3:          16:46          I find it fascinating. It said some that heard this presentation were perplexed and I read the presentation sounded pretty straightforward to me. He said, why would somebody be perplexed with a good, sincere, straightforward presentation? Best Answer I've got. They are the perplexed. What other explanation is that? It doesn't matter who's preaching. It said some that heard this presentation mocked and laughed, made fun of the presentation. I thought, Hey, this looks pretty sincere to me. If you give a sincere, honest presentation, why would somebody mock and laugh? Easy explanation. They are the mockers and the laughers. What else would you expect them to do? I used to try to straighten all that out. Say, well, they shouldn't do that. I don't do that anymore. I've got peace of mind now. I sleep like a baby. Not try to straighten all this stuff out. I used to be so naive. I used to say, well, liars shouldn't lie. See how naive can you be? Of course they're supposed to lie. That's why we call them liars. They lie.

Speaker 3:          17:50          Why don't straighten this stuff out anymore. Anyway, it said some that heard this magnificent presentation didn't know what was going on, and they're usually easy to spot. They're usually saying, what's going on, right? I mean, they don't know what's going on, but interesting, right? A variety of reaction to the same sincere, honest presentation. Now it also says in wrapping it up, some that heard the presentation believed, and I think that's who the speaker was looking for. The believers. Interesting. Now it said the number of believers was about 3000, so pretty good. First Day, 3000. I've had some first days though. I never had 3000, but anyway, 3000 were believers and that's the speaker was looking for the believers out of this multitude and that's about as close as we can come to understanding the mystery. Some believe and some mock and some laugh and some are perplexed and some don't know what's going on and you just have to leave it that way.

Speaker 3:          18:48          Why? Because that's the way it's going to be. The way to be brilliant is to find out how it's going to be and then say, here's how it should be. I mean, that's how you'd be coming. Brilliant. So anyway, who knows the mystery, I call it mysteries of the mind. We don't understand, but I don't try to change it anymore on this particular story. As far as we know, they didn't have classes after the presentation to try to deeper plex the perplexed. I mean as far as we know, they left them for plaques. They left the mockers mocking. They let the laughers laugh. I mean they didn't come back and try to straighten all this out. You say, well, how can you build a church? Well, make another presentation and you'll get some believers and some mockers, some laughers and some who don't know what's going on.

Speaker 3:          19:29          So that's about the best we can do. So. But I'm glad I've got the believers here today. You believed enough to shell out your cash and parked with your time and some of your effort and energy, and I appreciate that, so hopefully you'll find some inspiration here today. All right, to get the most out of today, a couple of more notes. Number one, be thankful. That's a good way to capture the most of a day like this and be thankful for what you already have. That shouldn't be any problem in America. Being thankful. Everything we need is available in America. Everybody wants to come here, right? The last time I was here, that little presentation I gave, everybody wants to come here. America. People haven't plotted and schemed the last 40 years, and if I could just get to Poland and everything, it'd be okay.

Speaker 3:          20:17          No, everybody wants to come to America. Why? Everything's available here on the books. You need all the sermons you need, all the churches you need all the schools you need all the instruction. You need all the inspiration you need, all the capital you need, all the markets you need, all the challenge you need, all the information you need, all the seminars you need. Everything's available here. This is America, so number one, let's be thankful for what we already have. Thanksgiving does. This, opens up the doors, opens up the windows, opens up the channels, thanksgiving for what you already have.

Speaker 3:          20:53          I did a seminar one weekend up at the ranch up at clear lake, got a lodge up there, nice setting, high valley high serenity ranch for the weekend. Friday evening, Saturday, Sunday. People drove in from around California. I got there late Friday afternoon. Everybody had pretty well already gotten there. I couldn't believe the parking lot. Continentals and Eldorados and Mercedes and cadillacs and unbelievable Ferrari. One Rolls Royce. Unbelievable. I walked in the crowd, but like this, sitting there ready for the weekend seminar. My opening remarks were ladies and gentlemen, I think the rest of the world would find it strange that we have all come here this weekend to try to figure out how to do better. I think the rest of the world would say, I don't understand in his Rolls Royce and I got to get to the seminar, find out how to get another one of these rolls royces. Unbelievable. Anyway, let's be thankful. Here's what locks up the doors and the channels to receive more cynicism that locks you away, that prevents you from learning more. Being a cynic about the past and the future of cynic, about the marketplace, cynical about the people, cynical about the institution since cynical about the setup,

Speaker 3:          22:11          cynical about yourself, cynical about your chances. See that locks away all the chance for stuff to flow your way. So good advice. I think today, start off, be thankful. Here's number two. Listen, well, that's gonna be a challenge today. I understand. That

Speaker 3:          22:32          seems like most of you know, our life is still going on outside these four walls, right? Most of our life seems like it's out. Continuing out their family and business associates, market and economy and whatever else is happening in the midst of your life and to Sorta pull your attention from what's going on out there and put it in here for just a few hours. I know is a challenge, but do the best you can. Listen. Well, here's the last one. Take good notes. Be a good student today. Take some good notes. I have not come to entertain you as you can tell by my opening joke, right? I would not make it in Las Vegas so we don't have a dog and pony show today. No entertainment, but I do have some ideas. Take some good notes. Somebody showed me the other day notes that they took about 21 years ago, attending one of my seminars out in Los Angeles.

Speaker 3:          23:26          He said, I still use these notes. I took 21 years ago to help me in my business relationship with my family, so I'd like to have these notes that you take today, become that valuable for you than it would be worth me making the investment to come and spend a portion of my life. My my energy here and I want this investment I'm making here today to pay off, and one of the ways it can pay off for me, it's for you to take good notes and then go away and use whatever makes sense because what I feast on, coming back around as the stories out of this audience today. Sure enough, six weeks from now, six months from now, six years from now, somebody is going to by phone, by letter, by personal contact. Walk up to me and say, the things you shared that day got me thinking and I started making some changes and let me tell you what's happened to my business. Let me tell you what's happened in my sales career. Let me tell you what's happened in my relationship with my family. See that will make it worth it for me, not the money, the return. Something you can't buy with money. If somebody says, thank you for touching my life and taking the time to make the investment, and that's what I'm all about. So if you'll become a good student today, and here's the last note, don't be a follower. Be a student

Speaker 3:          24:40          you'd be happy to know today we haven't come seeking disciples. We've got no movement for you to join. I'm just here to share some of my experiences, good ideas, best I can, but I think that's good advice. Don't be a follower. Be a student, right? Take advice, but not orders. Take information, but don't let somebody order your life. Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion. Excellent note to make. Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion. Not to do what someone else says. Take what someone else says, process it, think about it, ponder it. If it makes you wonder, if it makes you think, then it's valuable. Then when you go take action, make sure that the action is not what somebody told you to do. Make sure the action is the product of your own conclusion.

Speaker 3:          25:33          If you will, follow just a little bit of those simple guidelines. I'm telling you, the learning process can be speedy, swift, powerful. Your learning curve can go up and then applying it to your business, your life, your family conversations, equities of all kinds. You'll find some progress like I did that first five years when I met a teacher willing to share with me, turn my life around progress I couldn't believe happened for me. Okay, let's get started. I want to review. I was here last time and we talked about the five major pieces to the life puzzle

Speaker 3:          26:13          and I just want to review those because it lays such a good foundation for all the rest that I want to share with you today. We've got a lot of subjects to cover so we're going to go rather swiftly. Okay. Put on your mental track shoes here and run with me today because I'm going to deal mostly in concepts. Expect you to, you know, fill in a lot of the details because I got a lot to share. I want to get through it all but let's lay this foundation again of the five major pieces happens to be the title of my latest book, but I think it is so valuable and laying a foundation at some of the things I between ages 25 and 30, the teacher who taught me taught me so well. He dealt in these fundamentals, we call these fundamentals. We call these basics basics for sports, fundamentals, for sports, fundamentals, for your business, fundamentals for the way you deal with your family. A few simple things, few basic things that if you practice everyday can make all the difference in the world. How it works out. I boiled it down to five major pieces to the life puzzle. Let's just review those. Number one is philosophy. Philosophy.

Speaker 3:          27:22          Philosophy is I taught the last time I was here. Philosophy in my personal opinion, is the major determining factor in how your life works out philosophy, the major determining factor in how your life works out philosophy to form our philosophy. You've got to think, got to use your mind to process ideas and this whole process over a lifetime starting way back here when we were children, schools that we've attended, our parents, our experiences, all this stuff that we've processed by the thinking process helps to develop our philosophy and in my opinion, each person's personal philosophy is the major factor in how your life works out. Here's what I called it in that last presentation when I was here. It's called the set of the sail. Each person's personal philosophy is like the set of the sail now, I used to think of was circumstances that ordered my life. If someone would have asked me at age 25, Mr Owen, how come you're not doing well? Pennies in your pocket, creditors calling nothing in the bank behind on your promises to your family. You live in America. Twenty five years old, got a beautiful family. Every reason to do well and things are not going that well for you. What is wrong here? It would not have occurred to me to blame my philosophy.

Speaker 3:          28:47          I mean it would not have occurred to me saying, well, I got this lousy philosophy and that's how come I got pennies in my pocket and nothing in the bank and things aren't working well. That would not have occurred to me. I found it much easier to blame the government. Much easier to blame the tax problem. I used to say taxes are too high. Top tax rate. When I first started paying taxes, 91 percent

Speaker 3:          29:12          back then when your income reached a certain level, all your income over that 91 percent, so I have to say that's too high. Now, the tax top tax rates about 33 percent, but people are still saying what taxes are to see, but you can't use that anymore. If it's gone from 91 to 33, how could it be? Do. Hi, come on. I threw all that old excuse stuff away. Some people found it though and they're using it these days. My old list, I used to blame the traffic. Weather used to blame circumstances, right? People say I'm too tall. I'm too short. I'm too old. I was raised in obscurity, raised on a farm. Parents of modest means all the stuff. If you had asked me, how come you find yourself here, Mr Owens, age 25, living in America, land of abundance and opportunity, Kenny's zero in the bank, not doing well. Creditors calling. It would not have occurred to me to blame my philosophy. I found it easier to blame the company company policy. I used to say, if this is all they pay, how do they expect you to do well? So I figured that you know, my future was going to be tied to what everybody else was arranging the economy, right? Interest rates. I used to say things cost too much. That was my whole explanation, not my philosophy until my teacher taught me better that this is where the problem was. My own personal philosophy. Here's what's exciting about each person's personal philosophy. That's what makes us different than dogs and animals and birds and cats and spiders and alligators.

Speaker 3:          30:51          That's what makes us different than all the life forms. The ability to think, the ability to use your mind, the ability to process id is and not just operate by instinct in the winter and I'm telling you, the goose can only fly south. South doesn't look too good, tough luck. It can only fly south, but see, human beings are not like a goose can only fly south. I mean you can turn around and go north. You can go east, you can go west. You can order the entire process of your own life and we do that by the way. We think we do that by exercising our mind. We do that by processing ideas and come up with a better philosophy, a better strategy for our life goals for the future. Okay. Plans to achieve those goals. All this comes from developing our philosophy. Philosophy helps us to process what's available. Well, when we get here, we got seed and we got soil and we got some rain and we've got some hot sunshine and we've got some seasons and what the miracle of life. Now the key is what do you do with all this stuff?

Speaker 3:          32:07          How do you turn all this stuff that's available here into equity and promise and lifestyle and dreams and future possibilities. All of this that's possible now with human beings. How do you take all this stuff and turn it into this equities and values? Well, it starts with philosophy.

Speaker 3:          32:33          What is the seed? What is the soil? It is the sunshine. What is the rain? Is it possible to take some of each of all the stuff that's available and turn it into food and turn it into value and turn it into nourishment, turn it into something spectacular and unique that no other life form can do, and the answer's yes, but you cannot deal with all this stuff and what to do with it unless you start refining your philosophy. Think use your mind, come up with ideas and strengthen your philosophy, so the seed in the soil and the rain and the sunshine. This is called you know the economy and the banks and the money and the schools and everything that's available out there, processing information. What to do with all that and turn it into equity and value. That is the major challenge of life.

Speaker 3:          33:21          My personal opinion, so each person's personal philosophy now is going to determine what you're going to do with seed and soil and sunshine and rain miracle, the change of seasons. That's it. My personal opinion, each person's personal philosophy is like the set of the sail. That's what the seminars for today help you to trim a better sale. You don't need a better economy, you don't need better seed and soil. In fact, when it comes to seed and soil and rain and sunshine and seasons and the miracle of life, that's all you got. Now, what if you blame this stuff? Then you're blaming all you got. If you blame the economy and you blame the schools and you blame the teachers and he blamed the sermons and the preachers and, and you blame, uh, you know the marketplace and you blame the company and company policy. What else is there? When some people get through with their blame list, there is nothing else. That's all there is. And if you blame the only thing you've got to work with, I'm telling you, it's called mistake, colossal and not understanding that that's all you've got to work with. And if this is all you've got to work with, then you don't change the seed and you don't change the soil and you don't change the rain and you don't change the sun sign. You don't change the seasons. Right? Guy Says, I'll take three springs, four summers, nine falls, no winters, no, you can't fool with this stuff. You've got to take it like it comes. Then what do you change to make your life work? Well, you gotta start with your philosophy.

Speaker 3:          34:58          Guess what? I had to do at age 25. In order to change my own future, I had to change my mind. I had to change my thinking. I had to change my philosophy. I was messed up on what was causing my problem and once I got that straightened out that all the stuff I blamed the government and taxes and the marketplace and the economy and things cost too much negative relatives, cynical neighbors. Once I got rid of that and started going for where the real problem was, which was me, I'm telling you, my life exploded into change. My bank account changed immediately. My income changed immediately. My whole life took on a whole new look and color immediately, and the early results I got from making philosophical changes tasted so good. I've never stopped the process from that day until this, and I'm telling you with a little consideration of the refinement of your sale by setting a better sale, refining your philosophy, your whole life can start to change from today on.

Speaker 3:          35:52          You don't have to wait till tomorrow. You don't have to wait til next month. You don't have to wait until spring. Don't have to wait until 93. You can start this whole process immediately. I recommend it now. Some people do so little thinking they don't even have their sale up. I mean you can imagine where they're going to wind up at the end of this week, at the end of this month, at the end of this year. Now is the chance to change process all this information. So number one is philosophy and we dealt with all that. Where are we? Get ideas from personal experience, from other people's experiences. I don't want to get into all those details because we've covered that. The last time I was here philosophy. That's number one, my personal opinion, each person's personal philosophy. Here's the definition of success and failure. Just make this note. Here's failure, a few errors in judgment repeated every day.
