Speaker 1:          00:05          When people don't do things, it's not because they can't. It's not even because they don't want to. It's because of the way they are. Focusing on what I call chunking things. When people don't follow through, here's what they do. Give you an example. Who here believes exercise is very important but you don't exercise regularly? Let me see a show of hands. Raise your hand more hands than most of us want to raise your hand right now. Who here was really focuses or I should say exercises regularly? Raise your hand. Regulate. Okay, great. Who here does not exercise regularly even though you believe it's important just beach with. Okay, great. So let's see what the difference is here. A person who does not exercise regularly, I want you to raise your hand and I want you to tell me why you don't exercise regularly would be truthful.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Okay? Yes sir. I don't have the top guy. Is that true? He even knows it's not true. He's going to answer your first. No. But if feels like he doesn't have the time, cause time is emotion and he's got so many other things, he is focused on getting results in the, adding this to the list seems like a lot. Right. And the other things are very important to him. I guess business, I don't have a time. He has the time. What's the real reason he doesn't do it? Because of the way he thinks about exercise. When he focuses on what it would take to exercise, he does it very differently than someone who follows through. When you think about exercising, what's involved, okay. Starts thinking about, I gotta get to mile 14 or the London marathon and that even the font of trying to get to the 14th mile, much less the 25th mile is like beyond my imagination right now.

Speaker 1:          01:47          So he is what I call over chunked. He's not thinking about what he wants. He's thinking about what's painful. You just saw a perfect example. He's not even thinking about victory. You're succeeding. So the chance of him following through on something that he associates major pain too. When are you can do something else right now. He can feel competent or successful. APP is chances of falling through our very limited. How many would follow that? Say Aye. His focus is on failure. His focuses on pain. That's why he isn't following through. Okay? He's also focused on the 14th mile of a marathon rather than today's workout. Which one seems more daunting to you? So when you think of what is, and here's also what he's thinking about, he's thinking about the process, not the outcome or result he wants. And when you think about what it's going to take the do something, usually it takes a lot and you're not going to want to do it.

Speaker 1:          02:46          So he's over chunked himself. He's trying to eat the whale hall without taking any smaller bites. It seems too big for him. So he says, well, I'll do it when later down my friends will say later, of course, the problem with doing it tomorrow is when you get to tomorrow, Tomorrow's Today. Tomorrow never comes. So when you keep promising yourself, by the way, what does this do to you emotionally when you keep breaking your own promises with yourself or you keep failing to do things that you know are important? Does it increase your lens? Some of certainty and confidence. Know what it does? Is it it? And when you rode competency in one area, believe it or not, it affects the other areas to do. Believe me on that. Don't believe me. What about your own life experience? Maybe not one area, but it starts to be multiple areas.

Speaker 1:          03:35          It sure does. Another reason why somebody has an exercise or do anything is because they don't just chunk it too big a chunk it into many details. I'll give you a perfect example. So I asked somebody one time, I said, uh, okay, how important is exercises? Oh, exercise is extremely important. Really? Okay, good. And tell me why don't you exercise regularly? Well, I and I just don't have time. Okay. Everybody gives that answer. That sounds wonderful. So tell me though, don't tell me about how much time you don't have, tell me this. When you think about exercising, what do you think about, which is a way of saying what do you focus on? And so this woman says to me, well my gosh, you know, I mean I do. What do you mean? When I think about, well, let's say I said to you, you, you got to start exercising and I'm going to put a gun to the head of your children and I will do very horrible things and hurt them badly.

Speaker 1:          04:26          If you don't exercise, could you do it? Oh yeah, I can do it. You know, if I, if you, if some mafia person came here and said, I'm going to kill your children, you don't exercise every day, how many things you can find a way to exercise everyday no matter what your time constraints may be. So remember this, remember this change is never a matter of ability. It's always a matter of motivation. I'll say that again. Change is never a matter of ability. It's always a matter of motivation or drive. Having strong enough reasons. If you've got a stronger, the reason you could figure out the time, couldn't you? So the biggest part of life and time management is knowing what you want and having enough reasons to follow through. But there is one more piece. If you make enough reason to fall through and you'll you want, but you make the task overwhelming, you'll be overwhelmed.

Speaker 1:          05:11          So I said to her, forget what I said, let's just say you really going to start exercising. You're going to do it regularly. How would you do it? What, what? What's involved with exercising? What's involved with exercise? What do you focus? He goes, well, if I was going to work out regularly, I'd, I, I'd have to find a club to join. I said, okay, so we watch it goes well, but you want to know the whole process? Yes. Tell me the whole process of what it would take an extra. She goes, oh my God, I, I, I, I'd have to, I'd have to get on the web and search for like all the exercise places around my home and I, you know, didn't have to look through those and see which one's probably closest or which one is probably the nicest. And I don't really know.

Speaker 1:          05:50          So I probably have to search on the web and like read about it, each of them and get a sense and see the pictures of the place. But of course, you know it's never that way. They really show it to you. They always should have the best pictures. It's not really that nice. So then I have to get in my car and I got to find these places so you don't have to google the location and look it up. And then I drive the I, you know, a lot of times instructions are wrong on Google. So sure enough I get the place, it's not even the right place. And then they have to coldplay, somebody's cell phone there. If they're called the place, I can write down the directions. Of course, I probably don't have a pen. I'm, you know how it is when you're driving.

Speaker 1:          06:18          And so finally I get a pen and I drive down the directions or try to remember in my mind, and I get to the place and now I've got to get a ticket. You know how you get that ticket? And then I gotta go find a parking space and then find a parking space. Then what do I going to do now? I got to go into this place and when you go on the place, you can't just go look around. They want to escort, you don't pay. Some salesperson wants to score it me, so I got to go with the salesperson. They walked me around and they show me the locker room and they show me this and they show me that and they show me all this stuff and then let's say I won't even buy it here. I get just give him a credit card.

Speaker 1:          06:45          Then when we fill out a little application, like I'm two years old again, I'm in high school, oh come on, give me a break. And then I fill out the application. Now I got to pay him and then they want to sell me a 10 million year membership and I just want to try this for six months. And then after all that, then they want to take a picture that looks worse when you take it, then your driver's license plus after that. Now what I do now, I've got a flash. The car going to work out and what I got to do work out, I had to take off all my clothes and I got to hang them up in this tiny little walker where my stuff doesn't really fit and it's going to get wrinkled. I know it's going to fall off and it's going to get wrinkled and be terrible.

Speaker 1:          07:16          So let's say now I do that because now I go to the first station, I got to figure out which station to go to. So now they will probably want to give me some trainers going to tell me what to do. But Let, let's say, dude, I'm like, oh, I go to first nations, somebody sitting, some sweaty, smelly person who gets up and they, they got sweat. All over sudden I gotta take my towel and I got to wipe it all off and then, and then I got to adjust the weight and then I don't know what the right way it is. I got adjusted again and get the hassle of figuring out how to Justin and I finally do my exercise. And then I got to wipe the thing off and then I gotta go find the second station and maybe there's somebody there, maybe it's all sweaty and I don't know the numbers and they have to like do all these one station after station, after station, after station.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Now I got to go to the locker room and take off my sweaty clothes, which I'm going to put in a bag, which I know is going to speak up my car. And then I got to go in and take a shower and maybe I'll first do a steam room or something, but then I'm going to see body parts of other people I don't even want to see. And then they're not going to go on. I've got to do my hair now, do my makeup all over again, start all over my makeup and do the whole thing. All these little pieces and they're going to put on mine now wrinkle clothes and now I can't even just leave. I got to go to the front and I ain't got to get my ticket stamps. I don't have to pay for it. They've got to find the car, which I forgot where it is and then I'm going to shortly the guy and then I dried out.

Speaker 1:          08:23          That's what it takes to work out well. What does it take deed to do it? What do you mean just do it well, I don't know what you want. Tell you. Okay, I know 12 places. Let's go well, but what do you mean? See eating is one chunk. Exercising is 3,229 where every little step of, well I got to do, I think about all the consequences and the elements and the pieces and that's why they don't do it. They're over chunked. What you focus, you feel what you feel. You are moved to somehow actuate, change a question, change your life when it comes to planning your life. I want to get your learned to ask three questions now and the first one is not what am I going to do and how many understand why now say hi. The question one to ask yourself is what do I want?

Speaker 1:          09:18          What's my outcome? What's my result? The word R, p. M. The first one is to get you focused on the target. The target is not the activity. The activity can change. It's what the, what's the result I'm after? If you knew exactly what it is you really want, what you desire, what you're really after, clarity is power. The more clear you are in specifically what you want, the faster your brain can get you there. But if you're generally saying things like, what do I want? Well, you know I want more money. Fine. Here's a dollar. Get outta here. Did you achieve the outcome? Yeah. When you're that general, you may be, you think you're not getting your goal. You are the way you language your goal. Then when you think about it, you're receiving it. You know? You know I, you know, I want to feel a bit better.

Speaker 1:          10:02          I want to lose some weight. Finally, I lost a pound. You're done because your brain's like a servo mechanism and a bomb and a missile. The old days you shoot a missile and the target was going and if you miss the trajectory, you missed it. Today. What happens when the missiles not on course? What happens in locks onto the heat signature and wants to do it moves and follows it. That's the way your brain is. If it knows the outcome, if it knows the result, so rpm starts with I got another result. This is a results planning system. The rapid planning method. You can think of it as a results planning system. I need to know the result I'm after before I ever asked myself what to do. That takes more time but it's worth it now for time's sake. I'm not going to do this with you right now but I'll tell you when I do, when I've taught this to people and I got full weekend to do this and just give you a picture.

Speaker 1:          10:47          If I asked you right now to write out your name, your full name. Now some of you abbreviate your signature but write out your full name and have cursive. Couldn't do that one time right at your full name and curse it. I can't even use the word cursive. Is that really the word people still use means in handwriting I guess, but in cursive. Just write it out in full name because you can do this later on. Now if I add you get with a partner and you can try this later if you want. I'm just going to tell you because I don't want to take the time because they have such limited time today and I have your partner say to you with a stopwatch here, okay, ready? And I go, go and you write it out and you told me when you're done, I go stop.

Speaker 1:          11:22          I write down how long that was. So let's say you wrote out your signature and it took five seconds and then say, ready, write it out. Ready, go. You told me we didn't stop and I write down five seconds. I have to do that 10 times. You'll find in the beginning you'll be, let's say six seconds. I'm making it up. Every signature is different and you probably might get down to as little as five seconds. If you have like an iphone, you can do it as a digital stopwatch. You could see the middle seconds. Then I say to you, I want you guys to write every other letter in cursive. What would you write? Half as many letters? How long do you think it would take to do it? Half as much time. Most of you will take twice as much time in the beginning and then eventually, what's interesting is if I do a 10 times and the last two or three, and this makes no logical sense, and again, I don't want to take the time to have all of you do this 10 times, 10 times, 10 times, but you can do it on your own.

Speaker 1:          12:18          I'll just tell you the result. In most cases, even though you're doing half as many letters, you cut it by two thirds of the time. There's something happens when you break an whole pattern and you do it fresh. Your brain over the years has learned ways to move more rapidly since when you did your original signature and you'll do it in a third. The amount of time. It'll take twice as much at first and then she'll across your third amount of time. Now, let me tell you what I'm telling you. This, the system I'm calling a rapid planning, nothing. By the time I show it to you, you're going to go, this takes more time than just making my to do list. It will win. When will it take more time when initially, but once you get it in your nervous system, it'll take you less time because your brain will be thinking and outcomes and not activities and when you think in terms of outcomes and activities, pretty soon some of the activities and you'll see what lead me to do to get the outcome.

Speaker 1:          13:04          You find a better way to get the outcome quicker. The how do you do that? Yes. Three questions. Question one, what is my result? What is my outcome? What does it I really truly want from this? If you're going back next week and you say this next week, what are the most important? What outcomes for me to get this week in my business? And he was right. Those outcomes are not your action items, the outcomes you, if you do that and nothing else, you'll be ahead of the game. And if you just keep looking at those outcomes every day, how am I doing on that outcome? Your brain will come up with ways to get to that outcome. I promise you. Focus on outcomes, not on activities. Action for most people activities, most people may mistake movement for achievement. They mistake action items. Introduce for achievement. We're after the achievement.

Speaker 1:          13:54          Are you with me on this? Yes or no? It's a different way of thinking and I think all of you inherently have it, but if you make this ritualized, just like the things you've learned this week, they're all great, but if you don't systematize them, they'll work when you do them. But if you systematize them, right, and you see like Mr. Holman here, where he goes in and just does it and does it make sure it's being done again or what you've seen chet do or what I do, you just do it over and over again. You don't miss it. Now the results are geometric. So I want to get you to systematize the thinking, whether you do it visually the way I'm going to show you or not. So first question, what's the result from after? What's the ultimate result? What I want out of this week out of this thing, out of my business, out of my life for my body, and you want to be as what as possible when you described that outcome, that result as well as clear and specific as possible, generalities will confuse you so it might take you longer than just right now called So-and-so to think, if I'm calling my my son, I'm going to call Gerrick or I'm going to call my brother.

Speaker 1:          14:56          This is what goes through my head before I called always, what's my outcome because I don't want to just call them, I want jerk to feel loved by his dad or I'm thinking about what for? How come I got to talk to him about this thing that's out there. I got to make sure I get through to him on this because I want to guide him and moving in this direction. That's what I want to be as his father. I want to, I don't want to just Chit Chat. I can do that too. So if you think before every phone call before every time you're planning your day and you think before you have any meeting, what do you think? The first thing I ask of anyone when we sit down in the meeting is, okay, what are your, what are your outcomes? What are the outcomes to this meeting?

Speaker 1:          15:34          First thing I want to know because if I know the outcomes, guess a lot of meetings, they're done pretty quick because I know the outcome. You don't have to go through all the activities, the sell me on it. Just that's your outcome. How do you want to do it? Sounds good to me. Rock. That's how you make a meeting productive. I know a meeting for Dr Number, the hours or time. Sometimes it takes longer to the outcome than you want, but I'm going to get the outcome. That's by the way, what you see with me on stage, that's my time is very, it's based on an outcome. I'm going to get that outcome. I don't give a damn whether it's the right time or not. I want to do it at that time, but I must deliver the outcome. I'm going to get that. And by the way, how many like to have your company focused on outcomes, results and not activity?

Speaker 1:          16:11          Say I people say all the time, well if you do, you get that done. Well do you want, I left them an email. I left him a voicemail. I sent them three emails. So in terms you heard that. When that happens with me, I'm like, you know, but I don't show it. I just like really? Wow. That's fascinating. We'll explain our about our culture. It's about getting the result. So I can help you if you can't figure another way to do it. But there may be 12 of the things we might want to do. Maybe they don't have the answer. Maybe somebody else can give us the answer. The outcome was to get this information, not to leave an email or 12 or three voicemails that will not do any of us any good. How many faults. Now, whether you get the outcome or not, whether you get that result will be based first. He have clarity.

Speaker 1:          16:58          Think about it. You can look at any business and if you want to know what shifts a business, which shifts your life, there's one force decision making. Decision making is the force that shapes destiny, personal, corporate, business, destiny. How many of you can think of Disney? The decisions that you made years ago, one or two decisions five, 10 15 years ago that that decision you may not have realized at the time, but that decision was one of the most important decisions of your life. You've made a different decision there. You're going a different direction in your life would be completely different today. Who can relate to this and made him, I say hi, secret then is getting darn good and making more effective decisions? No, by the way, are we always going to make the right decision? Yes or no? Absolutely not. No way in a million years, but most people don't have the guts to make the tough decisions because they want to make the right decision.

Speaker 1:          17:49          So they make notices and that's a decision. Is it a true? And what happens is the world takes them over. So decision making is the power. Now, there's three decisions you're making every moment of your life and of your business and making it right now in this room, and if you're watching here on film especially, you might make some decisions because there's, you're not in the environment that's different, but the first decision you're making every moment your life, it affects your life and businesses. What are you going to focus on? Because whenever you focus on, you're going to feel so as a business owner, every employee you have, each day comes in and they make decisions about what the focus on. Some people focus on their own needs. Some people focus on the customer's needs is not going to change the quality of what your business does, how it does, yes or no, a little or completely, completely.

Speaker 1:          18:39          Some people focus on what they can't control every day. Can you predict? If you're focusing every day on what you can't control, how you're going to feel about your life or your business, you're going to be overwhelmed. You're going to be depressed, you're going to be frustrated. Right now, you're deciding what to focus on. You can be focusing on, okay, we're getting into it now. I got the energy, now we're going to get into the meat of this. You're right. All business is decision making, better decisions, better life. Or You'd be saying, wow, my neighbor's smells after all that jumping up and down, notice that focus, right? Whenever you focus on, you're gonna experience though. True. Now some people make a decision and then they focus on the decision about how it didn't work out versus what they learned. Because we're going to be plenty of decisions that don't work out back.

Speaker 1:          19:26          Probably for your honest, most of us forget them, but most of their decisions aren't necessarily the right decisions if we make gutsy ones. But the open decision is the ability to choose again. So focus is a decision. It's happening right now. It's happening in your business. But here's what we're looking for. There's a pattern of focus at some stages in business is you're gonna learn today the focus of the entrepreneur and the business is increasing sales and increased sales, increased sales. And when they're successful, they eventually fail because their sales are increasing. But what's not someone telling me what's not profits? Some people are totally focused on profits, profits, profits. Can you make any company profitable? Yes or no? Sure. You can cut enough stuff. You can make any company profitable for a while, a day, a week, a month, a year, a decade, true. At different stages in the business, you must change your focus.

Speaker 1:          20:17          There's a life cycle to a business. If you're going to make effective decisions, you've got to know where you are on that lifecycle. You make decisions differently for a teenager than a toddler than a grown adult, don't you? Same thing's true in the business and your life, so if you're going to control your life, the way you take controls by making new choices, if you don't like how things are, when you got to do change it and to change it, you have to make a decision. And by the way, leaders make decisions. That's what makes somebody a leader. They have the guts to make the most difficult decision. Nobody else has the guts to make and they know they're going to be wrong, but if they're wrong, what will they do? They'll know what they want, they see it's not working and they'll do what?

Speaker 1:          20:58          Change it, which means don't make another decision, do something new and see if it works. That's the essence of how we grow. So first assisting controls your life is focus. Lots of patterns. Some people focus on what they control. Some focus on what they can't control. Some focus on customers, as I said, some focus on themselves. If you let me this whole business about meeting your needs, you can run a successful business, but it will be a job because you'll never be able to sell it because it was just meeting your needs. It's not a system. It demands your attention. We your connection. It's giving what you want, but ultimately it's not going to give somebody else what they want so he can't sell it. If you can't sell your business, if you don't have an exit strategy, you have a job. I don't care how successful the businesses, he doesn't mean you have to sell the business, but one of the most important decisions you make in business is ultimately, if I was going to sell this by chose to, I have to know who, what I sell this to so that I have longterm value, not just an income or walking away.

Speaker 1:          21:54          I have this critical mass, yet I got a multiple of my business and most people don't have a clear exit strategy. They think all come up with that some day. You're going to start with that end in mind. That's gotta be part of your focus. If you're gonna be successful in your business. I can remember, um, gentlemen has built ca and Hollywood is largest, most successful agency, right? Michael Ovitz, remember that name? He put together Nike and Coca Cola and these billion dollar deals and eventually Mike Ovitz went to go sell that business. He'd never thought through an exit strategy and he got almost nothing for it because the laws prevented him from selling it to a studio. He had to sell it to some of his employees for pennies on its real value. No, Mike found a way to make money later on in another place off of Disney. But the bottom line is the guy didn't have an exit strategy and there was brilliant, made lots of money in the end, didn't get the value focus.

Speaker 1:          22:43          Your first decision is what are you going to focus on? The second decision, the minute you focused on something, you're going to feel it. So if you focus on, oh my God, the economy's coming apart, my industries, you know, people are not buying my product or service, they're shutting it down. Consumers are not spending the money. Is that going to affect your state? Yes or no? Now should you lie to yourself and just pretend there aren't challenges? No, but you're going to have to focus instead on what am I gonna do? What's the need that's still there in any marketplace? There's all one still people buying. I've seen it throughout the years. Even in some simple little business. Let's say you're a realtor, you have your own little real estate office or you kind of your own salesperson. You've got a couple of people that work with you that help you leverage yourself.

Speaker 1:          23:25          Some got simple. I remember years ago I met a woman named Marty Rodriguez. She's from the town I grew up in. She came and one of my seminars and that she be sitting in front row and I did in a year. I made done 25 seminars. She was probably at 10 of them, same seminar in front of low. This is the woman who was the number one real estate agent for century 21 in the free world, nine out of 11 years. I watched her in good times, make money in the worst times, make money. A few years ago, she sold more real estate in the city. She's from than the entire multiple listing service of other agents combined. One person now she built into a business. It's got a whole team that runs it, but it still hurt. She built the brand. How does he do well when it's going horrible?

Speaker 1:          24:08          She says, I love when the economy gets terrible because it gets rid of all those flaky realtors, all those flaky mortgage brokers, there are so many of them. They got in, the business was going up and they all got successful because they're on a trend. When the train crashed, they all left and left me all the business. She loves these times, but the reason that's her focus is different. Does that make sense? Completely different focus. So when you're focusing, you've got to decide what I'm going to focus on. But as soon as you focus on something, even if it's not true, you're going to feel it. So if you think someone tells you, someone screwed you over, they took advantage of you and you're like, what? And you're all upset and you picture in your mind and now you're angry, and then later you've got to confront this person.

Speaker 1:          24:47          You find out it wasn't true. Who's ever had some like this happened? It felt like an idiot. Raise your hand and say hi. But when you focus on it, does it control you? Do you feel it, yes or no? So just write fun. Focus equals feeling. Whatever you focus on, you're going to feel. And as a leader, you're gonna have to manage those feelings and you gotta do it by managing your focus. By the way, if you can lead other people, do you have to create a focus for the company, for the organization to be successful? Yes or no? You've got to find yourself. What are people focusing on? It's affecting all the decisions in the company. So as soon as you focus on that, finally get to decision number two. Decision number two is what does this mean? When you focus on somebody got up to get him to meaning. Is this the end or the beginning?

Speaker 1:          25:29          If you think this is the end of your business, the end of opportunity, the end of our economy, are you going to feel differently and act differently than if you think it's the beginning? Yes or no? See the difference between Joe Kennedy with 4 million bucks in 1929 and Joe Kennedy when 180 plus million dollars in 1932 that big a jump, different focus, different meaning when everybody else said it was the end and it we're focusing on how to survive. He was focusing on how to take market share. He was focusing on what the opportunities, where the meaning for him was. Is this the greatest opportunity of my lifetime? They'll never be another time like this and he made enough money in that time that took care of all his heirs after that for decades to come all because he had a different focus in a different meaning.

Speaker 1:          26:14          Listen, if you're in an intimate relationship and you think it's the end of that relationship, are you going to treat that person the same way as if you think it's the beginning? Yes or no? No. Somebody's laughing over here. They know no way, but you know what? In the beginning of a relationship, what will you do for somebody you love what we do for him? Come on. What? What if they say, would you take out the trash? What do you say? I'll take up the trash of course. What else would you like me to do? Isn't it true after three or four years, they say a five or seven. They go, we take out the trash first. He goes, what do I look like? Your janitor? I don't know what it is. We don't seem to have same attraction. I don't know what happened. Here's, I tell people, treat people at the end of the relationship, like it's the beginning and it won't be in it.

Speaker 1:          27:02          And that's not just your intimate relationship. What if your customers, what if you fell in love with your customers, with your clients more than your product, more than your company? If your entire life was about meeting their needs, if you would do what for your customers, clients, you would do what? If you love your customers and clients, you'd do anything. Guess what? They're going to love you. But most people love their customers and clients as long as they buy from them, do what they want, respond to them. And, um, they don't, they don't that the end. You want clients for life, not just customers fall in love with them. It's a different focus isn't it? It's a different meaning and that creates a different life because you make decisions differently from that place. There's another meaning. You know, is this punishment in my business? Am I being punished by God or am I being challenged or is this actually a gift?

Speaker 1:          27:51          What I'm facing right now? Whatever meaning you give controls what you feel and what you feel controls the third decision, what are you going to do? Right? The minute you give it a meaning, you get a feeling. When you get, you know, a feeling you're going to do something, you're going to take action, you're gonna pull back. A whole economy is driven by this. People start focusing on, oh my God, maybe this is going to go on forever. Maybe I'm not going to get what I need. This might be the end of the way things are. I've been a pull in my reins. I better not spend this money I've been or not take any action. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. How many know what I'm talking about it? So decision making is your power. You want to change your business. Think about whatever's changed your business in the past.

Speaker 1:          28:31          I guarantee which change your business is. Some decisions you made, you made some decisions that shifted your business in a radical way, changed things in a way that shifted the game for you. Decisions about people, decisions about products, decisions about marketing or promotion, decisions about locations, decisions about what you're going to offer, your offerings, decisions you want to change your whole business. You can do it next few days just with some new decisions, but you're going to get stimulated. All kinds of decisions. Look at got to decide which ones will make the biggest difference today. Again, it's going to help you understand where those decisions need to be focused based on where you are in the lifecycle of your business and where you are in your personal life cycle. By the way, you make decisions differently. You'll look at time differently when you're 20 than when you're 30 and when you're 40 and when you're 50 then when you're 60 then when you're 70 yes or no, it'll affect your decisions.
