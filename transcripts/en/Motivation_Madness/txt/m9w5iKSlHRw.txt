Speaker 1:          00:15          I'm only talking to the people that are ready to get to the next level of they life and they career and they're going to boldly walk until the next season of their life. Unapologetically getting rid of all things people in situations that no longer belong in their life. Most of you, most of you, you're so consumed with everything that's going on in the world. This is the reasons you haven't figured out your own life yet. Every blog, every website, every tweet, every instagram post, you are so consumed with everything that's going on in the world. You're ignoring your own world. You can never shine trying to sit on someone else's son. You can never figure out who you are if you consumed and everything that everybody else is and what they're doing in the moves that they're making because you're trying to chase someone else's life. You're trying to chase someone else's lifestyle and identity all while ignoring your own life and your own path. What is the vision for your life? What are the ideas and the dreams for your life? What are you supposed to be doing? Who are you? What are your gifts and talents? What is your ultimate destiny and your goals

Speaker 1:          01:52          and you should understand this, that it was always going to be your family and your friends. That would be the first ones to try and talk you out of your vision and your big idea. That's why you supposed to live your life, focus on your intentions and do your thing. Did you allow yourself worth to be based on what other people think of you? Is the beginning of the end. I believe in me. If you stop believing in me, I'm not going to believe in myself any less. If you believe that I'm irrelevant, that no one is checking for me and that I don't mean anything to the world because you think or believe that about me, it doesn't mean that I'm going to believe it about myself. See, the day that you start living your life according to everybody else's opinion is the beginning of the hand. Most of you guys don't actually know yourself or you don't know yourself. Value. Believe in yourself. Believe in yourself independent of the validation of the world. Have opinions and feelings about yourself, independent of the feedback.

Speaker 2:          03:19          I really think,

Speaker 1:          03:22          and if you get rid of the trash in your life, that can be people, business in situations you too couldn't really like. I really believe that you can reach your full potential. I want you to fly. I want you and your career and your financial blessings to bypass me.
