Speaker 1:          00:13          Ignore the naysayers, rook you ass off, and give back and change the world because if not us, who, if not now when?

Speaker 1:          00:28          What is the secret to success? The long version is that the actually always had five rules and everything that it did. Always use those five rooms, those five rooms help it to become successful in various different areas and I think I believe that those rules can be applied to almost anyone and everyone. You don't need to be a bodybuilding champion. You'll either need to want to be a governor of California or the be an action hero or anything like that. If you want to excel in whatever you do, those rules are for you. It's that simple. Now I have to tell you right off the top that I always was very intense as a kid. That radio was very intense and I was very hungry. I always wanted to be the best. I always wanted to be. Number one. Always wanted to get to the top.

Speaker 1:          01:11          I never believed in. Just getting by. Now I have nothing against people that just want to get by because I think there are many roads to happiness, but I think that we all here like to be successful and we are driven, so that's why those rules apply to you. So my first rule is find your vision and follow it. You see, I think is the most important thing that we have a very clear vision of where we go a goal, where do we go? Because you can have the best ship in the world, you can have the best cruise liner, but if the captain does not know where to go, that ship will drift around the world and outdated. See and will never end up anywhere. And this is exactly the way it is in real life. If you don't have a goal, if you don't have a vision, you just drift around and you're not going to be happy.

Speaker 1:          02:02          This is why it is so important to have that vision. Now, I created that vision in Austria because I grew up after the Second World War, Austria, right along with Germany. Lost the Second World War. Thank God. Uh, and the problem was that everyone was so depressed because they lost the war, that there was alcoholism everywhere. There was of course depression, there was a economic situation, there was famine, there was starvation and all of those things. And also it was kind of a little place in narrow. I felt kind of I wanted to get out of there. I wanted to escape and they couldn't see myself really do work there in the state of the work, in the factory of the work on the farm or the human to follow my father's footsteps and to become a police officer. I couldn't see that either. Some havoc. That's what my parents wanted me to do.

Speaker 1:          02:52          They wanted me to become a police officer and to marry a girl by the name of Heidi and to have a bunch of children and do random round like the funk trapp family and the sound of music. But that's not what I saw. This was the vision of my parents but not mine. And Luckily one day in school I watched the documentary about America and I found myself. I knew exactly that is where I wanted to end up. I wanted to be in America. Everything that I saw in that documentary I just loved every was so big. I remember the tall skyscrapers, the monsters bridges the giant freeway is filled with beautiful cars. The huge jetliners movie stars, Muscle Beach and all of those things. I could not wait to get there. The question was just, how do I get there? How do I get the America?

Speaker 1:          03:43          I mean, there's just another common thing to do. Way Back in the fifties. No one had the money to travel or anything, but one day I was fortunate enough to see a magazine and that magazine showed me the path to America and it was a bodybuilding magazine. On the cover was is very muscular guy that was standing there like Hercules, Hercules outfit. His name was rich park. This rich park was on the cover and I remember the cover said, Mr. Universe becomes Hercules star. I read the article as fast as I could, learning about how he grew up in Leeds in England, poor and how it trained five hours a day, every single day and trained and trained and trained and lifted weights, and then he finally became Mr. Great Britain, and then he became Mr. Universe, if anyone a second Mr. Universe, title in the third Mr.

Speaker 1:          04:38          Universe, title, and then all of a sudden he landed in Rome in gender chitter doing Hercules movies and they made millions of dollars and this, this money. He took embodied themselves, that gymnasium chain in South Africa and he became a successful gymnasium owner and as I read I became more and more certain about my own future. As I read this story, I was so excited, so interested and knew exactly that I wanted to become another ridge park. I know he laid out the blueprint for my life. Basically I could see myself, I could visualize myself clearly to be a champion and that same stage where he won the Mr Universe and then to move to America thing, get into movies and then become rich and famous. I had that vision very clearly laid out. I was so happy that I knew exactly where I was going from that moment on everything that I did.

Speaker 1:          05:33          No matter how hard I had to grow or how much I had to struggle, it didn't matter. It was a wonderful choice, right? Because I knew what the purpose was and I found my passion. The simple truth is, if you don't have a vision, if you don't have a goal, if you don't see a future laid out in front of you, you're just floating around without the purpose, and I think that the numbers speak for themselves. This is why so many people around the world are unhappy with their jobs. I mean, in America, 74 percent of the people hate the job and would like to change jobs, but think about that. That means that only a quarter of the Americans love the life's work. I mean, that is a very depressing statistic. I always smiled when overlooked the middle, how hard I grew up. I always had a great time.

Speaker 1:          06:23          No matter what I did, it didn't matter, but was in bodybuilding over. It wasn't the movie, so it was this governor. I remember in the pumping iron days, people ask me in the gym all the time, why are you smiling all the time? Why are you so happy? You have to lift 50 tons of weights. You have to train five hours a day. I mean, I look at the other body bullets, faces and lift the spaces and did look kind of depressing. That looks sour. They're miserable that they have to lift weights. You look miserable, you look happy, and I tell them always. I smiled because I know exactly what the every rep that I do, every set that I do, every weight and the lift, they get one step closer to turning that vision of mind and the reality of becoming the Mr Universe.

Speaker 1:          07:07          I couldn't look weight to lift 500 pounds in the squats. I could not wait to do another thousand sit ups. I couldn't wait to do bench press bench press more girls and I couldn't move my arms anymore because I knew that every rep got me close to the standing on that stage as a champion, so matter of fact, then I lifted weights. I didn't really feel like I was lifting weights. I felt like I was lifting a trophy over my head each time I lifted and they'll have all those body builders around me and thousands of people screaming.

Speaker 1:          07:42          Can I tell you that this patient didn't just help me in body building? It helped me with everything. Like I said, I remember in the movie business, deb was many times stunts that they had to do it. I got hurt. That was in pain and agony and that to do it over and over again. I remember one incident specific young Conan the barbarian. There I was crawling on all fours, on rocks, over rocks and gravel, holding my swords right in front of me and us that was crawling. The cameras followed me. It was around 30 seats, the crawl under rocks and gravel, and eventually after 10 takes my elbows, my knees are bleeding and hurting and the director came to me. She pushed me and said to me, he says, do you mind if we do another take? I need a closeup of you? And I said to them, no, I don't mind at all.

Speaker 1:          08:37          I said, go into as many takes as you want. This says, no, no, no. I don't want to do that because I know you're in pain. You're bleeding. I said, no, no, no. I don't feel any pain. I said, the only thing I see is, is the finished scene. I see the finished scene of me crawling on all fours with may sort than the front crawling up and sneaking up behind salsa doom, the main building of the and movie that killed my parents and rising up behind him and cutting his head off. That's what I see.

Speaker 2:          09:09          Remember,

Speaker 1:          09:10          crush your enemies. See them driven before you. And here the Lemann Foundation of their women. So this is why, because I visualized that scene, this is why I did not feel that pain. I did not care if I was bleeding on my knees because I know that pain is temporary, but the film is permanent and I explained that to the director. So this is why I tried to tell you, always discover your vision and the rest will follow.

Speaker 1:          09:47          Now, my second, my second rule is never ever think small. If you're going to accomplish anything, you have to think big. You have to go and shoot for the stars. The biggest challenge most people have is because they think small. The reason why people think small and why did you choose small little goals is because they're afraid to fail. They know that if you shoot for big goal, then the chances of failing of very high and they're afraid of failing is one of the most common things. Why people are frozen by the book make a moving live because they're scared of failing. I said to myself, Hey, I'm not worried about failing because that's part of life. You're not going to go going when everything and how far can you fall? Look at this. This is the ground that's as far as I can fall. Didn't know something that the only time you really considered the failure is if you fall and you don't get up, but if you get up, you'll never considered a failure. So I never considered myself a failure. I always considered myself a window even though I fell every so often, but I always got up and I always move forward.

Speaker 1:          10:58          This is the important thing. I never had any patients of course, thinking small because in German we have a saying, Ben Shahn, Dan, Sean, that means that if it was something thing, go all out and do it. Well, this was not just the case in bodybuilding. I didn't just want to be a bodybuilding champion. I wanted to be the greatest bodybuilder four times. I wondered if the muscle, the muscle of all times, the most definition. I wanted the window. Most trophies, the most world championship titles. I just wanted to be the best in the same as Jose movies. I didn't just think about being in movies, no, I wanted to be a movie star. I wanted to have above the title building. I wanted to become the highest paid entertainer. I basically wanted to be another John Wayne. What's wrong with that? And then the same as in politics. I didn't just want to go and be in politics and end the, uh, raised for city council. I'm in, let's be honest, the said sound bites. What's Nega city council? No, come on. What's that guy? May or no, it had to be schwartzenegger running for governor, but not just any governor, but governor of the greatest state in the United States of California. That was the important thing.

Speaker 1:          12:18          I give you an example of big thinking big when that became governor wanted to rebuild cody corneas, ancient infrastructure. You see, America has been living off infrastructure that was built in the fifties and sixties and it drives me absolutely insane that America hasn't started rebuilding that infrastructure. I mean, we invested in new roads or new transit on schools, so in energy or anything like that for decades, the number of cars that we have, nine America have four times as many as we had in the sixties, so therefore we should be having four times as many freeways, four times as many tunnels for them, many bridges and orders, but we don't. So this is why I wanted to get our act together and do the upgrading least in California. So when I talk about infrastructure, didn't really want to just fix roads and fixing close some holes in the roads. I wanted to build massive free on top of freeways. I wanted to build the first high speed rail in the United States. I wanted to build what bridges and tunnels were on ramps and off ramps. I wanted to see literally cranes everywhere. Well, there was no excuse for us to get stuck in traffic and there was no excuse really to send your kids in overcrowded classrooms and schools and there was also no excuse that Los Angeles has a 100 year old sewage system that's shitty. I think

Speaker 1:          13:42          at first, of course some of the legislators looked at me like I was absolutely insane. Mentor told him this vision. They were willing to spend maybe $5 million dollars, which of course is petty cash. He can be to what my vision was, but so some politicians hip hop to see the big picture because they didn't really ever travel outside California. So they haven't really seen big infrastructure. They haven't really seen big infrastructure all over the United States or maybe in Asia, in China or in Korea or in Brazil or in European countries or here in Australia maybe. So they haven't seen that. And then of course the other politicians that simply don't have a vision of the future past the next election, which is a common one. Politicians of all over the world. So it is. It was my job as governor to motivate them and to take them into. To see the traffic jams in Los Angeles and to see the overcrowded classrooms and to see all the problems that be happy to keep pushing and pushing the pump them up enough that eventually this salt, the big picture and eventually Democrats and Republicans came together.

Speaker 1:          14:47          It'd be invested $60, million dollars. You'll be billed California infrastructure, the biggest investment of our state in 50 years. So that's what we did because we had a big vision and everyone bought in on this big vision. So remember, never think small. Think big. My third role is ignore the naysayers. I think it is natural that we have the big vision and big dreams and you have big goals that people are gonna say around you. I don't think it can be done. I think it's impossible or no, I tell you this all the time, but I want to tell you, don't ever let them stop you from dreaming and from shooting for the Gore because eliminators simply those words, no impossible and it can't be done. I mean, in each one of my careers when someone said it's impossible, I heard it's possible when someone said it can't be done.

Speaker 1:          15:47          I heard it can be done, and when someone said no, then I heard loud and clear. Yes, so this is what I believe. I am a big believer of what Nelson Mandela said. He said, it always seems to be impossible until someone does it and that's exactly exactly what it is. And I wanted to beat that one. That does it. I wanted to break the new records and I wanted to do something that no one else has ever done. So I think that's what you need to do. Don't ever be worried about that. Someone hasn't done it. Just think about how many times my career would have stopped. My career would have ended if I would have listened to the naysayers. I mean, it started right away when I was 15 years old and I became a bodybuilder right after it happened. I said, I want to be a world champion in bodybuilding.

Speaker 1:          16:32          I want to be missed or universe. They immediately said, are you crazy? You're in Austria in Australia can become a ski champion or bicycle champion or something like that, but bodybuilding is an American sport. Forget about it. It's nuts. Then men, they wanted to move to America. They said again, it's impossible. You will never be able to do that. You have no money. Your by yourself. And then when I wanted to go into show business after I won 13 world championship titles in bodybuilding, I said, I'm want to the park. I want to be a hercules. I want to get into movies. Well, I tell you, when I met those agents and managers in studio executives, their reaction was so funny. You want to be what? Leading, man. Oh, come on. I mean, look, first of all, let's start with your body with your body.

Speaker 1:          17:29          I mean, you overdeveloped your gigantic. You're like a monster. Are you kidding me? Do you know what the news thing? The new trend is? His little guys like Dustin Hoffman, our Pachino. Woody Allen does set a new sex symbols. Sonia, get it, and then your accent. Oh, it gives me the chills. Just listening to your German bullshit. Come on now, I mean. Oh God. I mean it's that good. Scary when you talk. It's unbelievable. I mean, have you ever. I mean this year is, have you ever seen an international movie? Stop the German accent. It doesn't happen. Forget about that. And then your name, what is it? What's the Schnitzel or something like that? Yeah, I can see that name already up there and the billboard years and people are going to storm the theater, the movie houses because what's starting to move it? Oh yeah, I can see that already.

Speaker 1:          18:24          So that's what they said. They said to me and says, look, forget about that. You're a nice guy. I mean your body building champion, why don't you or health food store or something like that. He can help with that. And then it. Yeah, the side. Some little pots like maybe playing a bouncer. I mean did your body perfect or maybe a wrestler. Oh I have a good idea. But you accent the Nazi officer now. That's really great for you. I called my buddies over at Hogan's heroes. I mean they would probably use someone like you. So that's when they said imagine that every way I turned. They said, no, it won't happen. It's not going to happen and forget about it. Luckily I did not listen. I didn't listen because I knew if I worked hard enough and I've. I grew up as hard as I did embody willing five, six hours a day that I will make it, that I could prove them wrong.

Speaker 1:          19:17          And I started working very hard. I started taking acting classes, English classes, speech classes, dialog classes, even accent removal classes. I ran around all day saying lines like a fine wine grows and the binder goes. You see the Austrians and Germans have a difficult time with the B and w and did the FBI get it on big stuff. So it was a fine wine grows on a vine or the sink is made out of zinc and all those kind of lines is it over and over and you know something. All of a sudden I got a little break in the early seventies. I remember all of a sudden I got a TV show, a little part. Then another little part and then all of a sudden I got a phone call from Lucille ball to be in her special happy anniversary and goodbye, which was with Connie. I had this six minute scene as an Italian, Missouri that most people don't get the difference between an Italian accent in the German accent, so I got away with my German accent, but I played this Italian Mr and I was so delighted and then right after that I got that guest starring role in streets of San Francisco with Michael Douglas and Karl Malden and then pumping on and stay hungry. And then of course I landed the big role as Conan the barbarian. So finally I got the big, big break.

Speaker 1:          20:39          It was so interesting about it was that soon as we were finished with the Conan movie, we were out there on a promotion to a and the director said that the press conference, the directors, John [inaudible], he said, if we wouldn't have had what's Watson that go with those muscles, we would have had to build one. They'll think about that before. It was this huge obstacle to have this body and all of a sudden the director says, if he wouldn't have had schwartzenegger going to be this body, we would have had to build one now. What a turn around, and then when I did Terminator James Cameron said, which was really great. He said that I'll be back. Became one of the most famous movie lines in history because of Arnold's crazy accent because he sounded like a machine.

Speaker 1:          21:30          So as you see everything that the naysayers said was a liability became an asset. Same as also in my political Korea. When I ran for governor, they immediately said, I shouldn't do it. It is a big mistake. It won't happen. I will lose and all those kinds of things that the rest of course is history. The bottom line is, if I would have this is my career would have ended up and that was 15 years old. I will be still yodeling in Austria in the Alps and that would not be talking here. The day the you and the reason why I'm here today in talking to you is just because it did not listen to you can't though. It's impossible or no, so I just recommend to you very strongly ignore the naysayers.

Speaker 1:          22:24          Is Brooke your ass off? Nobody ever stumbled up on success by accident except maybe the guy who found gold in California, but don't ever think that you can be that guy. I'm an idiot. You never want to fail because you didn't work hard enough. I always believed no stone unturned. Work your butt off. That's what I always believed. The middle. What you do, Brooke. Brooke, Brooke. I remember Mohammed Ali, one of my great heroes, had a great line in the seventies when he's. When he was asked how many sit ups you do? He said, I don't know because I started counting. Only when it starts burning, it starts burning. That's when it starts counting. You see? That's what makes you a champion. It doesn't matter what area you're in. No pain, no gain. The bottom line is one of my rules, which is broke your butt off if you don't apply that rule, all the other rules won't mean anything.

Speaker 1:          23:26          I mean, it drives me absolutely nuts when people say, I don't have time to work out who got that many times I don't know if I'm too broke out or I have worked so hard all day. I'm tired. I cannot work out anymore. Oh, I cannot read another book or I improve myself or I don't have time or whatever. Work so hard that I cannot really improve my business or I can grow as a person or any of those things. What the hell of it? Talking about here, I mean today is 24 hours. You sleep six hours, so you have 18 hours left. I mean, I know there's some of you out there that say, well, wait a minute. I asleep actually eight hours, but it's asleep fast. Okay. You didn't get bogged down with this stuff here.

Speaker 1:          24:16          Listening to. I came to the United States. I remember that I trained five hours a day every day and it was managing a construction business and that was a brick layer and I went to college also and that took acting classes from 8:00 at night to 12, midnight of that in one day. Every day I did that. I did not worry about it. I knew that at 24 hours and I didn't want to waste one single hour because I believe Ted Turner said, was one of the great under Brunner's who started CNN and so on. He said, early to bed early to rise. Grew up like hell and advertise. So that's what I believe. Just remember, you can climb that ladder of success with your hands in your pockets. You must work your ass off. It said simple.

Speaker 1:          25:10          My fifth and last rule is don't just take, give something back. Leave your mark in the world. I believe that we all have an obligation to do something for our community, something for our state and something for our country. We must show good cause to this greater than ourselves because we all know that in the end we will be judged not by how much we made, the how much we give. Ever since America greeted maybe dope moms. I've had this sense of responsibility and I felt obligated to give something back to America because I know that everything that I have accomplished is because of America. If it's my body building career, if it is my show, Business Korea, my political career, the money they've made, a great family that I have. All of this is because of America, but I have to recognize the fact that America did not become the land of opportunity in this great country by itself.

Speaker 1:          26:10          No in history, people work tirelessly in America. People fought and died to make it the land of freedom and opportunity in the land of liberty. So now it is our responsibility. If we want to keep it the number one country in the world to grow up for that and to give something back to that country. And it doesn't matter if you're in America, if you're in Australia or if you're in China or in Japan or in Italy, it's the same thing. You all have to give something back to your country, and by the way, you from the love, the words of my father in law, Sargent Shriver, who started the peace corps, job corps, legal aid to the poor during the Kennedy and during the Johnson Administration. He was the number one public servant that he always inspired me to become a public servant. He was one of my heroes.

Speaker 1:          27:01          He's said at Yale University of the commencement speech. He said to the students here at Miro, he had down that mirror that makes you always look at yourself and you will be able to look beyond that mural and you will see the millions and millions of people that need your help. And I saw those millions and millions of people, and this is why I tried to take every opportunity that I could give something back. I started training special Olympians. People did went intellectually handicapped to help them with weight lifting and power lifting. I became the national power lifting coach and the torch torchbearer for Special Olympics, then laid on a joint, the Simon Wiesenthal Center to fight prejudice so we don't have the things happening again. Uh, as we had during the Second World War, during the Nazi Reich,

Speaker 2:          27:56          ed,

Speaker 1:          27:59          I joined also the president's council on fitness that became the chairman or the President Bush from 1990 to 1993 a to be the German and to promote health and fitness in all 50 states at Robert. All 50 states. I started afterschool programs for the most vulnerable children for inner city children to make them be able to say no to drugs, no to gangs and violence and to say yes to education and yes, the life and every single time I reached out and I gave something back, I felt fantastic. Nothing made me happier. I would rather play chess with an eight year old kid in an afterschool program or play golf around the golf with a special Olympian and go down another red carpet of a movie premiere. And I have nothing against movies or to give something back to me is more important than just to think about myself.

Speaker 1:          28:52          Eventually. The joy of giving back was so great that I decided to become a public show fulltime and determined by back. I should walk away from my career as an actor. After they're finished promoting terminated three, I jumped into the race, into the governor's race in California, and that ran for governor. And even though my friends advised me not to do that, they said, are you crazy? Don't you understand that you would lose now this 20 to $30,000,000 a movie that you're getting paid and they will only pay you $178,000 as governor year? Well, I didn't care because I knew that all the money that I've made and the being that position in the first place to make this money is because of America. It was time to give something back. So I became governor. I didn't even take the $178,000. I give it back to the taxpayers because it was petty cash. It's the last thing I needed

Speaker 2:          29:52          and I can tell you that

Speaker 1:          29:54          that those seven years were the most exciting and the most rewarding and the most gratifying years of my life to work all day long to solve problems and to serve the people was absolutely heaven. He was the best job I've ever had, but they also knew that eventually it's going to come to an ent enough to two terms. It did come to an end, but then he came to an end. The one thing that didn't come to an aunt and was not finished was my desire to be a public servant and just to have the people, and this is why I continued to grow for Special Olympics. That's why I continued to grow on fighting my fitness crusade and traveling around the world to promote health and fitness and this is why I continue to support afterschool programs and be even started the Watson institute at the University of Southern California to continue to inspire students and leaders around the world. To find solutions to complicated issues and to give back to make the world a better place. So because.

Speaker 2:          30:58          Yeah, but I tell you

Speaker 1:          31:04          that I was very fortunate that I had great heroes, great heroes that they could look up to, and I mentioned two of them, Mohammed Ali and Sargent Shriver, my father in law, but there's other great heroes like Gorbachev, Reagan, Mandela, great leaders like Mother Teresa, chancellor Kohl and Churchill, and the list goes on and on. I mean, this people had such an impact on the world, single handedly changed the world. I mean, if you think about, just go up at Jeff. I mean this man. Every time I meet him, I'm in all. I mean, he grew up on the communism and he rose from the bottom of the rank, straight up to the top. He can president of the Soviet Union, one of the most powerful people in the world, and he was the lead of the Communist Party and Benny wasn't a top position. He realized that the system was broken.

Speaker 1:          31:57          Now what do you do when you at the top leader of the Communist Party and do realize that the system, that communism doesn't work well. You know, what did, did he dismantled communism? Think about the courage that it takes. Guts did it takes to do that. Think about the Gorbachev completely transformed his country with class, knows to give his people for the first time, freedom and dance through perestroika, reforming Russia's economy. He didn't wait for the next president. He didn't complain. He simply said, if not me, who and if not now, when, so I feel very strongly, all of us need to have an embrace. That kind of spirit. We all can create change whether it is not a neighborhood or in our local schools or in our country. He can be big, but it can also be as little as just going to a school kit that has problems reading and teaching kids how to read or how to do math.

Speaker 1:          33:01          We don't have to just work on me. We should also work on we, not just me, but also remember that lead a truly full live you must give back. You must leave the world a better place than you found it is. The bottom line is it is up to us. I mean those rules that I've given you. Important rules, but giving back is one of the most important rules. I guarantee you that if you follow all those rules, you will have many victories to celebrate. You will leave, you know you're broke and you have extraordinary kind of a record and you will leave a legacy behind that you can be proud of. So I want you to remember those rules. Have a vision. Think big. Ignore the naysayers. Work your ass off and give back and change the world because if not us, who, if not, now when.
