Speaker 1:          00:00:08       There's this thing that exists, this, this multi-headed snake, and it's got this infinity problem. It's everywhere. That's that little circle down there, and the problem is, well, what do you do with it? You cut off one head, seven more, grow. That's the eternal problem of life and the problem is they're there. There is the category of problems in life and it ain't going anywhere. And so the question is can you deal with the whole category at the same time? That's the thing. That's how to be in the world is to deal with that category all at the same time and so how did, how did human beings, what did they come up with as a solution? And that's so cool too, because the solution they come up with not only was the heroism that allows you to approach what you're terrified by and what you find that offensive and to learn from it, but also the idea of sacrifice and that was played out by cultures everywhere, including human sacrifice.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       And you think what the hell was up with those crazy bastard so long ago? They were sacrificing to the gods all the time, but kind of clueless behavior was that burned something and please God burned something valuable and pleased. God. It's like, what was with that? What were they thinking? Well, they weren't stupid. Those people, if they were stupid, we wouldn't be here. They were not stupid, and believe me, they lived under a lot harsher conditions than we do. So those were some tough people, man. You know, back then you'd last about 15 minutes. So you don't want to be thinking of your ancestors as stupid, like there's no real evidence that we're much different cognitively than we were 150,000 years ago. So anyways, sacrifice. What does that mean? Sacrifice? Well, it's a discovery man. It's the discovery of the future. It's like the future is actually the place where there is threat and it's always going to be there.

Speaker 1:          00:01:58       So what do you do? You make sacrifices in the present so that the future is better, right? Everyone does that. That's what you're doing right now. That's what you're doing here. That's what your parents are doing when they pay money to send you to university, they think you can bargain with reality. It's amazing. You can bargain with reality. You can force stole gratification now and it'll pay off at a place in time that doesn't even exist yet. It's like, who wouldn't believe that? It's like that's a miracle that that occurs and it's not like people just figured that out overnight. We were champs for Christ's sake. Like how are we going to come up with an idea like that? While it's like, well, we thought about it for 7 million years and you know, we got to the point where we could kind of act it out, but we didn't know what we were doing, but it was a emerge is like a dream.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       It was so the terror of the future is a dream and his solution to the terror, the dream of the terror of the future is another dream and it comes out in mythology and in fantasy and in drama where you act out the sacrifice and then it's a step on the way to full understanding. So we can say sacrifice now instead of doing it, you know, although we still do it, it's just not conquer like it used to be. We do abstractly and we all have faith that it will work, you know, and we also set up our society so that it'll work. And one thing about, you know, I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a variety of reasons, partly because I think it's an, it's an extreme form of cowardice. But anyways, apart from that, no, no, no, no. There's minimal ways that you can set up a society that will work and so one of them is that this society has to be set up so that your sacrifices will pay off or you won't work, and then the society will die.

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       And so it has to make promises. People have to make promises to one another. And that's what money is. Money is a promise that your sacrifice will pay off in the future. That's what money is. And so if the society is stable, you can store up your work right now. You can sacrifice your impulses and you can work and you can store up credit for the future and then you can make the future a better place, but society has to be stable enough to allow for that. Hyperinflation will do you in. So the promise that's implicit in the currency is the promise that what you're doing now will pay off in the future, and if people don't have that promise, then what? We know what they do because in any gangs, for example, and say gangs in North America, the time horizon of the gang members shrinks rapidly because they don't really expect to be alive.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       Pat Much past 21. And so they get really impulsive and violent and like, why the hell not that's. That's what you do when, when the future doesn't matter, when it's not real you, you default back to living in the moment and you take what you can get right now and no wonder because you don't know if you're gonna, be around in a, in a year and you get whatever you can. Well you can bloody well get it and that's like anarchy that state. And so you don't want to live in, some people like to live in that state because they're really wired for that, you know? And so they're, they're much more comfortable in those conditions. They're, they're kind of like warrior types, I would say in some sense. But you know, for most people, that's just where that stress will just do, you know, the stress of a life like that. So

Speaker 2:          00:05:38       I've said that some people will tell you that the purpose of life is to be happy and those people are idiots and was a bit of a rough statement. But I what I meant by that. It was actually inspired by a statement by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the great critic of the Soviet prison system. And he commented that happiness is something that's done in by the first harsh blow that reality deals you. And, and, and I believe this to be the case. There are many circumstances in life where happiness is not only the wrong response, but also where the expectation of happiness as a response, we'll put you, the person attempting to be happy in absolutely the wrong psychological state, to be prepared for what must be done. People are built so to speak, to experience a very wide range of motivational and emotional states that only bear a tenuous relationship to one another, and the reason for that is that the environment that human beings inhabit is so complex that are adaptation depends on a variety of very finally differentiated responses and so there is a time to be compassionate and there's a time to be aggressive, massive, and there's a time to be in pain and there's a time to be anxious and there's a time to be joyous and a time to be satisfied, and the healthy and well adapted person has a very wide range of finally differentiated responses which cannot be boiled down to a single dimension.

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       Say happiness versus unhappiness. A life is not that simple. If it was, we'd only have one emotional system making happiness. The focal point of your life trivializes your experiences because in order to regard anything as truly important, you also have to regard it's loss as truly meaningful, and that means that to open yourself up to experiences of deep meaning also simultaneously means that you have to open yourself up to the possibility of deep hurt and sore. It's something strange that I've observed with my students is that when I state the proposition tubing clearly that life is suffering and that the purpose of life is not happiness. They actually experienced that as a great relief and the reason I believe that they experienced in this great relief is they already know it. You know, even if they wouldn't necessarily articulate that their experience has taught them that life is complex and tragic and difficult.

Speaker 2:          00:08:04       And the problem with the public portrayal of the ideal state of humanness as happiness is that it makes all of these people. These young people feel ashamed of their own suffering. They feel that if they're suffering and if they find their life tragic in its essence, that that means that there's something wrong with them and instantly that makes it impossible for them to communicate anything real about their own tragedy and so it appears to me that the price we paid for being in suffering and then the issue there, and I believe that this is what the greater religious traditions of the world have been attempting to elucidate is that the purpose of life given that is to identify and and follow a motive being that makes life justifiable even given the radical necessity of suffering. If you're constantly in a state of placidity satisfaction and happiness, then nothing is going to affect you deeply enough.

Speaker 2:          00:09:04       Not your own suffering and the suffering of other people, not injustice, not not the horrors of the world. Nothing is going to affect you deeply enough so that you'll become deep and life without depth is by definition shallow and meaningless, and there's a problem that's associated with that because life is tragic and because life involves suffering. If your philosophy is shallow and meaningless, when you suffer, you will become resentful and hostile and self critical and then you'll become cruel and destructive, and so not only is there a necessity for your own mental health to forthrightly confront the deepest questions of life, but if you don't, then you remained a danger to yourself and maybe more importantly to others,

Speaker 3:          00:09:56       you know, as an adolescent, you also shed childhood potential to become the limited but specialized and potentially useful thing that you will become. And so you might say, well, is it worth it? Is it worth shedding that potential? And Peter Pan's answer to that is, well, no, he wants to remain in Neverland as a magical boy forever, and he's King of the lost boys, which I would say is not a very. That's not much of a dominance hierarchy, right? It's like you're, you're the king king of the King of the losers, so to speak. People who can't get their act together and mature. Now, and you notice in Peter Pan that Peter Pan doesn't grow up. He doesn't establish a relationship with Wendy who's actually real. He has to settle for Tinkerbell who you know is a ferry and they don't exist and so she's really in some sense of figure of his imagination because he won't mature, he can't have an actual relationship with a genuine person.

Speaker 3:          00:10:51       So he has to satisfy himself with while it's something like a pornographic fantasy actually. So seriously it is. It is like that. I mean it's, it's, it's a toned down a lot in the movie version obviously, but still that's what's underlying it. Now you might say, well why doesn't Peter Pan want to grow up? And the answer is the only figure of authority that's around for him as his captain Hook and he doesn't like Captain Hook. And that's because captain hook is a tyrant. He's brutal, you know, and he's also a coward because he's, he's lost a hand already to a crocodile with a clock in its stomach. That's chaos and time, you know, that's the dragon that lives underneath everything. It's like the basset lisc can Harry Potter and that Damn Crocodile's already got a piece of him, which is exactly the case. Like that crocodile has got a piece of me, you know, I'm older than 50 and so time is already God, its grip on me and you know, part of the problem of being adult is that you also have to take the fact that your finite and limited into account and if you're terrified by that, which people tend to be, then it can easily turn you into a tyrant because you're afraid of everything or disgusted by everything and you have to ramp up the amount you control it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:59       And so Peter Pan looks at Captain Norcott, he thinks there's no damn way. That's what I want to end up as. So he's got a bad role model. I've been telling people online in various ways in the lectures the patient start fixing the world. Bye.

Speaker 4:          00:12:13       Cleaning up the room and I want it to just elaborate on that a little bit before I get back to the lecture itself. So I'd say it's become this Internet weird Internet meme, you know, and, and, and, and it's a joke and good. It's a jewel. I'm really happy about the fact that so much of this has got like the leaving of humor and it's really important because that's what stops things from degenerating into into conflict humor and I was thinking about this idea of cleaning up your room in relationship to the mustard seed idea and you see the thing about cleaning up your room. This is also something I learned from Carl young and his studies on alchemy because for young, when the alchemist was attempting to make the philosopher's stone, he was not only engaged in the transformation of the material world, but he was engaged in a process of self transformation that occurred at the same time as the, as the chemical Trent, as the chemical transformation.

Speaker 4:          00:13:08       So it was a psychological work in some sense. Let's say you want to sort out your room and beautified because the beauty is also important and let's say that all you have is just a little room like you're not rich or you're poor and you don't have any power. That's another thing, but you've got your damn room and you've got this space right in front of you. You know that, that that's a part of the cosmos that you can come to grips with and you might think, well, what's there in front of you right in front of you? And the answer to that is it depends on how open your eyes art. That's the proper answer because you could say, w William Blake said this, for example, eldest Huxley made comments that were very similar that in a transcendent state, you can see infinity in the finite and you might say, well, you can say, and you can see infinity in what you have within your grasp.

Speaker 4:          00:13:51       If you look and you could save, maybe that's the case with your room and so you want to clean up your room. Well, okay, how do you do that? Exactly? Well, a room, his room is a place to sleep and so if you set your room up properly, then you figure out how to sleep and when you should sleep and how you should sleep and then you figure out when you should wake up and then you figure out, well what clothes you should wear because they have to be arranged properly in your dresser and then you have to have some place to put your clothes and you're going to have some clothes. You have to figure out what you're going to wear those clothes to do. Right, and then that means you have to figure out what you're going to do and then your room has to serve that purpose because otherwise it isn't set up properly.

Speaker 4:          00:14:27       And if it doesn't set up, if it doesn't serve your purposes, you will be unhappy and not happy in the room. Because the way that we perceive the world is as a place to move from point a to point B in. And then if the place that we're in facilitates that movement, then we're happy to be there. And if the place that we're in serves as an obstacle to that movement, then we're unhappy to be there. And so what it means to set up your room is that you have to have somewhere to go that's worthwhile, or you can set up your room and your room has to be set up to facilitate that. And then the next thing is, well, maybe you have to make it beautiful, but that's not easy, right? That means you have to have some taste and that doesn't mean you have to have money.

Speaker 4:          00:15:09       It doesn't, because you can be garish with money and you can be tasteful with nothing. All you need is taste and taste beats money when it comes to beautifying things. Not that money is trivial because it's not. But taste is crucial and people who are very artistically oriented can make beautiful things out of virtually nothing. And not only that, the literature suggests that if you're going to make beautiful things, putting real constraints on, on what you allow yourself to do, facilitates creativity instead of interfering with it. Because let's say you have to make something out of nothing, right? Which I suppose would be a Godly Act, right? You have to make something out of nothing. You have to be creative in order to do that, and so then to beautify your room means that you also have to develop your capacity to be creative and so then you can make your room shine, but then what will happen is that if your family isn't together, they will interfere with that.

Speaker 4:          00:16:03       You will interfere with that because you won't have the discipline to do it properly, but then when you start building this, this, this little microcosm of perfection with what you have at hand and it'll evoke all the pathologies of everyone in your household. The wonder what the hell you're up to in there and they won't necessarily be happy because if you're. If they're in a lowly place, let's say and so are you and you're trying to move out of that, then the higher you move out of that, the more the place they're in looks bad and you might say, well, what they should do is celebrate your victory over chaos and evil, but that isn't what will happen. What will happen instead is that they will attempt to pull you back down. They'll attempt to. I mean obviously all families don't do that, but, but all families do that to some degree and some families do almost nothing but that.

Speaker 4:          00:16:50       And so what that means is that if you're going to organize your room, then you're going to have to confront the devils in your house and that's often. That's often a terrifying thing because some of those devils have have lineages that go back many, many, many generations and God only knows what you have to struggle with in order to overcome that. And so and then and so to sort yourself out into fix up your room is a nontrivial matter. You know, and you can do that. You'll learn by doing that and then maybe you'll learn enough by doing that so that you can fix up your family a little bit. And then having done that, you'll have enough character so that when you try to operate in the world at your job or maybe in the broader social spheres, that you'll be a force for good instead of harm.

Speaker 4:          00:17:33       Because you will have learned some humility by noting just how difficult it was to put your damn room together well and yourself for that matter, and so you'll proceed cautiously with your eyes open towards the good. I talked to people very frequently whose families have them with too much protection and they know it themselves and that means they're deprived of necessity. You know, one of the things that you see in the United States, for example, is that the children are first generation immigrants often do better than the than the than their children. And the reason for that is that the children are first generation immigrants, have necessity driving them and you don't know how much you need necessity to drive you because maybe you're not very disciplined. And if an a catastrophe doesn't immediately befall you. If you don't act forthrightly today, then maybe you'll never act forthrightly, right?

Speaker 4:          00:18:23       Because the gap between your foolishness and the punishment is, is lengthened by your unearned wealth. And so you never grow up and learn and you have to get yourself away from your dependency in order to allow necessity to drive you forward. And that's to become independent and to become mature. And I think part of what's happening in our culture is that the, the, the force that's attacking the forthright movement forward of young men in particular is afraid of the power of man because it's confused about the distinction between power and authority and competence. Like I know a man who's who has authority and competence has power as a byproduct, but the authority and competence is everything. And, and, and people who can't understand that fail to make the distinction between power and authority of competence and they're afraid of power and so they destroy authority and competence. And that's a terrible thing because we need authority and competence. What else is going to, what else is going to allow us to prevail in the long run? And so you get away from your country and you get away from your kin and from your father's house, right? And you go out there and you establish yourself in the world. It's a call to adventure. That's what this, the first lines in the Abrahamic story is a call to adventure. So great unto a land that I will show you. Well, you know, what does that mean?

Speaker 4:          00:19:55       You know, one of the things that I've been struck very hard by a number of writers, Carl Young, obviously among them, I mean he, he wrote things like Nicha that if you understand them, they just break you into pieces you know, and one of the things that you and understood in the psychoanalysts understand, it's one of the most terrifying elements of psychoanalytic thinking is very tightly aligned with religious thinking, which is that you are not the master of your own house. There are spirits that dwelling within you, meaning you have a will and you can exercise a certain amount of conscious control over your being, but there are all sorts of things that occur within you that seemed to be beyond your capacity to control your dreams. For example. That's a really good example of your impulses. For example, you might, you might think of those as so foreign from you that they're not even.

Speaker 4:          00:20:45       You don't even want them to be part of, but, but more subtly even. How about what you're interested in? What compels you like where does that come from? Exactly? Because you can't, you can't conjure it up of your own accord, you know, so if you're a student and you're taking difficult course, you might say to yourself, well, I need to sit down and study for three hours, but then you sit down and that is what happens. Your attention goes everywhere and you might say, well, whose attention is it? Then? If it goes everywhere because you say it's your attention, it's like, well, if it's your attention, maybe you'd be able to control it, but you can't. And so then you might think, well jen and just exactly what the hell is controlling it. And you might say, well, it's random. It's better not be random.

Speaker 4:          00:21:28       I can tell you that that's, that happens to some degree in schizophrenia. There's an element of randomness in that. It's not random. It's driven by the action of phenomena that I think are best considered as something like subpersonalities or they'll even. That's only a partial description. You can't make yourself interested in something. Interest manifests itself in grips you. That's a whole different thing. And so what is it that's gripping you and how do you conceptualize that? Is that a divine power? Well, it's divine as far as your concerned because it grips you and you can't do anything about it. And so there's a calling in you towards what you're compelled by and what you're interested in, and sometimes that might be very dark and sometimes not, but you're compelled forward by your interest. And so and so the idea that what moves you away from your country and your father's house and the comforts of your childhood home is, is something that's beyond you and that you listened to in Harken to.

Speaker 4:          00:22:31       That's exactly right. And you can say, well, I don't want to call it that God. It's like it doesn't matter what you call it. Exactly. It doesn't matter to what it is, what it's called. It still is. And if you don't listen to it, that's the other thing. If you don't listen to it, and I've been a clinician and talked to enough people now as old as I am to know this. Absolutely. If you do not listen to that thing that beckons you forward, you will pay for it like you cannot possibly imagine. You'll have everything that's terrible about life in your life and nothing about it that's good and worse. You'll know that it was your fault and that you squandered what you could have had. So this is not only a calling forth, but a warning unto a land that I will show thee and that's it.

Speaker 4:          00:23:20       That I will show the that and you don't want to be too concrete about this. You know, there's all sorts of new territories that you can inhabit. If you abstract and conceptual territories of Gilda University and you study biology or you study physics or, or any discipline, you're in a territory, right? You're in the territory that all of the scholars have established and then as you master the discipline, you move out beyond the established territory, into the unknown. And that's a new right. Maybe it's even a land of your enemies for that matter, but it's a new land to the frontier is always in front of you. And so you know, when they earth was less inhabited than it is now, the frontier was the psychological frontier and the geographical frontier was the same thing and now they've separated to some degree because there's not so much geographical frontier, but there's the frontier is a place that never disappears and the land that's beyond the land that you know is always there.

Speaker 4:          00:24:11       And it's always where you should go. And all of that packed into these four phrases so well. So when I've been thinking about narrative, you look at the world through a story, you can't, you can't help it. And this story is what gives value to the world or or the stories. What you extract from the value of the world. You can look at it either way, you're somewhere and it's not good enough, right? That's the eternal human predicament. Wherever you are, isn't good enough. And to some degree that's actually a good thing because if it was good enough, well there's nothing for you to do. So it's actually maybe a good thing that it's insufficient. And that might be why sometimes having less is is better than having more. And I don't want to be a pollyanna about that. I mean, I know that there's deprivation that can reach to the point where it's no where it's completely counterproductive, but it isn't always the case that starting with little is you.

Speaker 4:          00:25:06       If you start with little, you start with more possibility. It's something like that. So you moved from always from what's unbearable about the present to some better future. Right? And if you don't have that, then you have no, you have nothing but threat and negative emotion. You have no positive emotion because the positive emotion is generated in the conception of the better future. And then the evidence that you generate yourself, that you're moving towards it. That's where the positive and fulfilling meaning of life comes. So you want to set up this structure properly. It's very, very important. And so what it means is that you want to be going somewhere that's good enough so that the going is worth the while and you can ask yourself that. And that's partly what we tried to build into the future authoring program, which is, well, we know what's wrong with life.

Speaker 4:          00:25:51       It's rife with suffering and insufficiency and deception and evil. It's all of that obviously. Okay. What would make the journey worthwhile? Well, you can ask yourself that. It's like, alright, right. In order to bear up under this load, what is it that I would need to be striving to attain? And if you ask yourself that, that's to knock and the door will open. That's what that means. If you ask yourself that, then you will find an answer and you'll think you'll shrink away from it. You'll think, well, there's no way I could do that. It's like, well, you don't know what you could do. You don't know what's possible and you're not as much as you could be, and so god only knows what you could, what you could do and have and give if you sacrificed everything to it. And that's the reason that Abraham is constantly making sacrifices.

Speaker 4:          00:26:40       It's archaic, right? He's burning up like baby, but like, well, they're alive. You know that's something and they're valuable and that's something it's you have to admit, even if you think about it as a modern person, that the act of sacrificing something might have some dramatic compulsion to it, you know, to go out into a flock and to take something that's new board and to cut its throat into bleed it into burn. It might be a way of indicating to yourself that you're actually serious about something and it isn't so obvious that we have rituals of seriousness like that now and so it's not so obvious that we're actually serious about anything and so maybe that's not such a good thing and so maybe we shouldn't be thinking that these people were so archaic and primitive and superstitious. It's possible that they knew something that we don't.

Speaker 4:          00:27:25       It's certainly in the abrahamic stories. One of the things that maintains Abraham's covenant with God is his continual willingness to sacrifice it. It's so that sacrificial issue is so important because you are not committed to something unless you're willing to sacrifice for it. Commitment and sacrifice are the same thing and I think its borders on miraculous that those concepts are embedded into this narrative at the level of dramatic action. You know, instead of abstract explanation, people are acting this out and the fundamental conception is so profound that it's really quite. It's quite inspiring and it's breathtaking. Really, when you understand what message is trying to be conveyed, you have to make sacrifices and what do you have to sacrifice. You have to sacrifice that which is most valuable to you currently that stopping you and God only knows what that is. It's certainly the worst of you.

Speaker 4:          00:28:19       It's certainly that and god only knows to what degree you're in love with the worst of you so well, so you moved from the unbearable president to the ideal future and and you can't help that. You have to live in a structure like that. That's your house. That's another way of thinking about it and if you want to get your house in order and if you want it to be a place that you can live properly, then you have to plan the future. That is perfect. And then I think, well, what does that mean? It means it's good for you. Right? And one of the things that I, I'm, I do all the time with my clinical and consulting clients is trying to figure out what would be good for them, but we do more than that. We try to think, okay, well what, how can we set this up so it's really good for you?

Speaker 4:          00:29:07       And that all the consequences of that are things that are good for other people. And so because people are often also timid about trying to get something that's good for themselves because they feel that it's selfish or that they don't deserve it. So we set it up so that. Well look, we're going to set it up so that it's plainly obvious that this will not harm the structure of the universe for you to have what you need and to do it in a way that's of benefit to other people. There's no downside, right? So let's say you have oriented yourself but not perfectly because you're full of and errors.

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       So then what do you do? Because you have to fix those errors. But you still have to be oriented.

Speaker 5:          00:29:50       This is why I started getting interested to get interested in the phenomenon of meaning as a, as a phenomenological experience to experience something as meaningful. It's not exactly obvious what that means to experience something as meaningful. I think that you can, you can approach it obliquely, you know, like if I said, watch yourself for two weeks and notice when you're doing something that you regard as meaningful, I could say, well here, here's some, here's some markers. You lose a sense of time. You lose a sense of vulnerability. You're deeply engaged in it. It seems, it seems worth the effort, right? You forget yourself while you're doing it. Maybe you forget your existential concerns while you're doing it. You're not ruminating or obsessing about the meaning of your life. Right? So, so there's markers for, it's like the flow states that chicks at my highly described. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:30:42       and then you can experience it. You experienced it under a certain sort of ritualistic conditions. You might experience it when you go see a great movie, you might experience it when you listen to music. I think music is a very, very standard pathway for people to have that kind of experience because virtually everyone gets intimations of mute of meaning from music and I think music music is hierarchically structured patterns that are representative of being laying itself out properly. It's something like that, so it's an abstract representation of proper being and so we can. We can grapple with the phenomena of music and we can. We can bark or phenomenon meaning we can box it in a little bit and start to conceptualize it.

Speaker 6:          00:31:26       W

Speaker 5:          00:31:26       we can start to conceptualize it perhaps as the manifestation of a deep instinct and so I would say well meaning is what manifests itself when you are,

Speaker 5:          00:31:39       when you've oriented yourself properly and when you've optimized the flow of information between you and you, between you and chaos. That might be the right way of thinking about it because literally you think about a piece of music because you want it to be predictable, but you don't want it to be perfectly predictable. You want it to be predictable with some interesting variations and predictable with some variations that make sense and maybe you can conceptualize that as something like this. It's like it's predictable at this order of of stability, but it's varying down here from time to time and so you've got stable stability there, but variability there and you can handle that so you want an overarching structure stability with some internal variability and maybe that's the way that you update yourself without falling apart, and then I would say you can find the pathway to the optimal rate of update by relying on your sense of meaning.

Speaker 5:          00:32:39       That's what it's for. What it tells you is that you're. You're wandering you're way through the world between the catastrophes of chaos in the catastrophes of order and now and then you swing into the proper locale. You're, you're where you should be, and what happens is you get engaged by that. You get meaningfully engaged by that and it's fragile. It'll move on you, right? Because it's very difficult to exist at that point constantly. Your bad habits, all sorts of things, your situation. There's all sorts of things that are going to interfere with that, but that doesn't mean that that isn't where you should be, and so then you might say, well, that's where you should strive to be all the time, and then the question might be, well, what would it be like if you were there all the time and I think that's where intimations of paradise come from being when words think it was words.

Speaker 5:          00:33:30       Wordsworth talked about intimations of immortality and childhood. People tend to romanticize their childhood because of the sense of intense engagement that goes along with being a child and it's one of the wonderful things about being around children. Actually. It's, it's, it's why they pay you for their care and the way that children pay you for their care is that they turn normal things into magic again when you're around them because you've seen it 100 times before. And so when you see it, you don't see it. You see what you already know. But when a child sees that they don't because they don't know, they see it. And then when you watch them see it, you see it too. And so it's just, it's tremendous fun leading a small child around to do things that you've done before because they're so, you know, they're like this, they're like all the time and you know, maybe that's too much.

Speaker 5:          00:34:19       Then they cry and they get upset and all of that, but a good part of the time it's just wild eyed wonder and then you can see the world through their eyes and it's payment. And so that's that sense of being engaged. Like that is something that people love about children and rightly so, but it's also a marker to the proper way of being. You know, there there's a dictum in the. This is a union idea that there's no difference between the archetype of the wise old man in the archetype of the child. They're the same thing because the wise old man is the person who found what he had in childhood but lost. Right? It's a. that's a very powerful moment. Tif is that the purpose of maturation is to return to this state of childhood as a mature being, not to stay in the state of childhood, that's Peter Pan, but to make the sacrifices necessary for maturation and then return so well.

Speaker 5:          00:35:09       How do you do that? Well, you do that in part by noticing what it is that's meaningful for you to engage in. I would say it's your nervous system reporting to you, right hemisphere and left hemisphere balanced. The balance between chaos and order produces an output that says you are in the right place. It's a perception. The meaning is a perception of being in the right place. It's the genuine thing. However, because it can be pathologized. That's the thing and that's why I think there's a call to virtue in most great religious traditions. If you're going to rely on your sense of meaning to Orient you, you have to play a straight game because otherwise you warp and twist the inputs and then the mechanism won't function properly. You know? It's like if you. If you were only.

Speaker 5:          00:35:55       If you're, if you blinded yourself to half the world, you can't use your perception story at yourself properly because the half of the world that you ignoring is going to pop up at you unexpectedly and take you down, and so if your relationship with the world isn't pristine, honest, primarily, then you can't rely on your own internal orienting mechanisms and then you either fall into chaos which is an absolute catastrophe or you have to rely on some kind of external authority and that makes you prone to possession by tyrannical etiologies, for example, which give you that sense of meaning that you should in fact have as a consequence of your own action.

Speaker 7:          00:36:31       What should you be aiming for in your life? I can. I can tell you that roughly speaking, if you're looking for something that will give your life meaning, that's, that's. That's actually quite straightforward as far as I'm thinking in detail. This is where the nihilists happened so wrong that it's almost unbelievable as far as I'm concerned. Fundamentally, they're just escaping from responsibility anyways. Even though they are perfectly rational arguments for their nihilism. Everything's meaningless. It's like, no. First of all, no pain. It's not meaningless. You never going to meet anyone who will tell you that their pain is meaningless so we can forego the whole meeting was right off the bat. There may be no positive because yes, we can have a discussion about that, but south the negative meaning exists and everyone knows even someone who's in Archicad, nihilistic to the core drug, a spike through their hand, they're going to act like that has meaning and since I'm not an existential and look at how people are instead of what they say and they'll act out the idea that that has meaning very, very rapid, so we'll just go with that.

Speaker 7:          00:37:36       Now you might say, well, there's all sorts of, but that's not the kind of meaning that I believe doesn't exist. I believe that only positive meaning doesn't exist, which is a little on the negative side, I would say at the beginning, but I can understand it. People have. People can have pretty dreadful lights, you know, and you can easily get yourself into a situation where it seems like there's nothing at all to your life. Accept suffering. And that's what happens to people who become suicidal, for example, and it's no joke and they have the reasons. Now you know sometimes those people have been hurt in ways that are absolutely unimaginable and so when they see a horizon that's full of nothing but suffering, you can't just wave that away, but I would say

Speaker 7:          00:38:17       the first thing we might hypothesize is that pain is an unalterable fact of meeting and certainly seems to be negative, but one of the things you might want to try to orient yourself in relationship to is the reduction of human suffering. Now, because I think that's you know the answer, what you do about a child who's suffering in a concentration camp is it who the hell is going to care the billion ears, right? That's not the right answer. And if it's not the right answer in that situation that perhaps it's not the right answer at all and the right answer to who the hell is going to care anyways in a million years is why the world would you frame in state that idiotically mean anybody, anybody? This has kind of a trick of the imagination in some sense of anybody who's quick witted can come up with a frame of reference that makes anything that makes almost anything, lack meaning within that frame of reference.

Speaker 7:          00:39:12       What all that means to me is that you pick the stupid frequent reference, right? Why should you? Why should you? Except without doubt, the consequence of your stupid algorithm. Who's going to care in a million years? Yeah, God, really, you got to be able to do better than that. If that's what you're going to wipe meaning. Well, so what do you want for meaning? All right, reduce suffering. That'd be a good one. You could devote your life to that and I would say start locally and, and, and I think this is the alternative to rightly nationalism and which is too much order and left wing the chaos, which is too much chaos. We don't want to go down that rabbit hole again, either of it. So what's the alternative? I thought about this for a very long time. It took me decades to come to this conclusion. The conclusion is just that you straightened yourself out and you do that humbling.

Speaker 7:          00:39:59       Here's this idea that the new testament, which I get quite a kick out of, that you're not supposed to pray in public and a little more complicated than that. Actually. You're not supposed to frame the problem until you sorta out the dispute that you have with your brother. For example. I really like that idea because what it means is that you shouldn't make a public display of your virtue until you've straightened up your damn life, and this is one of the things I really liked about protests and I really don't like the fact that university students are taught by their pathway and professors. That the way that you change your world.

Speaker 6:          00:40:30       Thank you.

Speaker 7:          00:40:42       You don't change the world by going and waving signs that people that you've defined as more equal than, but first of all probability that they're more useful than you is actually quite low because he up may be you're in the same damn boat and if you've divided the world up conveniently so that you can identify the innocence and the and the dam or the oppressor and the oppressed, and you think that if you're in the positive category, then the probability that you're part of the solution and not part of the problem is zero. So it's just not that easy. Know I'm the most profound people that don't have you said the same thing over and over. It's like the line between good and evil runs down the middle of every human heart and the first thing that you're supposed to do is win that battle on your own territory, and that's no bloody joke.

Speaker 7:          00:41:27       That's a difficult thing to do because it means that you have to recognize that. Recognize yourself as a of gravy and that is what you are and that's a terrible thing for me to learn. You know, when you look at the 20th century and you think, well, who brought on the horrors of the cognitive systems and the horrors of the Nazi system is the answer is people just like you. That's the answer. If you don't understand that and you think that answer is wrong, then you're not very wise and the and it's not surprising because the price that you paid for wisdom, this is radical disillusion, disillusion lip and the confrontation with England and no one wants that. Really. It's a terrible thing to confront and that's because human beings are terrible creatures. Now. I think we're also absolutely remarkable creatures and wonderful creatures. We have an unlimited capacity for brutality and evil and every one of us carries it, and so what you do is you try to sort that out in your own life and you start.

Speaker 7:          00:42:25       I haven't gotten to talk to me just a while back about about his life. Haven't been going very well. He decided to put himself together and he started doing this little ritual thing, which I thought was quite cool. He was kind of an isolated guy, very overweight guy. When I talk to him, he lost about 130 pounds, which was quite impressive for this part of the putting himself together, but he started doing it by bill. He had a bunch of labels leftover from his childhood and the first thing he did, because he was feeling very nihilistic and hopeless, he, he, he found that he got a little bit of satisfaction out of building little things, other labels, you know, and I thought, well that was pretty interesting. And so he built a bunch of these things and then he said, well, I got a bunch of these things built.

Speaker 7:          00:43:03       Then I had to figure out how to organize them in the room angry. I thought that's cool because he started higher resolution at the level of detail. You know, what it was building something that was trivial. He knew that he was just playing the game, but then as soon as he had a collection of those, then you have to sort out the space that he was going to organize them in many figured out under sort of the room that they were going to be. So we started organizing and beautifying the room and at the same time he modified his diet and he was putting himself together. That's the right thing to do. That's the right thing to do is that there is, there are responsibilities that are awaiting you, right that are in your own grass and you know what they are. And this is also something that no one can preach to you about.

Speaker 7:          00:43:43       It's something you have to decide for yourself and you can do it quite straightforwardly. It's something that I do on a regular basis. You sit down the anything or in the morning and ask yourself like you're asking someone that you want the answer from like really genuinely needed to have the chicken. Not telling yourself none of that. You're asking yourself, right? There's a bunch of things about my life that are in an order that aren't together and I know it and they're making me suffer and they're making me less than I am. And there's some of those things that are staring me right at the face and I know what they are. And there are some of those that I can put in order today with a little bit of work so that when I wake up tomorrow, the domain of my experience, which is basically being itself, that the main, my experience will be more pristine and better put together than it is today.

Speaker 7:          00:44:32       And you asked yourself that, you will find that right away. You know what they are finding things that come up, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, and they'll all be things that aren't very heroic. They're kind of trivial and that you knew the voiding you've been avoiding me. Those are little dragons of chaos. They space and you know they're just little. That's good because you're not much of a hero warrior. And so maybe a little tiny dragons are all the ones that you've been put up. You know, you sort those things out and they will. First of all, they will order. You're in an order that being around you in a more pristine and productive way. I think you just a little bit more focused in together. And what that'll mean is that the next thing you can do is ask yourself the same question and the end of the problems that will emerge will be slightly larger and more complex, and then you can try to put those in order and that will make everything around you more pristine and benefit together and it'll make you a little bit stronger and more clear habit.

Speaker 7:          00:45:24       And then another set of problems will emerge that's a little bit larger. If you continue to do that, you know you'll sort yourself out, you clean up your room and you put your house in order and then you could start to work in the community and by that time you'll actually have some power and some and some self confidence and some competence and some cream cheese and you'll be much more, much less likely to stupidly hit something complicated with a stick and say that you fixed it, but you have to start low. You have to be Carl Jung said, very an interesting one, interesting phrases. He says that the reason that monitor people can't see this because they won't look low enough. I really liked that. I mean, he's an extraordinarily wise person. What he meant by that was something like what I'm telling you is that the secret to your existence is right in front of you and it manifests itself as all those things you know you should do, but you're avoiding because one of the things you might ask yourself as a curse, you're useless and weak and miserable and cruel than all of those horrible things, but partly that's because you're also not what you could be in.

Speaker 7:          00:46:23       Part of the reason for that is that what you know you shouldn't be doing. So you might ask yourself, because this is a very interesting game. If you started doing the things that you know you should do, this is a discussion with your own conscious. If you started doing those things that you know you should do and you did that diligently, what beheld would you be like in 10 years? Now? That's an exciting game. That's an interesting game and if you play that, we will find that you're hell a lot more than you were and that's something at least you might not hit the pinnacles that you're going to be a lot more than you are, and then if you're not and miserable or direction in sovereign digital, sound, pitying and all those things, you're going to be a lot less resentful. You're going to be a lot less broom.

Speaker 7:          00:47:05       You're going to be a lot less cruel to yourself and to other people. Well, that's a pretty good start. You know? Even if you're not a positive force for good in the world, if you just were wretched horrible, that would be a good additional contribution. No, you. I would say too, there's a corridor that goes along with that and I, and this is so, so you could look at it this way. This is something that I tried to explain. I didn't video on a couple of videos which I've been fascinated by because it's a very good relation and cultural. How architects manifest themselves and how people understand the earth. Even if they don't know, they understand them because it gives a very interesting movie and think about it, don't you? You might ask. Well, with modern people, think about people going to church. They think, how can people believe those foolish, those superstitions.

Speaker 7:          00:48:03       Fair enough. Well, what the hell do you think you're doing when you were moving? What are you doing here? Here you are. You're family. You probably haven't seen Nokia lately, but whatever you're an adult, you bring your five year old to seem to know you're just as interest as he is and think about what you're doing. First of all, you know those are drawings. They're not real creatures. There draws second pot wouldn't pop up. Who actually happens to wander around who is being guided to life. Quite cricket was highest goal is to for recent snow onto and understand and somehow that makes a fairy tournament to something that's real. It's like that's strange people. The fact that you're doing that is very peculiar and it says something about what people are like means that we understand the things that we don't normally understand and so it's.

Speaker 7:          00:48:54       It's a very interesting movie. I can tell you what it's fundamental presupposition is I'll just guide you through it very, very rapidly. So the beginning of the movie, Japan, who's, who's, uh, the archetype of the good father, by the way, which is an archetype that we forgot about us because our culture isn't just a tyrannical patriarchy as you can tell by the fact that farm and comfortable and we're not tearing each other to shreds at the moment, which is what you do in a state of absolute chaos, right? It's made him on. You're freezing and starving, right? And that is what one have. We have a piece and it's rare and it's amazing that we have, we shouldn't take it for granted because it's not the normal order of things. The normal order of things is destructive chaos. And if you're fortunate enough to live somewhere that's peaceful, productive, you should thank your lucky stars every second of your life. And if you don't do that, all that means is that you don't know anything about history and you know nothing about human beings because things can get out smoothly, monster. And it happens all the time and there's always a fraction of the population who thinks that's how they like things to be and perhaps there's a fraction of you have. It's like that too. And I wouldn't nurture that fragment pharmacy you unless you want to go. We're equal taking. Anyways, back to

Speaker 6:          00:50:12       thank you,

Speaker 7:          00:50:20       and then you can tell that he's got a warm house and it's full of toys and it's full of music boxes and the goldfish. He takes care of them and so it's a good guy. It makes this pop and then he puts us on the puppet and that's the final act and the public can have its capacity to speak. And that's what you want. If you're a good father because you want to take your son and turn them into someone who can speak right, who can speak his soul and soldier battle, puts a smile on his son space and says, wouldn't it be wonderful if he could be a good boy sweater? Yeah. Wouldn't it be wonderful, right? Because that's what you're doing. You're a good father. You think, wouldn't it be possible that this puppet could actually become something genuine and independent with its own voice?

Speaker 7:          00:51:06       While he says that sounds likely it goes off to bed and then the star appears up in the window and the wishes on the scar and you think, what does that mean? What does it mean to wish on a star? It's like, well, the star is that light that gets into the darkness, right, and it's something transcendent. You go show up into the night sky and it's. It's odd inspiring whether you're religious or not. You're looking into the incident while you make a relationship with the infinite. By wishing on a star, you raise your eyes above the horizon and point at the light that shines in the darkness and you say, I wish more than anything else that my son can become a real person. So that's what you do. If you're a good for the water may come into a slave. You don't want to be a tyrant.

Speaker 7:          00:51:49       You don't want them to be a puppet. You want them to be something as strong and independent. Also, Pinocchio goes out into the world. He faces all these different moral problems. He's armed with his conscience. It turns up to the other bug, right? Well, why? Well, it's because things bug you. You know you're conscious bugs you and the reason that the conscience is jimminy cricket is because that's the same initials as Jesus Christ and Jimminy cricket is southern US slime for Jesus Christ and no doubt the other mangers thought that was very comical. I'm not telling you that that is a very strange representation of Christ. That's for sure. It would make it into a cricketer and he is also rather error prone in the movie because the movie doesn't have besides the affordable Christian structure. But part of the reason this took me a long time to figure out too is that you have to have a dialogue with your conscience, but it has to be a dog because it's actually not 100 percent right.

Speaker 7:          00:52:42       It has to be something that you build by having a discussion with it across time. And that's actually where Pinocchio, junior cricket, as the movie progresses, both the puppet and the conscience get wiser by begging themselves against the world. And the pop and house to resist the temptation of Isi, fame and celebrity. That's the first temptation, right? Because he's asked to be an actor, which is an easy way to be celebrities like the Kardashians, right? It's it's status without responsibility or or competence and so that that exists and the traffic and then he's, he's. He learns that lying is a very bad idea, right? That's what he's knows. Grocery has to get that sort of know. And then he said he's asked to present himself as a victim of circumstances. That's what the Fox and the coyotes and when he decides that he's too ill to go back to school, they take them to pleasure.

Speaker 7:          00:53:33       It varies trained to be a jackass that works for slavers into soul lines. Right? Not Bad for animation, I could say. And then at the end of it, the leaky tries to go back home because he's terribly lost in these half. Jack asked because the people that pleasure island have told him, taught him to do nothing but break, which I can't help it offers or what would you. What would you say is, is an appalling parallel to what's happening to educate people who are being educated in modern universities, which are increasingly play houses where you're taught to break in the listen, I can't listen to the protesters. It just, it just. It's just painful. It's this constant repetition of a soul. Nonsense thank loudly chanted is because the protesters, they're trying to convince themselves even more desperately than they're trying to convince them.

Speaker 7:          00:54:35       So anyways, Pinocchio goes back home and half jackass in half again and trust to find his father. There's no going home right now. Once you're an adult, it's your young adult. You don't get to go back because there isn't anyone there that can tell you what to do anymore, and so they go as far as fair and finds out that he has to go to the bottom of chaos itself to rescue his father and that's what we have to do, right? Because our civilization is in a state of crisis now is predicted long ago by people like Dj. And partly what you're trying to do with you go to university is to go to the heart of therapist right to the place that terrifies you the most, and to find your values, your culture really has, and that's what it means to go down to the bottom of the desk to the thing that terrifies you the most integrative before your father to very little story.

Speaker 7:          00:55:21       The Egyptians were telling that story for a thousand years ago. It's one of the oldest stories of mankind, and so that's what you have to do. You and the United Yourself with your culture so that you're more than just a weakened symbol minded individual, right? You dedicate yourself to the study of what's great about the past and you incorporate it so that there can be something to you and then you bring your father back up to the surface so that the culture can see and live in yet, and then that makes you into a real individual. Well, that's the movie. Well, we watch it were captivated by it. Now it's time to understand. It takes time to understand that in an articulated and conscious map because it's too late for us to be unconscious anymore. And so we have stella and shrimp, this, we have the chaos of the left and the left says, well we need to tear down structures because they own press.

Speaker 7:          00:56:11       So like obviously instructors who oppressed because something's good at the top of the structure and also good at the bottom. So if you have any values dropped, it's going to privilege some things and exclude others, but if you scrap structures and there's nothing to live for, so we can't do that. That's just chaos. And then the radical right says back to the nation and it's like really? You know, we went back to the nation a couple of times so it doesn't really look that great. And part of the reason for that is that the purpose of the nation isn't the nation. The purpose of the nation is to produce citizens who transcend Emma juvenate, the nation. And so the nation should be probably properly subordinated to the individual, right to the divine individually for that map. And that's what we figured out in the West.

Speaker 7:          00:56:56       Now it is that we only figured that out in the west, but so far we've been fortunate enough to put it into a reasonable practice in our political institutions and thank God for that. At least it's worked somewhere and we'd be completely foolish to give that up because look at what it's provided us with. Its remarkable for free, as free as we can, but that doesn't mean that we're happy because freedom and happiness are not the same thing at all. But we did figure out what the state should be subordinate to the wisdom of the individual, to the site and the wisdom of the individual that puts a heavy responsibility on everyone. That mean to you have to be the individual who can see at speed. That's your job. And if you do that, the thing that's so cool about that is you know you need a meaning in your life that enables you to bear the suffering of their life without becoming corrupted.

Speaker 7:          00:57:47       That's the basic rule and you have to build yourself into something that you can actually respect so that you can see yourself bearing not terrible existential burger properly and then you don't lose hope and you don't use meaning because you can see that you're strong enough to stand up underneath that Burger and then there's something about you that you can respect and then maybe other people can respect that will help bring suffering in the world to an end and that will help people develop fully as individuals and that will enable us to avoid the dehumanizing rigid. A I'll uniformity of the nationalistic lack and appalling devouring chaos of the radical left. How about no

Speaker 8:          00:58:34       the individual

Speaker 7:          00:58:36       that's the secret to the world and you're all individuals. You're all the secret to the world and then all you have to do to discover that is picked up responsibility. Stop listening to people who keep burdening you with rights. How many Goddamn rights deal? Why you need some responsibility? So pick it up, open your eyes and learn how to make yourself articulate, and that made the world one sentence of a series of health than it already descended into the 20th century.

Speaker 9:          00:59:14       You've think detailed what you think students shouldn't do in these examples of like protests and these examples of certain types of activist tactics. What advice would you have for students? How can students make the changes that they want to make? Particularly? Do you have any advice for students here? Yeah. Read great books. Really, man, you've got this four year period that has been carved out of your lives by society. They given you an identity, like a high quality identity and freedom at the same time and you're not going to get that again in your life. You've got a. you've got a respectable identity, university student and complete freedom associated with that or as near as you're ever going to get and you've got these unbelievable libraries that are full of the writings of people who are, who are intelligent and articulate beyond comprehension and you know, and and you can go there and you can learn all this and you might think, well, why should you learn it while you learn it to get a job?

Speaker 9:          01:00:09       Or you learn it to get good grades or you learn it to get a degree and that's all nonsense. It's nonsense. The reason that you come to university to be educated is because there is nothing more powerful than someone who is articulate and who can think and speak. It's power and power of the best, sort of its authority and influence and respectability and competence. And so you come to university to craft your highest skill and your highest skill is to be found in articulated speech. And if you're, if you're, if you're a master at formulating your arguments, you win everything and better than that, when you win everything, everyone around you wins too. Because to transform yourself into, let's consider, consider your transformation into something approximating the logos. It means you shine a light on the whole world. Well, there's nothing more exciting to do than that.

Speaker 9:          01:00:58       There's nothing better you can possibly do. And to think that you're going to university to be trained to have a job, it's like great. That's a hell of a lot better than being unemployed and covered with cheeto dust while you're snacking away in front of your video game in the basement, but it's not. It's not a. and I don't have anything against video games by the way, but it's hardly a triumphant call to, to being in the world. And that's what universities should be calling forth. It's like God, you people, you as you know I, I know what Harvard students are like. I taught here for five years. You people are spectacular. You're spectacular. You're, you're, you're, you're all capable of being world beaters. You transform yourself into something that's articulated and sensible and grounded in history and knowledgeable and wise man, you can do anything you want and hopefully anything you want for good because if you have any sense, everything you want to do would be for the good because there's nothing more compelling or meaningful or or useful in combating the tragedy of life than to than to struggle with all your soul on behalf of the good and the university hasn't forgotten that.

Speaker 9:          01:02:04       It's why everyone's bailing out of the humanities and they should. The humanities are corrupt and they're corrupt because they're not telling the students this. It's so bloody obvious. So like learn to think, learn to speak, let to read. It makes you a super power and the individual superpower you have it under. I don't understand why that isn't just told to students. It's not that hard to understand and everyone wants to hear it. It's like, really? I could do that. I can do that. It's like, yeah, really you could do that, and the whole society around you is labored for really thousands of years to provide every single one of you with this spectacular opportunity that you have while your undergraduates and graduate students here. Man, they're just. Everyone's just praying that you would come here and manifest everything that you could manifest and that's what you should be doing. Instead of waving placards and complaining about how you're oppressed for God's sake, you see these Yale students complaining about their oppression. It's just, it just leaves me aghast and it's like, well, we're against the ruling class. It's like, no, no, no. Your baby ruling class members. You're young.

Speaker 6:          01:03:15       Thank you.

Speaker 9:          01:03:21       The only reason you're not rich just because you're young, you know that's the best. Really. That's the. If you look at the one percent, even the dreaded one percent, you know, most of those people are old. Why? Well, when you progress through life, if you're reasonably successful, you trade in your promising youth for your wealthy old age, but you're still bloody old. Were you, when you trade it, would you trade your youth for that? Like if you factor age out of the economic equation, things look a lot different. Well, of course older people have more money. If they have any sense they'd been collecting it for their whole life. Is that somehow unfair? It's not unfair unless you want to want to be poverty stricken when you're 70 and you and you don't want to be poverished strict poverty stricken when you're 70. So I just don't understand what's happened to the universities.

Speaker 9:          01:04:08       I can't believe that you're not told when you come the first day, look, man, you are, you're here on a heroic mission. You're going to take your capacity to articulate yourself to levels that are undreamed of you're going to come out of here unstoppable. You're going to be able to do anything you want. It's like, that's what you're here for. Instead, you're taught that, well, you know the world's a pretty oppressive place and you're probably the bottom of the victim pile. And, and, and, and there's, and there's, there's virtually nothing you can do about it except, you know, deconstruct the patriarchy. And it's so neat and so pathetic that the university should be embarrassed that that's what they're peddling to students. I'm embarrassed by it. You know, I've, I've gone on public record telling parents what do you well, send your boys to trade school because at least they'll learn something useful and that's a terrible thing for someone like me to say because I do believe that the are being articulated and educated in the highest possible manner is there's nothing that's better for you and for society.

Speaker 9:          01:05:06       And why or why have the university's forgotten this? Well, that's postmodern neo Marxism for you. You know that. Then the philosophy of intense resentment and oppression and group identity and god, it's just pathetic. Dr Susan. I think a lot of students here would agree with you that one of the main purposes of education and college, particularly at Harvard, is to develop their sense of articulation, their ability to read, their ability to create a critically think. But then what comes after, particularly at Harvard, there's a big discussion on what is a good life, what does it mean to use those skills that we get here? And then we graduate. What do we do from there, I stopped unnecessary suffering. That's what you do. You know that that's your calling. It's like you say, well, what do you do after you graduate? Well, if you graduate, articulated and powerful, there will be people giving you so many opportunities.

Speaker 9:          01:06:02       You won't even be able to keep up with them. You know, and I've worked with very, very competent people in many different domains in my life. Hyper competent people. And I can tell you some very interesting things about hyper competent people. The first thing is they are not selfish and they're not greedy and one of the great pleasures in their lives is to find people who have the capacity to also be hyper competent and to open doors for them as rapidly as they can possibly be opened. They delight in that because there is. There's nothing there. There's very few things that are more intrinsically meaningful. If you're an accomplished person, then to find young people who have the possibility of being accomplished and say, hey look, here's an opportunity for you. It's like, go out there, man, kill it. And then they go out there and kill it.

Speaker 9:          01:06:43       You think right on, man, here's another opportunity to go ahead. Go there near that to new think. No, no. They're all hurting their wealth and they're not going to share it with anyone. It's like that's absolute complete rubbish. So you don't even have to worry about what you're going to do after you graduate from here. If you, if you turn yourself into half of what you could be, because people will be dying to offer you every opportunity that you can possibly make use of. So it's, it's, it's a moot point. The, the, the world is always desperately short of people who can think and speak and, and you think, well, I won't be made use of. Well first of all, you can't say that if you're at. If you're at Harvard for God's sake, I mean people already figured out who you are. They've already figured it out and they're offering you the world on a, on a golden platter.

Speaker 9:          01:07:27       It take it, it's yours. Take it. So like, great man. Pull yourself together and deserve. That would be great. And that's what everyone wants. It's what your parents want. It's also what you want. You know it. It's what you want. It's what men. It's what women want from men. It's what men want from women. It's like for you to be who you could be, and then the highest faculty of the human being is articulated speech. It's the divine faculty and there is nothing more powerful than that. There was nothing that's even in the same league, and so if you. If you don't have faith in that than your, then your priorities are misplaced and I can't even understand why you wouldn't have faith in that being, say, Harvard students because look where it's got you already know you're already sitting on top of the world, so make deserve it.

Speaker 9:          01:08:15       Make use of it, right? Go out there and fix things up. That's what you need to do. There's lots of things that need to be fixed up and what do you want to do is burden yourself with so much responsibility that you can barely stand and then you'll get stronger trying to lift it up and you'll be. Won't be asking what should I be doing with my life or what's the meaning of life or any of that. It will be self evident and self evident at minimum you can say there's more suffering in the world than there should be and I could probably do something about that and you can do something about that, so go do something about it and then there'll be less suffering in the world and then when you're 80 you can look back on your life and say, well, you know, there's less suffering in the world than there would have been had.

Speaker 9:          01:08:54       I know it existed and and you don't have to even have a sense of, of ultimate destiny or even any sort of theistic belief to regard that as a positive good. Like I think it goes beyond the mere pragmatic utility of addressing the world's ails because I think we do live in a, in a, in a world that has a transcendent reality as well as the reality that we can detect, but even independently of fat, it doesn't matter. It's like. I mean, this is part of the reason I like people like Bill Gates is a great example, man. That guy is. He's after five major diseases at the same time. Right? He's trying to wipe out polio. He's trying to wipe out malaria. Yeah, exactly. He's trying to wipe out malaria. It's like, well, what should you do with your life? Well, you know, take a look at Bill Gates and see if you could do something like that. That would be good.

Speaker 9:          01:09:43       So. So Dr Peterson, you talked about this idea of ending unnecessary suffering and this idea of committing one's life to that at a minimum. That's the minimum thing that you could do. A lot of students, I think accept that premise and view what they're doing as trying to eliminate or reduce unnecessary suffering and they see activism or other forms of direct service as fulfilling that goal. Do you simply disagree with the content of what they think the tactic that they are using to end unnecessary suffering or do you think that their motives or their intentions are not even the same as yours?

Speaker 9:          01:10:26       Arts to public? You know, there's this, there's this, there's this old saying from the, from the new testament about not praying in public, right, and now idea is that if you're going to commune for the higher good, you should do it in private because otherwise you're warping your ethic in some sense by demonstrating how virtuous you virtuous you are to the world. It's like, you know, you go out there with a stick and a sign on it that says I'm against poverty. It's like, yeah, no kidding. That's really like for poverty, poverty, so it's, it's, it's, it's an abdication of responsibility with the mask of social virtue and you want to solve difficult problems. You've figured out how to get along with your brother, the one you've been fighting with for five years or see if you can staple your family back together. See if you can stop fighting with your girlfriend and have a relationship that lasts for more than two weeks.

Speaker 9:          01:11:13       You know, it's like there are things that you should be doing in the confines of your own life that are private and humble. That would, would, that would constitute genuine accomplishments. And those are the things that you should attend to and no one's going to come along and say, hey, you know, good job, you're, you're changing the world because it's private, but it's real and people don't do that. And so no, I don't, I don't trust the activist. I don't trust the activist ethos at all. I think it, I think everything about it is, is superficial and, and trendy and, and too easy. And, and the externalizes the blame, the evil is always elsewhere, which is a dreadful mistake to make because the evil isn't elsewhere. That's, that's the thing that you understand when you're wise is the evil is not elsewhere. It's you because you're not everything you could be.

Speaker 9:          01:12:06       And so, you know, you should work on that before going in telling someone else that maybe they're not who they should be. So I think it's, you know, so I don't buy it. It's too easy. It's far too easy and it's too public and it's too self congratulatory. And then there's the murderous, like Marxist element, which I'm always often inclined to mention. So certainly I think you've identified certain causes where the public element or the self congratulatory time to do good could be harmful, but do you think there are cases, for instance, I'm thinking of policy influencing policy being a policymaker. It seems like something like that public policy could be used to eliminate some unnecessary suffering but would involve a more public domain, something where you are trying to attract followers, trying to attract praise from other people. Look, look, if you, if you've established yourself in the world as a credible human being and people are asking you to enter public service because of your accomplishments, then it's time to do it right?

Speaker 9:          01:13:10       But before that it's a little on the premature side and if you're just setting your for self forward as an Avatar of an idea of an ideology, then there's nothing to you except I think of it as the chattering of various forms of demons. It's like you're not helpful and if you. If you look, you want to think, okay, are you fit to lead? Let's, let's put it that way. Okay. First of all, do you know where you're going? Because that's actually one of the hallmarks of a leader. Leader knows where he's going and maybe other people are also interested in going that way, but the leaders I've met have carved themselves out a personal vision, right? It's not some. It's not some cookie cutter ideological solution to the ills of the planet. They've done a detailed analysis, right? They know what they're talking about and they're usually people.

Speaker 9:          01:13:54       They've had a successful relationship, they've had a successful family, they have a couple of degrees. They've established a business like they've made themselves credible in five or six dimensions. Well then maybe you know enough about the world to dare to mess with its internal mechanisms, and if you. If you don't have that kind of in depth, then you should just. You shouldn't. You should know more work on the economic systems of Western civilization. Then you should try to adjust the electronic systems of your automobile because the latter is far less complex than the former. So of course there's utility in policy formulation and in, in government service and in all of those sorts of things. But you have to. You have to have transformed yourself at least to some degree, into someone who's actually competent before you should even dare to do such things. You think, well, I have read some marks and now I know how to change the world. That's a very bad idea because the probability that you're going to take something complex that doesn't work too badly and fix it with your idiotic intervention is zero. So

Speaker 6:          01:14:58       hmm. Well put

Speaker 10:         01:15:10       the chaos is hiding in what's irrelevant and so, and that's very interesting observation because since the chaos is virtually infinite, it's a real questions. Where the hell do you put it while you put it in what you ignore and you can ignore it as long as it isn't actively interfering with your movement forward, you can assume that it's that it doesn't matter that it doesn't matter that it doesn't matter. Same thing. All right, so here's the kicker. There's one more class of things that you can run into along the way and this is where the chaos breaks through. So let's say

Speaker 10:         01:15:52       you're moving from point a to point b and something that you don't expect occurs and it gets in the way. So let's say that you're living with someone and maybe you kind of like them, you're not married so you don't like them that much because otherwise you'd ask them to marry you. But anyways. Um, and so had quarter view is looking for something better in three quarters view is half satisfied, something like that. And then a person because we're ambivalent about such things. And then the person you discover or the person announces that they've been having an affair. Okay. So then how are you supposed to respond emotionally to that? Well, the part of you that wasn't all that committed to the relationship is kind of exhilarated by that. And then the three quarters of you that's half satisfied is hurt and, and you're going to exploit that part for sure in the ensuing discussions and not mention the, oh, that's kind of exciting that you've betrayed me that way.

Speaker 10:         01:16:48       So, so, but the point is, is that you, that's a whole. Now what's happened is a whole has you have this structure that you're walking on ice, like the thin ice that you're skating on and now there's a hole in it and the whole. We don't even know how deep the hole is, but you know there's a hole there and so now you're anxious. It. Oh, they'll maybe also a little bit excited because God only knows what's down there, but but you don't know what to do with that whole because it could spread very badly on you. It could be that you know the whole relationship was a facade and that all your relationships have been facades, facades, and that the reason that is is because you're so damn shallow that it's impossible for you to have a relationship that isn't just a facade and that's partly because you don't pay any attention to other people.

Speaker 10:         01:17:35       And it's also partly because you're malevolent and selfish. So that's a nasty thing to discover. Or maybe that's the sort of person that you're attracting. Which would make sense actually if that's the sort of person that you are. And so. So there are certain things that you can encounter that basically unglue you, and what happens is that those moments of being unglued travel up that entire hierarchy of presuppositions. It's like because the one of the logical conclusions to being betrayed in a relationship is that you are, that you're truly a bad person. Now another equally logical conclusion is that the person that you're with is really a bad person. And another logical conclusion is all people are truly bad people. You know, I mean in, in, in macro ways that in microwaves you can't trust anyone. You can't trust women. You can't trust men. You can't trust human beings. You can't trust yourself. The whole place is a catastrophe. It's a nightmare. Well then you can fall through into chaos. Now the way your body responds to that, when something or maybe you know you're supposed to be getting a promotion at work, that's good. You're all chipper about the promotion at work and you walk into your boss's office because he or she wants to see you and they say, well, you know, we've reviewed your performance over the last few years and your performance has been somewhere between mediocre and decent and we're downsizing and see later.

Speaker 10:         01:19:05       That's not a raise or a promotion, that's for sure. That's a whole that you fall into and the question is, well, what do you make of that? Right. How do you frame that? How do you take that emergent chaos and make habitable order out of. You don't know. Is the whole capitalist system rotten to the core? I mean, that's a convenient explanation under those circumstances, that's for sure. Where you're working for a psychopathic son of a bitch. Did you make the wrong choice in university and was that your father's fault because you never did what you wanted or was it your fault for not standing up to them or is it a dying industry or is maybe this is a wake up call that you should go do something else that you've been waiting to. Do you know that you've actually wanted to do your whole life and that's why you're doing such a miserable job at your current occupation because you're bitter and resentful about the fact that you never did what you want.

Speaker 10:         01:19:54       You don't know. It's all of those things at once and that's very stressful because all of those things at once is too many things and that's the reemergence of chaos. That's the flood. That's the return to the beginning of the cosmos. That's another way that it's been represented. Mythologically stayed. You voyage all the way back to the beginning of the cosmos when there's nothing but undifferentiated chaos and that's what you're confronting and maybe it's too much for you and often it is. I mean that that can really. That can be traumatizing. It can hurt your brain. You know, it's just too much for you to bear, but it doesn't matter. You're stuck with it. And so how do you respond to that? Well, some of it is catastrophic, negative emotion. You freeze and that's protective and maybe you don't even want to move. You don't want to bloody well get out of bed for a week and that's because your body is reacting as if the bedroom floor is covered with snakes and the best thing for you to do is just not move, just freeze.

Speaker 10:         01:20:50       Not a pleasant situation to be in because it's your aroused, very, very physiologically demanding, and there's zero about it that's productive except maybe the snakes won't see you, but they've already seen you, so that isn't helping very well. So you've got all this undifferentiated nadir, negative emotion, anxiety, fear, hurt, anger, guilt, shame, emotional pain, the whole plethora of catastrophes. And then maybe on the other side lurking down there is, thank God I'm done with that job. I just bloody well hated. I dragged myself off to work every day and there's a little part of my soul that so goddamn happy. I finally got fired that I can hardly stand it. You know, and maybe you don't even admit that to yourself because well, that would mean that all that time you spent at the job was just sunk costs. You're deluding yourself the whole time on.

Speaker 10:         01:21:37       It is an interesting thing to consider those sometimes if you're in the unpleasant circumstance of having to fire someone, you know, sometimes firing someone is the best thing that can happen to them, which doesn't mean that you should go out and like enjoy it. Although I have met very disagreeable people who actually enjoyed firing people and I'll tell you a story about that at some point because it's quite interesting, but you know, sometimes if someone's just limping along in their job and doing it as miserably in wretchedly as they possibly can imagine, the best thing you can do to them for them is to say, you know, you're failing at this and, and that doesn't necessarily mean that you would have to be failing at absolutely everything else in the entire world. So maybe you should just accept the dam failure and go off and try something new. And I mean that's terrifying for people and I know they hate it and all that, but, but, but sometimes it's better than the alternative, which is just slow torturous death.

Speaker 11:         01:22:37       No, the idea of dream analysis, I suppose it's one of Freud's perhaps Freud's major contribution to modern western thought. The idea was there was something to dreams and I suppose what I did is said, hey look, isn't it strange we have this whole other form of thought that we engage in at night it and it speaks in the language that we don't really understand and so what the hell is that? And you can say many modern people

Speaker 12:         01:23:05       do dreams are of no significance or even that they're random processes, which is an absurd proposition obviously because they're by Terrell, whatever they are, they're obviously not random. So. So Freud's idea was that there was some something in dreams that was informative, so that's his. Now he had a method for describe for extracting out from the dream what dream purported to represent and he outlined that in great detail in the interpretation of dreams and if you want to read one book by Freud, I would highly recommend that when it's a very long book and it's very detailed, but for a desert extraordinarily comprehensive analysis of the way that dreams work. Now he made the because because he had brought a theoretical framework to bear, even on his investigation into dream structure, he concluded that dreams were essentially wish fulfillments, and that's where young and Freud disagreed.

Speaker 12:         01:24:01       He also believed that the primary motivating factor of human beings with sexual, and now that's a tougher one to toss aside because even if you're a Darwinian, rather than afraid, Ian, you're going to obviously support the proposition that sexual motivation among any living creature is going to be one of the highest order motivations because otherwise creatures don't reproduce and and prevail over the long run. So the question is, is that is that the ultimate source of motivation? And in some sense the answer to that has to be yes. Well, Freud wanted to make that in some ways the sole source of motivation, and I'm oversimplifying and I hate to do that in relationship to Freud because he was not as simple minded character young. How to dream once, if I remember correctly, that Freud and jung were excavating a basement. And so freud had outlined in Freud had already discovered the basement, let's say.

Speaker 12:         01:24:56       So that would be the unconscious structure of the psyche and young broke through into another basement that was a multi chambered place. So many, many, many rooms and I suppose what drove young and freud apart was the proposition that there was a hell of a lot more going down, going on down there. Then had already met the eye and they broke on the idea that the sexual impulse was primary, roughly speaking, they broke when you wrote a book called symbols of transformation, which is actually. There's, there's three books that I know of that are sort of like maps of meaning. One is symbols of transformation. One is a book by Eric Norman called the origins and history of consciousness. And the third and the third one, while his maps of meaning, they're the same book. They're just like, they're trying to solve the same problem from three different directions. They're all attempts to address the same problem. And so symbols of transformation was a book that you wrote about the fantasies of schizophrenia, a American woman, and he was. He was trying to relate her fantasies to these old mythological ideas and young's idea. Essentially, and this is an idea that was shared by people like piaget, so we

Speaker 11:         01:26:04       were not going to say that you and Freud just pulled this idea out of the air, was that the the birthplace of myth, mythology and literature for that matter was the dream that that they share structural, they share, they share, they share what mode of information presentation and it's a relatively radical hypothesis, but, but given that they both, they both represent

Speaker 8:          01:26:43       hm

Speaker 11:         01:26:45       dreams, dreams and mythological representations share and essentially narrative structure and they use their literary like you know, I mean it's not so unreasonable to notice that a dream at night is like the movie that you play in your head and it's not unreasonable to note as well that the dreams that you have at night bear a relationship to the daydreams that you have during the day. It's a form of cognition. It seems like an involuntary form of cognition though. And that's a very strange thing. So young thought about the dream as nature, speaking of its own accord, roughly speaking. And so his idea was, well, when you, when you sleep, you dream, but the dream happens to you. It's not something that you create the way that you don't even think about creating it, because I might say, well, what are you thinking about? And you'll say, I'm thinking about whatever it is, and you'll take credit in some sense for thinking that because it seems like a voluntary activity, but what happens at night is that you think, but you think involuntarily and so what young would say is that means that something is thinking in you and that's a perfectly reasonable way of looking at it and this is one of the things that's uncanny about the cycle analysts as they were willing to take their observations to their logical conclusion.

Speaker 11:         01:27:55       There are things that think in you. What are those things and what are they thinking and why are they thinking it? Now, if you do dream analysis, and this is a tricky thing because who's to say if your damn analysis is correct? Right? It's very difficult to understand that if you. If you do dream analysis with someone, you generally have them lay out their dream and then you ask them when they're going through their dream of second time, they lay out their dream and you can kind of get a picture of it, and then they lay out their dream a second time and as they go through it, every time they mentioned a detail or a character, you ask them what that reminds them of and the hypothesis is that the dream is presenting an image or an idea that's associated with a network of ideas and then if you can expand on the network of ideas as you go through the dream, you can elaborate on the dream. You can expand it upwards and you can start to see what it might be attempting to put forward. Now. Freud's idea was that the dream knew what it was doing, but that its content was being suppressed and oppressed by an internal sensor. The dream had to be

Speaker 12:         01:29:02       sneaky about what it was saying because it was going to deliver a message that the person didn't want to hear. That that was tied up with his idea of repression, but that's not young's idea. See, young's idea was different. He said, no, no. The dream is trying to tell you what is trying to tell you as clear as it can. That's just the best it can do, and so you could think of the dream, and this is I believe, the right way to think about it. The dream is the birthplace of thought. The same way that artists are the birthplace of culture. It's exactly the same process. It's that your mind is groping outward to try to comprehend what it has not yet comprehended and it does that first by trying to map it on to image and it's doing that in the dream and it's somewhat incoherent and and, and well, let's stick with coherent because it's not yet a full fledge thought. It's the birthplace of thought. It's a fantasy about what might be, and then if you can grip the fantasy and share it with other people, then maybe they can elaborate upon it and bring it into being with more clarity than it would be if it merely existed. As the precursor of a thought in your imagination,

Speaker 13:         01:30:14       do you know if you take people and I've told you this and you expose them voluntarily to things that they are avoiding and are afraid of, you know, that they know they need to overcome in order to meet their goals, their self defined goals. If you can teach people to stand up in the face of the things they're afraid of, they get stronger and you don't know what the upper limits to that are because you might ask yourself like if for 10 years if you didn't avoid doing what you knew you needed to do by the depth, by your own definitions, right? Within the value structure that you've created, to the degree that you've done that, what would you be like?

Speaker 13:         01:30:49       Well, you know, there are remarkable people who come into the world from time to time and there are people who do find out over decades long periods what they could be like if they were who they were. If they said if they spoke their being forward and they get stronger and stronger and stronger and we don't know the limits to that. We do not know the limits to that, and so you could say, well, in part perhaps the reason that you're suffering unbearably can be left at your feet because you're not everything you could be and you know it, and of course that's a terrible thing to admit and it's a terrible thing to consider, but there's real promise in it, right? Because it means that

Speaker 13:         01:31:27       perhaps there's another way that you could look at the world and the number another way that you could act in the world. So what it would reflect back to you would be much better than what it reflects back to you now. And then the second part of that is, well, imagine that many people did that because we've done a lot as human beings. We've done a lot of remarkable things and I told you already, I think before that today, for example, about 250,000 people will be lifted out of abject poverty and about 300,000 people attached to the electrical power grid. We're making. People were lifting people out of collectively at a faster rate that's ever occurred in the history of humankind by a huge margin and that's been going on unbelievably quickly since the year 2000. The UN employee plan to have poverty between 2000 and 2015 and it was accomplished by 2013.

Speaker 13:         01:32:16       So there's inequality developing in many places and you hear lots of political agitation about that. But overall the tide is lifting everyone up and now it's a great thing. We have no idea how fast we can multiply that if people got their act together and really aimed at it. Because, you know, my, my experience is with people that were probably running at about 51 percent of our capacity. Something mean you can think about this yourselves. I often ask undergraduates how many hours a day you waste or how many hours a week you waste. The classic answer is something like four to six hours a day, you know, inefficient studying, uh, watching things on youtube that not only do you not want to watch, that you don't even care about that make you feel horrible about watching. After you're done, that's probably four hours right there. Now you think, well that's 20, 25 hours a week.

Speaker 13:         01:33:05       It's 100 hours a month. That's two and a half full work weeks. It's half a year of work weeks per year. And if your time is worth $20 an hour, which is a radical underestimate. It's probably more like 50. If you think about it in terms of deferred wages, if you're wasting 20 hours a week, you're wasting $50,000 a year and you are doing that right now and it's because you're young wasting $50,000 a year as a way bigger catastrophe then it would be for me to waste it because I'm not going to last nearly as long. And so if your life isn't everything, it could be. You could ask yourself, well, what would happen if you just stopped wasting the opportunities that are in front of you? You be who knows how much more efficient, 10 times more efficient, 20 times more efficient. That's the prieto distribution. You have no idea how efficient, efficient people get.

Speaker 13:         01:33:54       It's completely. It's off the charts well, and if we all got our act together collectively and stopped making things worse because that's another thing people do all the time. Not only do they not do what they should to make things better, they actively attempt to make things worse because they're spiteful or resentful or arrogant or deceitful or or homicidal or genocidal or all of those things all bundled together in an absolutely pathological package. If people stopped really, really trying just to make things worse, we have no idea how much better they would get just because of that. So there's this weird dynamic that's part of the existential system of ideas between human vulnerability, social judgment, both of which are are, are, are major causes of suffering and the failure of individuals to adopt the responsibility that they know they should adopt. And that's the thing that's interesting too, is that like one of the, another thing I've asked often asked my undergraduate classes, you know, there's this idea that people have that people have a conscience

Speaker 13:         01:35:01       and you know what the conscience is. It's, it's this feeling or voice you have in your head just before you do something that you know, is stupid, telling you that probably you shouldn't do that stupid thing. You don't have to listen to it strangely enough, but you go ahead and do it anyways. And then of course exactly what the conscience told you was going to happen inevitably happens so that you feel even stupider about it than you would if it happened by accident. Because, you know, I knew this was going to happen, I got a warning it was going to happen and I went and did it anyways. And the funny thing too is that that conscience operates within people and we really don't understand what the hell that is.

Speaker 13:         01:35:40       So you might say, well, what would happen if you abided by your conscience for five years or for 10 years? What sort of position might you be in? What sort of family might you have? What sort of relationship might you be able to forge and you can be bloody sure that a relationship that's forged on the basis of who you actually are is going to be a lot stronger and more welcome than one that's forged on the basis of who you aren't. Now, of course, that means that the person you're with has to deal with the full force of you in all your ability and your catastrophe, and that's a very, very difficult thing to negotiate, but if you do negotiate it well, at least you, you have something, you have somewhere solid to stand and you have somewhere to live. You have a real life and it's a great basis upon which to bring children into the world, for example, because you can have an actual relationship with them instead of torturing them half to death, which is what happens in a tremendous, a tremendously large minority of cases.

Speaker 13:         01:36:38       Well, it's more than that too because, and this is what I'll close with and this is why I wanted to introduce social knutson's readings to you. You see, because it isn't merely that your fate depends on whether or not you get your act together and to what degree you decide that you're going to live out your own genuine being. It isn't only your fate, it's the fate of everyone that you're networked with and so you know, you think, well, there's 9 billion, 7 billion people in the world. We're going to peak at about 9 billion by the way, and then it'll decline rapidly, but 7 billion people in the world and who are you? You're just one little dust mote among that 7 billion, and so it really doesn't matter what you do or don't do, but that's simply not the case. It's the wrong model because you're at the center of a network.

Speaker 13:         01:37:23       You're a node in a network. Of course that's even more true now that we have social media. You'll, you'll know a thousand people at least over the course of your life and they'll know a thousand people each and that puts you one person away from a million and two persons away from a billion, and so that's how you're connected and the things you do. They're like dropping a stone in a pond. The ripples move outward and they effect things in ways that you can't fully comprehend and it means that the things that you do and that you don't do are far more important than you think, and so if you act that way, of course, the terror of realizing that is that it actually starts to matter what you do and you might say, well, that's better than living a meaningless existence. It's better for it to matter, but I mean if you really asked yourself, would you be so sure if you had the choice?

Speaker 13:         01:38:10       I can live with no responsibility whatsoever. The price I pay is that nothing matters or I can reverse it and everything matters, but I have to take the responsibility that's associated with that. It's not so obvious to me that people would take the meaningful path. No. When you say, well, nihilists suffer dreadfully because there's no meaning in their life and they still suffer. Yeah, but the advantages, they have no responsibility. So that's the payoff and I actually think that's the motivation. Say, well, I can't help being nihilistic. All my belief systems have collapsed. It's like, yeah, maybe. Maybe you've just allowed them to collapse because it's a hell of a lot easier than acting them out and the price you pay is a meaningless suffering, but you can always whining about that and people will feel sorry for you and you have the option of taking the pathway of the martyr so that's a pretty good deal.

Speaker 13:         01:38:55       All things considered, especially when the when the alternative is to bear your burden properly and to live forthrightly in the world. Well, what SOS units and figured out in so many people in the 20th century, it's not just him, even though he's the best example, is that if you live a pathological life, you pathologize your society and if enough people do that, then it's held really, really, and you can read the Gulag archipelago. If you have the fortitude to do that and you'll see exactly what hell is like and then you can decide if that's a place you'd like to visit or even more importantly, if it's a light. If it's a place you'd like to visit and take all your family and friends because that's what happened in the 20th century.

Speaker 12:         01:39:42       Okay, so now I'll read you the story of the Buddha, the father of Prince Gautama, the Buddha savior of the Orient, determined to protect his son from desperate knowledge and tragic awareness built for him and enclosed pavilion, a walled garden of earthly delights. Okay, so the story goes that an angel visited Buddhist father and said that he's going to have a son and the son is either going to become the greatest ruler that the world has ever seen or a spiritual leader and the father being a practical man thought where there's no bloody way. I want my son to be some like wandering spiritual leader. I want him to be the greatest king that the world has ever seen. Okay? And so the father decides, how am I going to get my son to be the greatest ruler the world has ever seen? I better get them to fall in love with the world because then he's not going to go traipsing after some sort of pathway.

Speaker 12:         01:40:32       Did spiritual knowledge. He's going to stick to practical tasks, right? That's something that a father should do to some degree is orient you in the world. Right? And maybe shouldn't subvert your spiritual development to any great degree, but there's a practical element to this and and so anyways, that's how it works. And so that's what happens. The father bill is this of perfection and he eliminates from it everything that's a reminder of the suffering that's associated with life. So the only thing that's allowed, the only creatures that are allowed to be in there, the only people that are allowed to be in there are healthy, young, and happy people. So the Buddha grows up surrounded by nothing but the positive elements of life. Well, you think, well, what does that mean? While it's akin to the paradise idea, obviously walled enclosure of paradise where there's no death, but there's more to it than that too.

Speaker 12:         01:41:23       It's also in some sense what a good father would do. What do you do with your young children? Well, you don't expose them to death and decay at every step of the way. Right? To you. You build a protected world for them like a wall enclosure, and you only keep what's healthy and life giving inside of it, and you don't expose them to things that they can't tolerate. You know, maybe you don't take a three year old to a funeral. Now maybe you do, but maybe you don't. There's things that you don't expect them to be able to cope with. You regulate what they're allowed to watch. You're not going to show them the tech Texas chainsaw massacre when they're four years old. Right, so so you're staving off knowledge of mortality and death, and so he's just being a good father in many ways here.

Speaker 12:         01:42:05       All signs of decay and degeneration where thus kept hidden from the prince, immersed in the immediate pleasures of the census in physical love and dance and music and beauty and pleasure. Gautama grew to maturity, protected absolutely from the limitations of mortal being. However, he grew curious, despite his father's most particular attention and will and resolve to leave his seductive prison. Well, it's that curiosity element. It's the same thing that lurks in the Adam and Eve story. It's like God tells Adam and Eve, see that tree over there. Don't be bothered with it. Well, you know what's going to happen with human beings, especially if there's a snake associated with it. They're going to be over there right away. Check in that place out, and that's exactly what happens with the Buddha. It's like he's raised to be healthy and what is. What's the consequence of that is that the fact that he's healthy makes them look for what's beyond the protected confines of the thing that made him healthy.

Speaker 12:         01:43:01       It's like what's like even in the Japan story, you know where Japan Paints on Pinocchio, his mouth, and he's ready to go. He puts them outside the next day and Pinocchio is ready to run away with all the kids. Right? So the consequence of raising a child in a healthy way is that the child is going to be curious enough to go out there and look for some trouble and we actually know that because there is followup studies of teenagers, you imagine that there's teenagers who never break any rules and then there's teenagers who break all the rules. Okay? These teenagers don't do very well. Introverted, depressed, anxious, depressed. Sorry, I said that twice. These ones are antisocial. The ones in the middle, that's what you want. You want your damn teenager to get out of the paradisical confines of your house and to go cause some trouble and to investigate.

Speaker 12:         01:43:46       Maybe you don't want to know about it anymore than you have to. You don't want them to be breaking rules all the time and you don't want them to be so timid into press that they can't make a move on their own and never make a mistake. So the paradoxical thing here, and it sort of echoed are, this is why I like these two stories back to back is like if you give people what they want, then the first thing they're going to do is try to get beyond it. And Dostoevsky says the same thing and notes from underground. He says, if you gave people everything they wanted, pure utopia. So he says, so that they're sitting in a pool of bliss with nothing but bubbles of happiness coming up from the surface and all they have to do is eat cake. And busy themselves with the continuation of the species.

Speaker 12:         01:44:27       Dusty said Dostoyevsky's observation is the first thing that people would do is find something to smash that with. Just so that something interesting and perverse could happen. It's like, well, yes, we're, we're creatures that are designed to encounter the unknown. We want to keep moving beyond what we have. Even if we have what we have is what we want. And maybe that's partly because we're oriented towards the future. We think, well this is great, but it's not good enough. It's great, but it's not good enough. There's always something more that drives us forward. While. So that's what happens with the Buddha. He gets curious. He sees the walls, he thinks there's walls, there's probably something outside of those walls. So then he goes to his father and he says, I'm, I want to go outside, what's outside? And his father says, no, you don't want to go outside.

Speaker 12:         01:45:16       And Buddha says, yeah, well I really do want to go outside. And his father knows that unless he lets him go outside, he's going to climb over the walls. And so the father decides he's gonna. Let them go inside, please go fix everything out there first. So he goes outside. It's like the Chinese preparing for the Olympics, you know when they sprayed the grass with with with green paint, got rid of all the homeless people is the same thing. So he goes outside the city and he tells everyone, all right, old people, sick people dying. People hit the road. We don't want to see it for awhile. Clean all this out. We want the attractive people around the sides of the roads like waving palm fronds and all of that and so when my son comes out, he's going to see nothing but what's good and so we get that all arranged it.

Speaker 12:         01:45:56       He lets his son go outside. Now his son goes outside in this little chariot thing and he has someone with him now, unbeknownst to his father, that person that's with them as an emissary of the gods. And so in a perverse way, he plays the same role as the serpent in the story of Adam and eve, and the gods have already arranged so that the father's a carer is going to be insufficient and it's the snake in the garden idea. It's like no matter how much care you take to make things perfect, some of the some of what what you're excluding is going to come back in. So anyways, Buddha goes outside and he's in his chariot and preparations were made to guild is chosen route to cover the adventurous path with flowers and to display for his admiration and preoccupation, the fairest women of the kingdom.

Speaker 12:         01:46:46       The print set out with full retinue in the shield and comfort of a chaperone chariot. And delighted in the Panorama previously prepared for him. The gods, however, decided to disrupt these most carefully laid plans and sent an aged man to hobble in full view alongside the road. The princess fascinated gaze fell upon the ancient interloper. Compelled by curiosity. He asked his attendant, what is that creature stumbling, shabby bent and broken beside my retinue and the attendant answered that is a man like other men who was born in infant became a child, a youth, a husband, a father, a father of fathers. He has become old subject to destruction of his beauty, his will, and the possibilities of life like other men, you say, hesitantly inquired the prints. That means this will happen to me, and the attendant answered inevitably with the passage of time. Well, that's the end of that party.

Speaker 12:         01:47:40       The world collapses in on Buddha and paying he hightails at home. Well, what does that mean? Well, that's what children do. Roughly speaking is there around their mother. There are. They've got security there. They go out into the unknown, they encounter something that's just a little bit too much for them. Bang, they come home, they get old, padded, back into shape and hugged, didn't taken care of. Hugging children and patting is actually analgesic. It actually reduces pate. Unsurprisingly, that's what you do with someone who's grieving, right? So you hug them because grief is paid so, so they, you know, you pat them and they get rid of their pain. They get rid of their anxiety, you calm them down and what happens? Well, the next day they want to go out again. Well, that's exactly what happens to the Buddha. So he's all shorted out by his encounter with death, which is very little different than what happens to Adam and eve runs back recoveries for six months.

Speaker 12:         01:48:29       He has posttraumatic stress disorder. He runs home and he recovers for six months, right in time. His anxiety lessened his curiosity, grinny. He ventured outside again. This time that God sent a sick man interview this creature, he asked his attendance, shaking and palsy, horribly afflicted, unbearable to behold, a source of pity and contempt. What is he? And the attendant answered that's a man like other men was born whole, but who became ill and sick, unable to cope, a burden to himself and others suffering and incurable like other men, you say, inquired the prince. This could happen to me and the attendant answers, no man is exempt from the ravages of disease. Once again, the world collapsed and Gautama returned to his home, but the delights of his previous life were ashes in his mouth and he ventured forth a third time, the gods in their mercy sent him a dead man in funeral procession. This creature, he asked his attendant laying so still appearing, so fearsome, surrounded by grief and by Soro last and for Lauren. What is he? And the attendant answered that is a man like other men, born of woman, beloved in hated. Who is once you. Who once was you, and now as the earth like other men you say acquired prince,

Speaker 11:         01:49:48       then this could happen to me. This is your and said the attendant and the end of all men. Well, that's the end of childhood, right? There's no going back after that. It's like Pinocchio goes back. There's no one home anymore. It's there's nothing that your father can do to protect you from knowledge of death. There is no returning to the childhood unconsciousness because you're. You now know, and there's no going backwards. Suicide. That's going backwards. That's how you replace your emergent self consciousness with the old blissful unconsciousness, and that's exactly what suicidal people wish that are going to destroy their painful selfconsciousness and make it all go away. The world collabs to final time and Gautama asked to be returned home, but the attendant had orders from the prince's father and took them instead to a festival of women. Oh, curing. Near occurring nearby in a grove in the woods. The prince was met by a beautiful assemblage who offered themselves freely to him without restraint in song, dance and play in the spirit of sensual love, but Gautama could think only of death and the inevitable decomposition of beauty and took no pleasure in the display.

Speaker 11:         01:51:00       Well, so you see the parallels between one story and the other. They're the same. They have the same underlying structure, initial paradise, partly childhood, partly unconsciousness. The emergence of knowledge of mortality into that and the demolition of the of the paradise. This is the same story that we've been talking about all along. Ordered state collapse into chaos. While the rest of the story is the return, like in the Bible, Bible is actually set up that way, it's collapse into history and then

Speaker 11:         01:51:32       a movement upward. The question is, what's the movement upward? That's the question here. When the collapse is caused by knowledge of mortality and self caught and the emergence of self consciousness and knowledge of death, is there any manner in which redemption can be attained or is that the final like, is that finally, is that. Does that finally demolished you? Well, that's the question and that's that's, that's it's the answer to that question that entire civilizations constantly pursue and the question is, well, what is the answer? And part of the answer is identification with this spirit that generates order out of chaos. Well, I'll tell you a couple of strange things that it thinks that I don't really understand. The first is when we've done the analysis of the effects of the future authoring program, it has had a different differential impact on men and it's had a particularly differential impact on what I would call it excluded men and so that would be non western ethic minority men or or what majority of men who aren't doing very well. So for example, at Mohawk College, the future authoring program had a particularly robust effect on Mohawk college who are men who

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       hadn't done very well in high school and who hadn't picked a major that had a destination, a career destination edits, and so you can imagine those people are. They have an ambiguous relationship with the idea of education and they're not oriented specifically towards a goal. They're not very motivated. Now why did it have a differential effect on men? That's a good question. Well, first of all, the women are doing better, so it might just be a matter of the fact that it does better for people who aren't doing as well and at the moment most of them are men. I don't believe. I think that might be part of it, but I don't believe that's all of it. I think that part of the reason that women are doing better is because they're agreeable and so if a system sets out a structure and says, here's a pathway to attainment, the women won't rebel against that.

Speaker 5:          01:53:35       They'll go along with it and that's working very well for them at the moment. The men, especially the men on the disagreeable end of the distribution and there's way more men on the district disagreeable end of the distribution. Then there are women, right? That's what you get from. If you look at overlapping normal distributions. So there's the male district, female distribution for agreeableness, mail distribution for agreeableness. Tremendous overlap. Okay. Women are higher. All the really agreeable people are women. All the really disagreeable people are meant and maybe the real differences occur at the extremes, right? So, so, and it's, it's a very interesting side effect of overlapping distributions so people can be mostly the same, but that can still produce radical differences. Disagreeable men won't do anything they don't want to do. They just say, up yours, I'll go home and play video games with you.

Speaker 5:          01:54:25       I'm not listening to your stupid classes and why should I work for you? I'll just go have fun. I'll do my own thing. I don't think they're motivated. And so then if you take the men who are like that and you say, okay, what do you want? You can have what you want, but you have figured out what it is. So then they write down what they want and they think, oh hey, well that might be worth having. So maybe I'll put some effort into it. That's what it looks like to me. Now, you know, that's weak evidence and this is a weak argument, but I'm trying to stretch out my understanding to account for this, but I'll tell you something else that's really weird. I don't understand this either. So more than 90 percent of the people who watch my videos on youtube are men.

Speaker 5:          01:55:04       Now that's weird because now about 80 percent of psychology students are women, so that is not what you would expect, right? You would expect that the majority of them would be women and you might say, well, it's because of the political stance I've taken and I thought, well that's possible. So I went and looked at the demographic data because I have that. Well before I did any of the political videos, 85 percent of my viewers were men, so it's actually increased a bit. It's increased by six percent and that's not trivial, but it was still overwhelmingly men. So that was interesting. I thought, what the hell, why is that? Exactly. And then now I've been watching crowds when I've been talking to them and the crowds that have come to see me in person. This happened at the University of Toronto Free Speech Debate and I actually noticed it and commented on it before the debate took place because I was talking about intrinsic differences between men and women and I looked around the room and I thought, hey, 80 percent of the people in this room are men.

Speaker 5:          01:55:58       So I had all the men, women and women stand up and then all the men stand up. I said, look like here's a natural experiment. For some reason, 80 percent of the people who showed up to this are men now. Everybody thought I was kinda cracked to to do that and it was a risk, but I thought, no, there's something going on here. And then what's interesting now is that every public appearance that I've made that's related to the sort of topics that we're discussing is overwhelmingly men. It's like it's like 85 to 90 percent. And so I thought, wow, that's weird. Like what the Hell's going on here? Exactly. And then the other thing I've noticed is that I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I've been talking to, not about rights but about responsibility, right? Because you can't have the bloody converse.

Speaker 5:          01:56:40       What are you doing? You can't have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility because your rights are my responsibility. That's what they are technically. So you just can't have only half of that discussion and we're only having half that discussion. The question is, well, what the hell are you leaving out? If you only have that half of the discussion and the answer is, well, you're leaving out responsibility and then the question is, well, what are you leaving out? If you're leaving out responsibility and that answer might be, well, maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life. That's what it looks like to me. It's like, here you are suffering away. What makes it worthwhile? Rights. You know you're completely, oh, you're completely. You have no idea what you're you. It's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is. Responsibility. That's what gives life meaning.

Speaker 5:          01:57:36       It's like lift a load. Then you can tolerate yourself, right? Because look at your useless, easily hurt, easily killed. Why should you have any self respect? That's the story of the fall. Pick something up and carry it. Pick. Make it heavy enough so that you can think, yeah, well useless as I am. At least I could move that from there to there. Well, what's really cool about that is that when I talk to these crowds about this, the man's eyes light up and that's very like I've seen that phenomena because I've been talking about this mythological material for a long time and I can see what I'm watching. Crowds people you know, their eyebrows lift, their eyes light up because I put something together for them, not what mythological stories do, so I'm not taking responsibility for that. That's what the stories do. So I say this story to people, go click, click, click.

Speaker 5:          01:58:22       You know when their eyes light up, but this responsibility thing that's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that. It is unbelievable. And one of the things I've been talking to some of the people who've been running for the conservative leadership in Canada and I've been talking to them about, well, if the difficulties they have communicating with young people because conservatives, what the hell are they going to sell to young people, right? Because being conservative is something that happens when you're older. They can sell responsibility. No one's selling it. And the thing is, for men, there's nothing but responsibility. You know, I was watching the simpsons the other day. I watched the simpsons episode and I deconstructed it, and so it's really interesting. So what happens in the first Simpson episode is that it's Christmas and homer and marge are going to buy some Christmas presents, but homer doesn't get his Christmas bonus.

Speaker 5:          01:59:11       And so it was absolutely crushed by that. And that actually is a recurring theme in the simpsons where homer loses his job or something like that or can't make enough money. He's completely crushed even though he's kind of useless, bumbling, laughing, full of a guy, you know? The thing that gives that show its soul is that he still oriented towards his family. That's what makes them honorable, is that foolish as he is. He's decided to adopt responsibility for his family and to try to bear that. And so he's not. He's a holy fool. He's not a complete fool. And so interesting watching the story because he suffers dreadfully as a consequence of not being able to fulfill this responsibility. Well, that's for men. Women have their sets of responsibilities. They're not the same, right, because they're complicated because women of course have to take primary responsibility for, for having infants at least, but then also for caring for them, they're.

Speaker 5:          02:00:03       They're structured differently than men for biological necessity, even if it's not a psychological issue and it's also partly a psychological issue. Women know what they have to do. Men have to figure out what they have to do and if they have nothing worth living for them, they stay Peter Pan and why the hell not because the alternative to valued responsibility is impulsive, low class pleasure, and you saw that in the Pinocchio Story, right? That's pleasure island. It's like, well, why lift the load if there's nothing in it for you? That's another thing that we're doing to men. That's a very bad idea and two boys, so like your pathological and oppressive. It's like, fine. Then why the hell am I going to play if that's the. If that's the situation. If I get no credit for bearing responsibility, you can bloody well be sure I'm not going to bear it, but then you know your life is useless and meaningless and you have your full of self contempt, denialism and, and that's not good.

Speaker 5:          02:01:04       And so that's why I think that's what I think is going on at a deeper level with regards to men needing this direction. A man has to decide that he's going to do something. He has to decide that, yeah, well, you know partly what you're trying to do in the future authoring process to say, okay, well what's your highest value? Right? It's the star. It's like, okay, what are you aiming for? You can decide man, but you know there is some criteria. It should be good for you. It should be good for you in a way that facilitates your moving forward. Maybe it should be good for you in a way that's also good for the family and the community. It should cover the, the domain of life mean there's constraints on what you should regard as a value, but you. But within those constraints, you have the choice.

Speaker 5:          02:01:49       You have choice. Well, the thing is is that people will carry a heavy load if they get to pick the god damn load so and they think, well, I won't carry any load. It's like, okay, fine, but then you're like the sled dog that doesn't have a sled. Depaul, you're just gonna. You're in a terror pieces out of your own legs because you're bored, you know you need. People are pack animals. They need, they need to pull against a weight and that's not true for everyone. It's not true. Particularly say for low conscientious people. I mean maybe they're open and creative are extroverted and some other things, but for the, for the typical person, they, they, they'll eat themselves, they'll eat themselves up unless they have a load. This is why there's such an opiod epidemic among a dispossessed white, middle aged guys who are unemployed in the US.

Speaker 5:          02:02:35       So like they lose their job, they're done right? They despise themselves, they develop chronic pain syndromes and depression and the chronic pain is treated with opiates. That's what we're doing. So yeah, that's what it looks like to me is you have to. And it's so interesting to watch the young men when you talk to them about responsibility. There is a God damn thrilled about it. It just blows me away. It's like, really? That's what's. That's the counterculture. Grow the hell up and do something useful. Really. I could do that. Oh, I'm so excited by that idea. No one ever mentioned that before. It's like rights, rights, rights, rights, Jesus. It's, it's, it's appalling. It's an end. And I feel that that's deeply felt by the people who are, who are coming out to to listen to these sorts of things, to there. They've had enough of that so. And they better have because it's a non productive motive being responsibility, man. That's where the meaning in life is. So

Speaker 7:          02:03:43       the most fundamental element, creativity is actually conceptualized as a biological trait. Different personalities. We all know our terminology for describing those personalities is broad and somewhat difficult to categorize, but psychologists progress in the last 40 years pretty from the strictest scientific perspective. And they know that people differ in extroversion, extroverted, gregarious, and enthusiastic and assert. And so they seem to wind their way through the world by utilizing social capital and social networks. Extroverts don't necessarily like you and creative people.

Speaker 5:          02:04:26       Extroverts, well create creative people is slightly tilted towards extroversion, but that's not the fundamental dimension of introverted. People like to spend time alone and there's plenty creative introverted

Speaker 14:         02:04:37       people, um, that another personality dimension is known as neuroticism, somewhat unflatteringly, and it's, it's an index of sensitivity to negative emotion so that if people, if you know people who are volatile, you know they're touchy and they tend to fly off the handle, or they're a or they're sad or morose or anxious, or tend to avoid stressful situations, then they tend to be higher in trait neuroticism. And that's specifically a negative emotion dimension. Extroversion is an index of positive emotion. And so people, they're separate biological systems, positive and negative from them trying to get back to creativity or the third. The third category is agreeableness. Agreeable people are compassionate and they basically live for, for close, intimate, personal relationships. There's conscientious people who are due to full. And then there are open people and the open people, it's the dimension is called openness to experience. There are people who are fundamentally interested in ideas, so if you're talking to an open person, they will immediately move the conversation to to the discussion of ideas.

Speaker 14:         02:05:41       So most of the people in the audience tonight, for those who aren't here for political curiosity are here because they're open people, they want to, they want to hear an intellectual discussion and and so open people are interested in ideas. That's the intellect component of openness and then they're also interested in aesthetics and that would be where the artists really intellect and aesthetics is where the artists come out and that was the thing that's important to know about that and it's why I went through all five traits. These are fundamentally, these are attributes and ways of looking at the world, ways of behaving that are fundamentally rooted in biology. They're very, very deep. It's not a surface trait by any stretch of the imagination and creative people also tend to be a higher in, in, in trade intelligence, technically speaking, and that's the ability to manipulate abstractions rapidly.

Speaker 14:         02:06:28       So is creativity is sort of second level. Then comes the, the, the, uh, the traits that you've just described, don't include them. Where are they in that group? While creativity, creativity loads very highly with openness. It, it's getting idiot create creativity and openness are probably synonymous more or less, although it isn't obvious that interest in ideas per se is the same as creativity, but there's very few people who are artistic who aren't very interested in ideas. So they, they move along the same path very tightly. So let's unpack this notion because you know, it's axiomatic that creativity and art are a indistinguishable. Is that true from the point of view of a psychologist? I would say it's, it's, it's, it's a pretty decent, it's a pretty decent truth. It's open. People are the ones that are interested in aesthetics. So you know, there are lots of people who are in some sense blind too, but it's actually one of the things that distinguishes, strangely enough, it distinguishes conservatives and liberals roughly speaking because liberal liberal people tend to be high in openness.

Speaker 14:         02:07:30       They tend to be creative, but they're low in trait conscientiousness. So they're not very beautiful. They're not orderly, they're not particularly industrious, not, not compared to conservatives, liberals, yes and well, it's partly because you see this is one of the paradoxes. Conservatives are high in conscientiousness, especially orderliness and they're low in openness. And I think the reason for that in part is that it's not that easy to be creative if you're too industrious or orderly. Because imagine, imagine you want to be a musician and you're 18, 19 years old or worse, 25 years old, you know? Well, the thing is is that it's an insane thing to do if you, if you're someone who's dutiful and career oriented and practical because the probability that you're going to monetize your creativity is so low that it's futile to even attempt it in many situations. And so if you're too concerned with convention and, and productivity, then that's going to undercut your ability to, to, to manifest adherence to your creative vision, which also takes you and all sorts of directions, none of which are necessarily practical.

Speaker 14:         02:08:34       So one of the ways of thinking about creativity is that it's, it's a gambling strategy and, and conservatives make low risk, low return, but certain bets really. And whereas the more liberal types and the more creative types, they make high risk, high return bits. And so almost all of them fail, but those who succeed succeed dramatically. And they also changed the world. And so although it's very foolish to be creative, it's creative people who, who lead the vanguard for forward into the unknown and transform the world. So foolish as it is, it's absolutely necessary. Foolish because risky. Yes, because risky. Yes, I mean it's risk. It's foolish in the same way that a high risk, high return bet is foolish. There's a high probability that you'll lose. And so if you're a conservative person, you're very concerned about hedging your bets. You don't want to lose being creative as a very bad game to play, but you won't play it anyways because you're conservative so it isn't going to matter.

Speaker 14:         02:09:29       So you are a, an open, a late teen and you have conservative parents and you say, mom, Dad, I'm, I think I've decided that I'm going to be an artist and they think what's wrong with that kid that the death. A complicated conversation, isn't it? Yes, yes, it's, it's, it's, it's like discussing color with someone who's colorblind and, and I mean that like it's actually a perverse things about perverse thing about conservatives in some sense because the data on the economic utility of artists is really, really strong. I mean artists, artists and entrepreneurs are the same people and of course entrepreneurs are the people who provide all of the vision for the entire capitalist system. They're absolutely necessary, but conservatives tend to be so blind to art that they can't even see that the artists are the people who drive the who drive the economy forward.

Speaker 14:         02:10:16       But you make them sound so bad. No, there you lord. So here's, here's another way of thinking about it as we're talking about political, conservative political liberals, yes, they're also talking about trait, like personality traits, determined voting patterns to a great degree. So people vote their temperaments and this is something that's useful to understand when you're engaged in a political discussion is that the person across the table from you who holds viewpoints other than yours is not doing it because they're stupid or ill informed. They're doing it because they are not the same sort of person you are. And the the funny thing about about creative people versus conservative people say are liberal people versus conservative people is that liberal start companies and conservatives run them. So and I'm really glad to know you need to conserve their managers like conscientious people make good managers and good administrators.

Speaker 14:         02:11:06       It's and they tend to do better in school too because diligence and due to fullness is an excellent predictor of academic performance. So if you want something, if you want something that's already been invented, implemented, and then turned into a machine, you don't get someone creative to do that. They're off to do the next thing. They're not even interested in that you'll bore them to death. So, uh, so let's say you're an employer and you need some creative people. They're a psychometric test to find out if someone's actually creative and they're going to be useful. Well, Iq tests work. I mean, not, not everyone with a high Iq is creative. Lots of lawyers have high Iq and they tend not to be creative at all. Well, you think to think about why that is a. because lawyers are bound by precedent and, and rules and so that isn't the same as being creative.

Speaker 14:         02:11:53       And you don't, you want a creative accountant? No, not really. Not, not unless you're looking for a jail sentence. So they don't like that word at all. No, no. Absolutely. Yeah, that's right. My creative accountant wake. Wake right. It's so, so, so. I mean, I tested, I tested psychometrically tested 100 most creative lawyers in Canada as, as a project about 15 years ago with a magazine called expert, which was a high prestige magazine among lawyers. We had lawyers from across the country be nominated for their by their firms, for creativity and and so we got some really like these were outstanding lawyers, so and we tested them psychometrically very, very high and intelligence, but I'm not creative at all. The first, the first trait was conscientious due to full, hardworking, diligent, industrious, orderly, because you know, you're working 70 hours a week and you better bloody well work if you're in a position like that too.

Speaker 14:         02:12:48       So it's nose to the grindstone stuff very low in neuroticism because it's very stressful. So they didn't experience a bunch of negative emotion, very disagreeable people while their letter get litigated. And so they would, they want to win. They're not compassionate and they're not polite and only after that where they opened. So they weren't creative at all, but they were extraordinarily intelligent. So do employers look for creative people? No. No, not generally. Well, it's a real. It's a real conundrum. So one of the things that's happening right now is that in most businesses, the noncreative people are increasingly being replaced by machines, right? Because anything that's creative can really be turned into an algorithm and that you can run as a machine, but anything that isn't creative can be and so there's increasing demand incorporations for creative people, but the problem with being creative is that you're useless at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy because at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy, so a power hierarchy, you should do what you're told to do.

Speaker 14:         02:13:48       You're not there to think outside the box. You're there to learn what you're supposed to do and implement it and creative people are like, that's. That is what they do. Now what happens though to companies is that because they filter all the creative people out at the bottom and then people start to rise up to the top. You really need creative people at the top because they are the entrepreneurial types and they're the ones. For example, in law firms, even though lawyers aren't very creative, the more entrepreneurial ones are the ones that bring in all the business. There's like great lawyers who can, who can implement, who can, who can, who can write well and communicate well. Are there not a diamond dozen, but they're relatively common, but the ones who are entrepreneurial who can go out there and drum up new business? Man, those people are super hyper valuable and they're very rare, but they are, but it's also very difficult to nurse them within any system because systems do not nurture creativity. There are the antithesis of creativity because the artist is always the person who stands outside the structure and so or maybe builds his or her own structure, which is also why it's hard to evaluate creative people. You can't really because if they're operating within the confines of a system that has an evaluative structure, they're not creative.

Speaker 12:         02:15:01       We're having a conversation. I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you. Right? That's different than how people generally communicate because usually when they communicate, they're doing something like, okay, we're going to have a conversation and I'm going to tell you why I'm right and all win. If you agree or maybe you're having a conversation where I don't know what you're trying to do, maybe you're trying to impress the person you're talking to so you're not listening to them at all. You're just thinking about what you're gonna. Say Next. Okay, so that's not this. This is. You might have something to tell me and so I'm going to listen on the off chance that you'll tell me something that would really be useful for me to know and so you can take about it as an, as an extension of the Piagetian. Piaget talked about the fundamental, the fundamentally important element of knowledge being to describe how knowledge is sought, the process by which knowledge is generated.

Speaker 12:         02:15:57       Well, if you agree with me and I find that out, I know nothing more than I knew before. I just know what I knew before and maybe unhappy about that because it didn't get challenged, but I'm no smarter than I was before, but maybe you're different than me and so while I'm listening to you'll tell me something I wouldn't. I don't like. Maybe it's something I find contemptible or difficult, whatever. Maybe you'll find you'll tell me something I don't know and then I won't be quite as stupid and then maybe I won't run painfully into quite as many things and that's a really useful thing. Know, especially if you live with someone and you're trying to make longterm piece with them as they are not the same as you and they're away. They look at the world and the facts that they pull out of the world aren't the same as your facts and even though you're going to be overwhelmed with the proclivity to demonstrate that you're right, it is the case that two brains are better than one and so maybe nine of the 10 things they tell you are dispensable or maybe even 49 out of 50, but one thing all you need to get out of the damn conversation is one thing you don't know.

Speaker 12:         02:17:02       And one of the things that's very cool about a good psychotherapeutic session is that the whole conversation is like that. All you're doing is trying to express the truth of the situation as clearly as possible. That's it. And so now rogers' proposition, and I'll tell you why he derived it, was that if you have a conversation like that with someone, it will make both of you better. It will make both of you psychologically healthier. So there's an implicit presupposition that the exchange of truth is curative. Well, that's a very cool idea. I mean, it's a very deep idea. Uh, I think it's the most profound idea. It's the, it's the idea upon western civil upon which Western civilization, although not only Western civilization, is actually predicated the idea that truth produces health. But for Rogers, that was the entire purpose of the psycho therapeutic alliance.

Speaker 12:         02:18:03       You come to see me because you want to be better. You don't even know what that means necessarily. Neither do I. we're going to figure that out together. But you come and you say, look, things are not acceptable to me and maybe there's something I could do about that. So that's the minimal precondition to engage in therapy. Something's wrong. You're willing to talk about it truthfully, and you want it to be better. Without that, the therapeutic relationship does not get off the ground. And so then you might ask, well, what relationships are therapeutic? And the answer that would be if you have a real relationship, it's therapeutic. If it isn't, what you have is not a relationship. God only knows what you have. You're a slave, they're a tyrant, you know, you're both butting heads with one another. It's a primate dominance hierarchy dispute. Oh, I don't know.

Speaker 12:         02:18:50       You're like two cats in a barrel or two people with their hands around each other's throats. But what you have is not a relationship. So alright, we may say that the greater the communicated congruence of experience, awareness and behavior on the part of one individual, that's, that's a reference to the same idea that I was describing with regards to yoke. So let's say you come and talk to me and you want things to go, well, well I'm going to have to more or less be one thing. Because if I'm all over the place, you can't trust any continuity in what I say. There's no. And there's no reason for you to believe that I'm capable of actually telling you I'm capable of expressing anything that's true. So the truth is something that emerges as a consequences of getting yourself lined up and beating all the, what would you call all the impurities out of your, out of your, out of your soul for black of a better word.

Speaker 12:         02:19:48       You have to be integrated for that to happen and you do that at least in part by wanting to tell the truth. The more the ensuing relationship will involve a tendency towards reciprocal communication with the same qualities. So one of the things that I've been quite influenced by Rogers, one of the things I tried to do in my therapeutic sessions is first of all to listen to really listen and then, well, well I listen, I watch and while I'm listening things will happen in my head, you know, maybe I'll get a little image of something or I'll get a thought or a question will emerge and then I'll just tell the person what that is. But it's sort of directionless, you know? It's not like I have a goal except that we're trying to make things better. I'm on the side of the person. I'm on the side of the part of the person that wants things to be better, not worse, and so then those parts of us have a dialogue and the consequences of that dialogue is that certain things take place and then I'll just tell the person what happened and it isn't that I'm right.

Speaker 12:         02:20:44       That's not the point. The point is, is that they get to have an hour where someone actually tells them what they think. Here's the impact you're having on me. You know, this is making me angry. This is making me happy. This is really interesting. This reminds me of something that you said an hour ago that I don't quite understand, and the whole, the whole point is not for either person to make the proposition or convince the other that their position is correct, but merely to have an exchange of experience about how things are set up and it's extraordinarily useful for people because it's often difficult for anyone to find anyone to talk to that will actually listen. And so another thing that's really strange about this listening is that if you listen to people, they will tell you the weirdest bloody things so fast, you just cannot believe it.

Speaker 12:         02:21:33       So if you're having a conversation with someone and it's dull, it's because you're stupid. That's why you're not listening to them properly because they're weird. They're like wombats or albatrosses or rhinoceroses or something like they're strange creatures. And so if you were actually communicating with them and they were telling you how weird they really are, it would be. It would be anything but boring. So. And you can ask questions. That's a really good way of listening. But you know one of Roger's points as well. You have to be oriented properly in order to listen. And the orientation has to be. Look what I want out of this conversation is that the place we both end up is better than the place we left. That's it. That's what I'm after. And if you're not after that, you've got to think, why the hell wouldn't you be after that?

Speaker 12:         02:22:18       What could you possibly be after that would be better than that? You walk away smarter and more well equipped for the world than you were before you had the conversation, and so does the other person. Well, maybe if you're bitter and resentful and angry and anxious and you know, generally annoyed at the world, then that isn't what you want. You want the other person to walk away worse than Youtube because you're full of revenge, but you know you'll get what you want if you do that, so we know from our research that such empathic understanding, so already defined that I want to hear you. I want to hear what you have to say so we can clarify it and move forward. I want to have your best interests in mind and mine as well, but you know both at the same time and your families too.

Speaker 12:         02:23:03       If we could manage that, we're after making things better. We know from our research that such empathic understanding, understanding with a person, not about him. It's such an effective approach that it can bring about major changes in personality. Some of you may be feeling that you listen well to people and that you have never seen such results. The chances are very great that you have not been listening in the manner that I've described. Fortunately, I can suggest a little experiment that you can do to test the quality of your understanding. The next time you get into an argument with your wife or your friend or a small group of friends, stop the discussion for a moment and for an experiment institute this rule. Each person can speak up for himself only after he has first restated the ideas and feelings of the previous speaker accurately.

Speaker 12:         02:23:49       What accurately means is they have to agree with your restatement. Now, that's an annoying thing to do because if someone is talking to you and you disagree with them, the first thing you want to do is take their argument, make the stupidest possible thing out of it that you can. That's the straw man, and then demolish it. It's like so then you can walk away feeling good about it, and primate diamonds dominated them really nicely. So, but that isn't what you do. You say, okay, well I'm going to take what you told me and maybe I'm even going to make your argument stronger than the one you made. That's useful if you're dealing with someone that you have to live with because maybe they can't bloody well express themselves very well, but they have something to say so you make their argument strong. Alright, then you see what this would mean. It would mean that before presenting your own point of view, it'd be necessary for you to really achieve the other speakers frame of reference to understand his thoughts and feelings so well that you could summarize them for him. Sounds simple, doesn't it? But if you'll try it, you'll find that it's the most difficult thing that you've ever done. Okay, good. We'll leave it at that and then we'll see you on Tuesday.

Speaker 15:         02:24:58       What's my advice to young men seeking a woman for marriage and family? Yeah. Well, okay, fine. That's the same quest. Second question. That's, that's pretty straightforward man. I mean, you can't eliminate the necessity of being attracted to one another. That's important. And that's mysterious, you know? Um, so for example, here's a funny thing, if you, one of the things know that attracts people to one another is bilateral symmetry. And so if you take men and you ranked them by the cemetery of their faces and then you give the asymmetrical men tee shirts to wear clean t shirts for a day and the symmetrical men clean t shirts to wear for a day and then you give the t shirts to women and you have them rate the, the older, the women rate the odor of the symmetrical men as more attractive than the odor of the asymmetrical man.

Speaker 15:         02:25:53       And then, and there were other, uh, factors that determine sexual attractiveness that are based on biological factors that are so deeply embedded in terms of smell, for example. So a women also tend to not be sexually attracted to the, to the scent of men whose, who have, if I remember correctly, it's rh factors that would make for potential trouble in childbirth. And the often, the reason that the women give for not preferring the scent of those men is that they smell too much like their brother. Something like that. So there was weird, mysterious things that determine whether or not people are sexually and physically attracted to each other. And I think it's very important that that's part of a marital relationship. The next most important thing is trust. Man. It's like there's no marriage that's successful without trust you guys. You got to tell each other the truth.

Speaker 15:         02:26:49       And one of the reasons that you'll believe that marriage as a, an oath and Carl young as a bond was necessary. It's really wise. It's like, you know, telling the truth to someone is no simple thing because there's a bunch of things about all of us that are terrible and weak and reprehensible and shameful and all of those things. And they kind of have to be brought out into the open and dealt with. And you're not going to tell the truth about yourself to someone who can run away screaming when you reveal who you are. And so the marriage bond is something like, okay, here's the deal. I'm going to handcuff myself to you and you're going to handcuff yourself to me and then we're going to tell each other the truth. And neither of us are going to get to run away, and so our, once we know the truth, then we're either going to live together in mutual torment or we're going to try to deal with that truth and straighten ourselves out and straighten ourselves out jointly.

Speaker 15:         02:27:42       And that's going to make us more powerful and more resilient and more and deeper and wiser as we progress together through life. And, and I think that's absolutely brilliant because if you leave a backdoor open man, you're going to use it, that's for sure. And the oath is there. And this was [inaudible] commentary on the spiritualization of, of the human parable. And by Christian marriage, for example, which emphasized, uh, the, the, what would you call it, the subordination of both members of the marital union to a higher order, a personality that was embodied in the figure, the logos. So the idea is that in, in, in, in, in the Christian marriage, for example, the man isn't the boss and the woman isn't the boss, the boss is the mutual personality composed by the seeking of truth in both of them. And that's conceptualized as their, their joint subjugation to the logos and that is absolutely dead on, man.

Speaker 15:         02:28:42       It's like the ruler of your marital life should be your vowed to tell each other the truth because like in hard times during your life, when you've done something stupid and idiotic, that might take you down and you don't have anybody that you can turn to, you know, if you have a partner that you can trust, you can go say, hey, you know, I made a big financial mistake man and it's really torturing me and I feel like a complete idiot and it's really dangerous. And the person there, it's going to help you figure out what to do about it. And they're going to know that when they make a stupid mistake and they're bloody well going to, that they can come and talk to you and that you guys are going to work your way through it. And that's a big deal. And there's a couple of things our culture gets really wrong.

Speaker 15:         02:29:22       And one is it devalues marriage. That's really a very bad idea because marriages, marriages like a third of your life. And maybe more and kids are a third of your life and your, your, your life outside of marriage and kids is a third of your life, you know, approximately speaking and to miss any of that is a massive, massive mistake. Now, having said that, I will also say that for some people missing one or more of those is necessary because they have a reason. You know, maybe they're brilliantly creative artists and they need to devote themselves entirely to their career or they're outstanding in some way and so they need, they can justify the sacrifice of one part of that triad, of being to another part, but for. But generally speaking, it's a very dangerous thing and, and it, it, it shouldn't be done. And also kids get an absolutely terrible rap, you know, because kids are delightful if they're well behaved.

Speaker 15:         02:30:19       One of the chapters in my new book is called don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them. And you can do that, especially if you discuss it thoroughly with your spouse. You're the person that's helping you discipline the kids and children are the best company because they're really enthusiastic about everything they love doing new things. They really love you, so they're happy that you're around. All you have to do is make sure they're not too hot and they're not too cold and they've had something to eat and they're not too tired and you don't expect them to stay engaged in something for longer than they can manage because we used to take our kids when they were little out to restaurants for example. And they could sit there no problem and behave really nicely when they were two and three, but they couldn't do it for more than about 45 minutes.

Speaker 15:         02:31:02       He can't push your luck. But I also noticed with little kids is that they got antsy and unreasonable about five to 10 minutes before the adults did too. It's just the adults were too stupid to notice. The kids would notice right away. So, um, so back to marriage, while you look for someone you're attracted to, that you love, and then you look for someone that you can bloody well trust. And then you tell them the truth and that way maybe you can get through life and you can have someone to weave the rope of your being with and together to make to make your joint ropes stronger and you can have some continuity in your narrative and you can have children and then you can have grandchildren and like you can have a life man and there is nothing. You are so fortunate if you can manage that.

Speaker 15:         02:31:46       And so. Okay, so there's that one. So what's my advice to young men seeking a woman for marriage and family? Yeah. Well, and also, you know, marry someone you think would be a good mother and that has enough sense generally speaking, to know that she wants children. Now some women don't want children and fair enough and some women perhaps shouldn't have children. That's also possible. But the general rule of thumb is, especially once a woman's, you know, in her mid twenties, if she doesn't know that she wants children or wounded, met it, unless she has a viciously important reason, then she's not oriented properly. Psychologically she, she, she isn't. She doesn't know what's important in life. Now, that might also be the case with you and it probably is, but as a rule of thumb, that's a really good one.

Speaker 3:          02:32:37       How do men and women differ in the way they evaluate mates?

Speaker 3:          02:32:42       Well, here's the study. More than a thousand respondents, primarily female. What they looked at was how much each person, how much prestige each person had in their occupation, so kind of where they were situated in the dominance hierarchy, what their income was under education, so there are all markers. They're all pretty decent markers of socio economic status or they're pretty decent markers of status, so and then they looked at how many partners each person had number of lifetime partners and number of preceding year sexual partners, lifetime occurrence of simultaneous partner. So that was someone who was in a relationship, a sexual relationship with more than one person at the same time and lifetime frequency of simultaneous partners from one very seldom or never to five. Very often, here's their assumption, the number of partners, a member of sex. A acquires is an index of how often this individual is chosen. By the other sex, it's just a definition, it's an indication of reproductive fitness as judged by members of the opposite sex results, male criteria for women, the correlation between their fertility rates and the number of partners in the previous year was point nine four,

Speaker 3:          02:34:04       so that's basically markers of biological youth and also markers of biological health like symmetry or waist to hip ratio, which actually tends to be correlated with reproductive fitness because women with lower waist to hip ratios are generally healthier because especially in youth, the acquisition of abdominal fat is often an indicator of subpar physical health. The correlation between the fertility rate and the number of partners in the previous year is point nine Ford. That's all of it, right? You never see a correlation to point nine for anywhere ever. Males choose fertility indicators, beauty waist to hip ratio, youthful appearance, neotenous facial features, and monotonous means like a infant. So one of the. One of the markers of feminine beauty is a face that has small childlike features,

Speaker 3:          02:35:08       female criteria all respondents. The correlation between socioeconomic status and frequency of simultaneous partners. For men it's point five, so the higher the status of the man man, the more likely yes simultaneous sexual partners, so it means he's going out with someone sexually at the same time. For men, it's point four, nine. For Women it's zero age 30 and over correlation between socioeconomic status and frequency of simultaneous partners. For men it's point eight. For Women it's zero age 30 to 39. The correlation between socioeconomic status for women and frequency of simultaneous partners. For men point nine two. That's a very small end though. For Women, it's point one, one female criteria. For men, it might reflect a tendency on the part of females to choose high status partners during their own reproductive years. This might account, especially for this strong relationship founded men between the age of 30 and 39 women who typically prefer men three to eight years older than they are, would then be in their mid to late twenties, a time when accountability and that sensitivity to male resources is at its peak

Speaker 3:          02:36:23       supporting evidence. I don't believe that, by the way, I don't think that women pick man for the socioeconomic status. I think that women pick men for the ability to climb the status hierarchy because we forced women in an experiment that we never published to choose between those two things. Wealth versus ability. The women overwhelmingly chose ability. They just use wealth as a marker of ability. Yep. It was an honors thesis and often honors thesis, even if they're publishable, drift into the thing all do next month and then they stay there forever. So because it's a heart, it's actually quite hard to turn an honors thesis into a publishable paper and if there isn't some single person driving that forward, it's it's not going to happen. So that that was the only reason. Okay, so trevor's parental investment model contends that women are more likely than men to seek a mate who possesses nonphysical characteristics that maximize the survival or reproductive prospects of their Osprey, and we're examining in a Meta analysis of meat selection research as predicted, women accorded more weight than men to socioeconomic status of ambitiousness character and intelligence and the larger differences. Largest Jeff gender differences were observed for cues to resource acquistion, acquisition status and ambitiousness. I'll also as predicted, gender preferences were not found in preferences for characteristics unrelated to progeny survival, like sense of humor in general, personality

Speaker 3:          02:37:53       were valid, comparisons could be made. The findings were generally invariant across generations, cultures and research paradigms. I'll go to this next one. Yeah. Okay, so here's some correlations. One of them is between how much money you make and your personality, so the correlation between neuroticism and how much money you get paid as negative point three. The higher you are in neuroticism, the less you make, less you get paid. Why? Why do you think that is? Well, because you're not confident in your own abilities. You have low self esteem, and if you're not confident in your own abilities and you're anxious about your performance, the probability that you're going to feel confident and calm about negotiating for more money or even asking for a raise is quite low.

Speaker 3:          02:38:49       Extraversion and money made virtually no correlation. Openness, no correlation. Agreeableness negative point two. For now, you might not think that those correlations are very large, but if the correlation between neuroticism and money made is negative. Point three, if you translate that into an effect size, because this is called the binomial effect size distribution, just the effect of neuroticism will ensure that 65 percent of men make more money than average on 35 percent of women make more money than average. Just the effect of neuroticism and if you add neuroticism and agreeableness together, I have to do the math because I have to square. I take the square root, two point five,

Speaker 6:          02:39:31       point five,

Speaker 3:          02:39:37       I can't do that in front of a class. Unfortunately it's going to push it up to about 70 slash 30 or higher than that. There's a little bit of a negative correlation between conscious conscientiousness and money made ascendancy. How well you progress up the rates? Yes. I don't know because I didn't look. I didn't look in detail into the models they use, so I was just going to stick to the zero order correlations, so ascendancy negative point one for neuroticism. Negative point one, four, four.

Speaker 3:          02:40:19       Agreeableness. The effects are larger if you total them. Let's see. Here's a good one. This is something to think about. Job Satisfaction. The correlation with neuroticism is negative point four, two, that's a big one. One of the things that's very interesting about eroticism is it's also a very good predictor of marital satisfaction and it's interesting in that light to note that 70 percent of divorces are initiated by women. Now, one reason for that is that men are impossible get along with and the other possibility is that women are too sensitive to that and there's no way of sorting that out, but it's nonetheless interesting to note that that's still where the gender difference lies. Neuroticism, correlation with job satisfaction, negative point for two, correlation with life satisfaction, negative point for two, correlation with career satisfaction, negative point four, one, so one of the things you want to remember is that almost all the measures that purport to measure something like wellbeing or happiness or satisfaction are so contaminated with neuroticism, that it's not even clear that they're measuring something different. You see agreeableness. The correlation with career satisfaction is negative point two, if you get men to rate their performance and you get their bosses to rate their performance, men rate their performance pretty much the same as the boss is rate their performance or maybe they rate them a little bit more, but if women raped their own performance, they rate their own performance as worse than their bosses rating of their performance consistently, and the predictor of that seems to be negative emotionality.

Speaker 3:          02:42:08       Now you might wonder if negative emotionality is something that's associated with lower levels of life satisfaction across a broad variety of measures. What possible use could it be, but then you have to wonder, well, exactly how is the physical environment different for women and for men and one clearer fact is that at an individual level, at least in relationship to dominance battles with men, women are at a disadvantage not least because of their size.

Speaker 11:         02:42:47       Here's another, here's another something worth considering. I don't know how important it is, but it might be really important. It depends on how important this is. Something that Carl Young said, so it depends on how important. Youngest now, Freud established the field of psychoanalysis and with an investigation I would say rigorous investigation into the contents, the unconscious, a modern psychologists and psychiatrists like to,

Speaker 11:         02:43:16       what would you say denigrate Freud, but uh, and I think there's a reason for that. I think that Freud's fundamental insights were so profound and so valuable that they got immediately absorbed into our culture and now they seem self evident and so that all that's left of Freud is his errors because we believe everything else, we believe all the profound things he discovered, we just take them for granted. And so we don't believe the things that he said that weren't quite on the money and that's all we credit with him with now. But he was certainly the first person who brought up the idea of the unconscious in a rigorous manner and he was the first person to do a rigorous examination of dreams because the interpretation of dreams is a great book. It's well worth reading. And he was the first person to note that people were in some sense inhabited by subpersonalities that had a certain degree of autonomy and independent life. Brilliant observation, the cognitive psychologists haven't caught up with that at all, yet.

Speaker 11:         02:44:14       Ewan was profoundly affected by Freud. Jung was profoundly affected by nature and by Freud. Those were his two main intellectual influences. I don't think one more than the other. He split with Freud on the religious issue. That was what caused the disruption in their relationship, and I think it's an extremely interesting historical occurrence. It might be a profound significance. Freud believed that the fundamental myth of the human being was the Eda Pole Myth, and the myth from a broader perspective is a failed hero's story. So the eatable myth is the myth of a man who develops who grows up but then accidentally becomes too close to his mother, sleeps with her. He doesn't know who she is, and as a consequence blinds himself and there's a, there's a, there's a warning about human development going wrong in that story. And I think that Freud put his finger on it extraordinarily well because human beings have a very long period of dependency.

Speaker 11:         02:45:20       And one of the things that you do see in clinical practice is that many people's problems are associated with their inability to break free of their family, like they're consumed by the family drama, right? They can't get beyond what happened to them in their family. They're stuck in the past. It's. And that's, that's equivalent symbolically speaking, you might say to the idea of being too close to your mother of, of, of the boundaries being improperly specified. And that happens far more often than anyone would like to think. As I said, Freud, I thought it was a universal, but you see, he had a different idea. And his idea was that it wasn't the failed hero story. That was the universal human myth. It was the successful hero's story. And that's a difference. I could seriously a big difference because the successful hero's story is remembering sleeping beauty.

Speaker 11:         02:46:18       You may remember this in the Disney movie, the evil queen traps the prince in a dungeon and she's not going to let them out till he's old. Right? And so there's this comical scene where she's down in the dungeon, he's all in chains and she's laughing at him, telling him what his future is going to be like. She's quite evil and you know, she, she paints this wonderful picture of him being freed in like 80 years and hobbling out of the castle on his horse that's so old, he can barely stand up in him with gray hair. And, and you know, she recites the story of his eventual triumphant departure from the castle as a old and decrepit man. And she has a great laugh about it. And it's nice, you know, it's a real punchy story. It's really something wonderful for children. That story and he gets free of the, of the shackles and the things that free him.

Speaker 11:         02:47:11       Our three little female fairies. It's the positive aspect of the feminine that frees him from the dungeon. It's so. It's very interesting and very accurate from a psychological perspective. It's the negative element of the feminine that encapsulates him in the dungeon. And it's the positive element of the feminine that frees him. And then he, he has a queen. The Evil Queen is not very happy when he escapes. You may remember that she stands on top of her castle tower and starts to spin off cosmic sparks. I mean, she's quite the creature enveloped in flame and then she turns into a dragon and she then the prince has to fight with her in order to make contact with sleeping beauty and an awakened her from her comatose existence as her unconscious existence and wants a brilliant. It's a brilliant representation of a successful hero myth. He, he doesn't end up staying in an unholy relationship with his mother.

Speaker 11:         02:48:13       Let's say he escapes and then conquers the worst thing that can be imagined and is ennobled by that and that as a consequence, he's able to wake the slumbering feminine from its coma and that's a union story and that's the story that he juxtaposed against Freud. Freud thought of religious phenomena as part of an occult tide. That would be, that would drown rationale rationality. That's why Freud was so valiantly antireligious and you thought, no, it's not the case. You're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There's something profound and central to the hero. Myth and union clinical work is essentially the awakening of the hero myth in the in the analysis and in the client or the patient

Speaker 12:         02:49:08       to conceptualize yourself as that which can confront chaos and triumph and that that's associated with an ennobling of the Sea of consciousness and the establishment of proper positive relationships between male and female. And you know, I'm a skeptical person. I'm a very, very skeptical person and I've tried with every trick. I have to put a lever underneath young story and lifted up and disrupt it and I, I can't do it. I think he was right in that Freud was wrong. I mean, I have great respect for Freud. I think he got the progam problem diagnosed very, very nicely and in my clinical work, I see the phenomena that Freud described emerge continually, constantly the best. If you're interested in that, there's a documentary you should watch. I may have mentioned it before. I think it's the best documentary ever made. Certainly the best one I've ever seen.

Speaker 12:         02:50:04       It's called crumb and it's about a underground cartoonists. Robert Crumb who who is part of the hippie movement in, although he hated hippies, he was part of the hippie movement in the sixties in San Francisco, and started the entire underground comic, what culture that that manifested itself eventually in graphic novels who's quite a significant figure from the perspective of popular art and a very, very intelligent man and also I would say a hero, although a very bent and depraved and warped one, someone very acutely aware of his own shadow and the documentary outlines his attempts to escape from his absolutely dreadful mother and the failure of his two brothers to do the same thing. One of whom ended up as a street beggar in San Francisco and the other who drank furniture Polish and died six months after the documentary was produced. It's an unbelievably shocking documentary. It's the only piece of film that I've ever seen that captures Friday and pathology.

Speaker 12:         02:51:10       I've never seen anything because he can't see it generally, unless you're in a clinical situation, unless you know the details of someone's lives, the personal intimate details, you cannot communicate it. But the documentary as who made the film was Robert Zweig off, if I remember correctly, was a friend of the crumbs and so he got access in a way that no one else would have, and they're also very forthright and forthcoming about their situation in general. I would highly recommend that it's. It's a real punch. If you want to know how a rapist thinks, like if you actually want to know, because maybe you don't want to know. In fact, you probably don't want to know, right? Because do you really want to know that? Because to understand that means to put yourself in that position and to understand it. If you really want to know how a serial sexual Predator thinks and why. If you watch crum and you pay attention, you'll know and that's only a tiny bit of what the film has to offer. It's really

Speaker 11:         02:52:06       quite remarkable. Anyways, young split with Freud on the issue of the Interpol story as the fundamental myth of humankind and on the issue of the validity of the religious viewpoint and young came down heavily on the side of the validity of the religious viewpoint. And he established that in a book called symbols of transformation, which was written in 1914, and that's the book that broke, that produced the break permanent split with Freud and that book, I would say that books actually been written three times. It was written as symbols of trip four times written as symbols of transformation, which young extensively revised when he was old, and then it was rewritten in is in a sense by a student of young's called Eric Norman, who is also something someone I would really recommend. Eric Norman, I think is [inaudible] greatest student. And he wrote two books. He wrote one called the origins and history of consciousness, which is a description of the development of consciousness out of unconsciousness, using the hero myth as a, as an, as a, as a, as a, what would you say as a, as an interpretive skeleton.

Speaker 11:         02:53:21       So we Newman viewed the hero myth as the dramatized story of the emergence of human consciousness out of the surrounding unconsciousness in which it was embedded. The struggle for consciousness, the struggle of consciousness upward towards the light, like a lotus flower struggles up through the muck and they and the water to to lay itself on the surface of the water and and bloom and reveal the Buddha, which is of course what the lotus flower does from a symbolic perspective and for, for for Norman. The hero's story was the story of the development, the successful development of consciousness and the origins of consciousness. The origins and history of consciousness is a great book. Interestingly, Camille Paglia row read the origins and history of consciousness. She's one of the few mainstream intellectuals that I've ever encountered who read that in commented on it, and she believed that it would be sufficient antidote to postmodern denigration of literature.

Speaker 11:         02:54:22       She thought it was that powerful a work, and I believe that. I think it's a remarkable book. Carl Jung wrote the foreword to that book and he said in the forward that it was the book that he wished he would have written, so sort of like young. He wrote, I don't remember how many volumes, dozens of very thick, difficult volumes. It was like Norman was able to distill those into a single volume statement, and so I would also say if you're interested in young, the best book to read is the origins and history of consciousness. It's the best intro into into the union world, so you. It's very difficult to, very difficult to understand. It requires a real shift of perspective in order to understand what he's talking about, and Norman wrote another book called the great mother, which is a little bit more specialized in some sense, but it's also extremely interesting because it flushes out the archetype of chaos and its representation as feminine and it's a brilliant book as well and highly worth, highly worth reading both those books.

Speaker 11:         02:55:30       Anyways, young was a very strange person and a visionary and and so that's kept them outside of the academic realm almost entirely. I mean, I was constantly warned as an undergraduate and then a graduate student and then a professor against ever talking about young in any way whatsoever. When I went on the job market, when I was at mcgill, when I had graduated from mcgill, I had done my scientific research in Anelka, holism, and I had a fairly lengthy publication record that was pure empirical research and really neuro physiological research into the pharmacology of alcoholism and I established a reasonably solid dossier publications, but at the same time I was writing this book that became maps of meaning and so I split my time in graduate student school between these two endeavors. One very specifically neurological and pharmacological and really biologically based on the other very abstract, religious, symbolic, psychoanalytic, the complete opposite, but I could see that the two things overlapped really nicely and there was a number of scientists at the time that we're also drawing the same conclusions.

Speaker 11:         02:56:43       The same relationship between the biology and the psychoanalysis. Jaak Panksepp, who wrote a book called an affective neuroscience, which is a great classic, is one of those people who who saw the relationship between the neurobiology of emotion and motivation and the psychoanalytic insights never became a mainstream view. But I think it's too complex. I think that bridging the gap between the biology and the and the symbolic is too much for people generally speaking, you know, it was certainly virtually too much for me because I got quite ill when I was a graduate student. I think for a variety of reasons. I also would go out and party three nights a week and so that probably had something to do with it, but, but working on those two things simultaneously was also rather exhausting. Now, you was a tremendously insightful clinician and he was a strange person.

Speaker 11:         02:57:34       Introverted, visionary, high and introversion. Very, very, very, very, very high in openness. Like off the charts and also God only knows what his Iq was. I mean, every time I read it's like reading Nietzsche. It's terrifying because you know, he's, he's so damn smart that he can think up answers to questions that you don't even. It's not like you don't understand the answers is the, you never conceptualized the damn questions. It's really something to read. Someone like that, right? Who says, well, here's a mystery and you think, wow, I never thought of that is a mystery, and here's the solution. It's like, okay, that's. That's, that's something you know, and he could read Greek and he could read. He read all the ancient. He read a very large variety of ancient languages and was very familiar with the entire corpus of of astrological thought and of l chemical thought and of classic literature and Biblical stories and been educated in a way that no one is educated now and so he's very daunting person to encounter and terrifying, absolutely terrifying. His Book Ion, which is the second volume of the second volume of volume nine, which is the archetypes of the collective unconscious. That damn book is just absolutely terrifying because young, he's one of these visionaries who can see way underneath the social structures and look at patterns that are developing across for you in young's case across thousands of years and lays them out and so that's a really. That's really something to to encounter. Ion is a terrifying book.

Speaker 11:         02:59:09       Anyways, one question might be, well, because I read the organ, I think, how the hell did he know these things? How could he figure these things out? I can't understand how he could possibly know these things. Well, here's a partial answer. Young was a visionary, and so what that means as far as I can tell and like we could do a little quick survey here. How many of you think you think in words can put up your hands, do you think in words? Okay, so it looks like. What about pictures? How many of you think in pictures? Okay, so that's interesting. How many of you think that's about half and half by the way? Probably a fewer on the word side. How many of you think in pictures and words?

Speaker 11:         02:59:52       Okay, so all right, so it was roughly a third in each category, but that's also something that I really haven't encountered any research on from the neuropsychological perspective. It's like, well do you think in pictures or do you think ad words and and is that actually a reliable distinction? I think I think in words most of the time, but I can think in pictures like if I'm trying to build something that I can think in pictures very almost instantaneously, but it isn't my natural mode of thinking. I'm hyperverbal and so my natural mode of thinking is to think everything through in words, but I know my wife doesn't like that. She thinks in images and then it has to translate them into words and so anyways, young was very literate and he could really think in words, but he could really think in images. Also talking to my wife quite extensively like her, the intensity of her visualization vastly exceeds mine.

Speaker 11:         03:00:45       So for example, if I close my eyes and then try to imagine the crowd in front of me, it's pretty low resolution and vague and not brilliantly colored and vivid. You know, it's, it's, it's like I'm seeing through a glass darkly, let's. I can't bring images to mind with that with spectacular clarity, but my wife is very good at that and you seem to be absolutely a genius at that kind of thinking. And he had a lot of visionaries in his family history as well, so I don't know to what degree there is a hereditary component of that and I don't know to what degree that's actually a neurological specialization, I presume it would be associated with the trade. Openness distinguishes itself, differentiates itself into interest in ideas and interest in aesthetics. And my suspicion is that the people who are more interested in aesthetics are the visionary types.

Speaker 11:         03:01:34       The ones that think in images anyways, young could really think in images and he could imagine beings. And I had a client once who was a lucid dreamer and how many of you have had a lucid dream so you know you're dreaming while you're many that that phenomena wasn't really even even identified as a phenomena until the end of the 19th century. There was a book written about it that Freud tried to get his hands on but couldn't because it was a very rare book. And then there was a researcher about 30 years ago who started to study lucid dreams. But anyways, I had a client who was a lucid dreamer and one of the things she could do was ask her dream characters what information they were trying to convey and they would tell her. So that was very interesting. And one of the consequences of that was, I don't have the story completely right in my memory, but it's close enough.

Speaker 11:         03:02:30       She was afraid of a very large number of things. And in her dream, I think it was a gypsy standing by a wagon, told her that if she was going to be successful in university, that she would have to visit a slaughterhouse. And that was something that was way beyond her capacity to tolerate. She was a vegetarian, she couldn't stand the sight of raw meat even. And so, and she was very oppressed and depressed and anxious because of the slaughter house nature of existence. And so her dream focused on that. And one of the consequences of that, because the slaughter house was out of the question as a clinical intervention, um, I took her to an embalming, right? Because cause I asked her, I asked her what, what, what might be equivalent to that, and so she suggested that, and you know, exposure therapy is a hallmark of clinical psychology, right?

Speaker 11:         03:03:28       One of the things you do with people as a clinician is you find out what they're afraid of and you gradually and voluntarily expose them to that and that cures them. And that's associated with the hero myth, right? It's exactly the same thing. It's like there's a dragon. It's stopping you because there's lots of dragons. Most of them aren't stopping you. You can ignore them. You don't have to just go, you know, slash away at randomly. You're not supposed to be fighting dragons that aren't in your way, but if they are in your way, you can't ignore them. And then you decompose them into sub dragons and you have people take them on and as they take them on, they dispense with the dragon and they gained the power of the drag. It's like a video game. A video game is like that. That's why people like the video games.

Speaker 11:         03:04:10       Well, that's right, right? There's a reason that you absorb power when you overcome things, when you play a video game. It's not like that's intrinsic to the video game structure. That's an archetypal idea. Anyways, we went and saw an embalming, which was a very interesting experience and, and quite quite useful for her because she knew what she could tolerate after that and it was a hell of a lot more than she thought she could tolerate and so that's very useful to know. Back to you. He's a visionary thinker now. My client, I said she could lose a dream and she could ask her dream characters what they wanted and what they were trying to communicate to her. So that was pretty interesting. That happened spontaneously. Had nothing to do with me. You know, I'm interested in dreams and one of my clients are great dreamers, especially the creative ones because I think it's a hallmark of creativity to have vivid dreams and to be able to remember them.

Speaker 11:         03:05:09       But that was a faculty that was natural to her young. How did this other client at one time, at one point, she had a variety of fears and she had this dream that she told me she was walking down a beach and on the side of the beach up a dune, small Dune. There was this old man with a snake, a big python, and there's a crowd around him. And uh, she was walking by the snake handler and the snake and the crowd and she didn't want to have anything to do with them. He was sort of showing people the snake. And she told me that dream and I thought, well, you know, you probably need to go see that snake. And so I relaxed or quasi hypnotic technique. It's very straightforward. Hypnosis is generally nothing but pronounced relaxation low. You have to be susceptible to hypnosis to actually fall into a hypnotic trance as a consequence of being relaxed or just relaxed her.

Speaker 11:         03:06:06       I had her breathe deeply and pay attention to different parts of her body and just relax their muscles one by one essentially so that she could concentrate. And then I told her, we play with the dream a little bit and say union technique. I said, well, so called the dream image to mind, which she could do quite well. Said, okay, so let's, let's explore it. So like pretend it's like pretend play in. You know, if you're a kid in your pretend playing, you don't exactly direct the game, right you, you, you play the game. So it's partly your direction obviously because you're the player. But the thing also happened spontaneously of its own accord. And you can think about that as a dialogue between the conscious mind and the unconscious mind. In some sense, it's developmental dialogue. It's not a fun game if you just direct it.

Speaker 11:         03:06:51       It's only a fun game if you're inviting and something is welling up as a consequence. It's the same thing that happens when you're, you're engaged in some kind of artistic or literary production. If it's all top down, you know, if you're forcing it, then it's propaganda, it's empty. What do you want to sort of put yourself in a receptive state of mind in an imaginative state of mind? And it's sort of half you and half nature itself, manifesting itself in your creative imagination. And that was the sort of state that we were striving for. And she, I asked her when she was in relaxed, I said, well, what do you think about the snake handler? And she said, well, he's probably a charlatan and he's just there trying to impress the crowd and to show off. And she was afraid to go up there because she thought people would push her towards the snake and she'd have to touch it.

Speaker 11:         03:07:37       And so there was a fear of the crowd issue going on there too. And I said, well just look, go up there, but do it under these conditions is that, you know, if, if people get pushy, what are you going to tell them? And so we figured out something, he said, look, just tell them that you know, you want to look at the snake at your own pace and that you don't need any encouragement or help. And it would be good if you were just left alone. So that enabled her to defend herself. So she was afraid that the crowd would push her to do something that she didn't want to do. That was part of the theme of the dream. So anyways, she eventually climbed the Dune in her imagination and went into the crowd and the crowd turned out to be quite welcoming and not hostile and not pushy, which isn't what you'd expect, right?

Speaker 11:         03:08:18       Because the, you'd think the crowd would have reacted in accordance with their fears since it was her fantasy. But that's the thing about fantasies. They have this autonomous quality, but the crowd was welcoming and not hostile and it turned out that the snake handler wasn't a charlatan. He was just an old guy who had this snake and he was out there just showing it to people because he thought it was a cool thing and, and, and that maybe it was good for people to come and look at a snake. And so she got close enough to the snake to touch it. And so. So I'm telling you that because I want you to understand a bit more about what union was trying to do. And so he wrote these books, notebooks that haven't been published yet, called the block books, and the black books are the documentation of his experiments with his imagination and what he would do is Adrian, like, like a child daydreams.

Speaker 11:         03:09:10       He regained that faculty, although I think with you. And it was a faculty that has never really disappeared and he had figures of imagination that came to him that he could speak with. And he spoke with these figures of imagination and documented that over a very long period of time. And that was originally, that was eventually distilled into a book called the Red Book, which was published about three or four years ago. And it was a book that young regarded as the central source from which all his inspiration emerged. There was sort of the way it looks to me is that we embody

Speaker 4:          03:09:54       a lot of information in our action, right? And our action has developed as a consequence of imitating other people. And not only the people or the people around us, but of course the people around us imitated the people who came before them. And those people in mutated the people who came before them and so on so far back that it's as far back as you can go, and so you embody these patterns of behavior that are extremely informative, that you don't understand, that are a consequence of collective imitation across the centuries and throw. Then those patterns can become manifest as figures of the imagination and those failures of imagination are the distillations of patterns of behavior and so as the distillations of patterns of behavior, they have content and it's not you that content. It's you could even think about it as content that's evolved.

Speaker 4:          03:10:46       Although it's culturally transmitted, it's content that's evolved and so these figures of the imagination can reveal the structure of reality to you. And that's what happened with young and that's what he described in the red book. And that was what permeated his psychology. Psychology. That was based on the presupposition that the fundamental architectural structures of religious belief. We're not pathological, not deceitful, not protective in some delusional sense against the fear of death, but quite the contrary, the very stories that enabled us to move forward as confident human beings in the face of chaos itself and it's conceivable, I think perhaps probable that nothing more important conceptually happened in the 20th century than that because it was the first time post enlightenment that Ab reproachment between the intellect and the underlying religious archetipal substructure occurred. You have in the capacious intellect of young and the same thing happened to some degree with piaget. The religious domain and the factual domain were brought back together and the fact of young's enduring and increasing popularity and influence, I would say is a direct consequence of that. Now.

Speaker 4:          03:12:18       Some of his work was spun off into the new age and and the new age is a very optimistic and naive movement is predicated on the idea that you can do nothing say, but follow your bliss and that will take you ever hire to enlightenment. And that's not the union idea at all. The union idea is that what you most need will be found where you least want to look. So there's this story. King Arthur, there's this story of King Arthur, the. They're all in a round table, right? King Arthur and his knights, they're equals. They're all

Speaker 11:         03:12:52       super ordinary, but they're all equals and they go off to look for the holy Grail, for the holy grail is the container of the redemptive substance, whatever that is might be the cop of the Christ used at the last supper, might be jealous that was used to capture his blood on the cross, right when he was pierced by a sword. The stories differ, but that's the holy grail and the holy grail is lost. That's the redemptive substance and the knights of King Arthur go off to search for the holy grail and but they don't know where to look. So where do you look when you don't know where to look for something you need desperately, but I've lost. Well, each of the nights goes into the forest at the point that looks darkest to him, and that's union psychoanalysis in a nutshell. It's like that which you fear and avoid that which you hold in contempt, that which disgusts you and that you avoid. That's the gateway to what you need to know. There's nothing new agey about that. That's for sure. Now, young, when he started this endeavor, he started with this. This is part of the notebooks from the black book. He said,

Speaker 11:         03:14:06       he wrote my soul, my soul. Where are you? Do you hear me? I speak. I call you. Are you there? I've returned. I'm here again. I've shaken the dust of all the lands from my feet and I've come to you. I'm with you. After long years of long wandering, I have come to you again for the unions. The Hero's journey is a journey within and I think that that's probably the bias of introverts to believe that the hero's journey isn't only an inward journey. I think that it can be an outward journey too because I don't think it matters where you confront the unknown, whether it's within or without. What matters is whether or not you confront the unknown. That's what matters,

Speaker 11:         03:15:01       but he found that what he had ignored was an undiscovered part of themselves, so that might be something that was equivalent to Huxley's notion that there were tremendous. There's tremendous potential breadth in the realm of human conscious experiences. Huxley was influenced to some degree by Yung now Yung knew of Huxley's experiments and had commented on psychedelic use and he said something like, beware of wisdom you did not earn. And Don was very good. It's at stating things very profoundly, very simply, and that's a very intelligent piece of advice. Beware of wisdom you did not earn. He wrote a paper if you're interested in this sort of thing. He wrote a paper called the relations between the ego and the unconscious, which is an absolute work but completely incomprehensible unless you know what it, unless you know what it's about and what it's about is the danger of what he called ego inflation.

Speaker 11:         03:15:58       And so one of the things that can happen as a consequence of a revelatory experience is that the division between the individual ego and and the and what would you call it? So hard to come up with a word that isn't somehow naive or or or cliched, to erase the relationship, the boundary between the specific consciousness of the ego and the more generalized consciousness and more generalized consciousness as such is a dangerous thing to do because you can start to equate yourself, your specific self with that more generalized consciousness as such and you thought about that, is it something akin to a psychotic inflation and the paper relations between the ego and the unconscious is a document that tells you how to avoid that. If you're playing in this kind of realm and one of the injunctions is to keep your feet on the ground. He thought that was partly what happened to Nisha was that Nisha wasn't grounded enough in life. He wasn't grounded enough in day to day rituals and routines and the mundane. Now you can debate whether or not that's the case. Whether or not that's a reasonable argument, but that was still what you unbelieved. Okay, so why am I telling you all this?

Speaker 11:         03:17:27       I'll finish with this from December 19, 13 onward. Young carrier going in the same procedure, deliberately evoking a fantasy in a waking state and then entering into it as a drama. These fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form. In retrospect, he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness. The example of dreams indicated the existence of background activity and he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging just as one does when taking masculine. These journals are contemporary contemporaneous clinical ledger to his most difficult experiment or what he later describes as a voyage of discovery to the other pole of the world. You don't believe that we were dreaming all the time, but that during waking life, that pressure of external images was such that the unconscious fantasy imagery was or that the fantasy imagery was of insufficient magnitude to be conscious, but that we were always situated in a dream in relationship to the world.

Speaker 5:          03:18:29       If you're hungry, it's not a deterministic drive. It's a sub personality that has a goal and that it has a bunch of action patterns that are going to work in reference to that goal. It has a bunch of perceptions that that suit that goal and it organizes your emotional responses around that goal. And so to think about it as a personality is a much. It's a much more intelligent way to look at it. One of the thing about skinner's rats, you know, skinner could get rats to do almost everything and he would reward them with food and so he had a simple rat model, but his rats were starved down to 75 percent of their normal body weight. So not only were they not social gregarious rats, rats are because they were isolated. They were genetically altered from wild rats, but they also weren't as complex as a real route because they were starving.

Speaker 5:          03:19:16       And so, but you know, starving rat is a pretty good model of a rat. And a rat has a pretty good model of a person, but are a lot of our models have simple behavioral learning were based on starving isolated rats. So anyways, how to think about motivation will think about it from the hypothalamic perspective. So we could say one thing that motivation does is set goals and we could say that emotions track progress towards goals, and I'm going to use that Schema even though it's not exactly right. So you say, well, motivation determines where you're going to aim. So if you're hungry, you're going to aim at something to eat and then that will organize your perceptions so that you zero out everything that isn't relevant to that task, which is almost everything. You concentrate on those few things that are going to facilitate your movement forward.

Speaker 5:          03:20:02       When you encounter those things that produces positive emotion, as you move through the world towards your goal and you see that things are laying themselves out that facilitate your movement forward, those things caused positive emotion and if you encounter anything that gets in the way, then that produces negative emotion and it can be like threat because you're not supposed to encounter something that gets in the way. It can be anger so that you move it away. It can be frustration, disappointment, grief. Those would, if you had a response that serious to an obstacle, it would probably punish the little motivated frame right out of existence, you know, so you walked downstairs and I dunno, they're contracting company instead of wrecking ball through your kitchen, it's like that's going to be disappointing. You're not going to keep eating the peanut butter sandwich and the rubble, that little frame is going to get punished out of existence and some new goal is going to pop up and its stead and you know, one of the things we're going to try to sort out is how do you decide when you've encountered an obstacle that's so big that you should just quit and go do something else because that's not obvious, you know, and you can, you can get into counter productive persistence pretty easily.

Speaker 5:          03:21:08       So we don't know how people solve that problem and it's a really complicated one. So anyways, we're gonna work on that scenario. Your hypothalamus pops up micro goals that are directly relevant to biological survival that produces a frame of reference. So it's not a goal, it's not a drive and it's not a collection of behaviors. It's a little personality and the personality has a viewpoint. It has thoughts that go along with it. It has perceptions, it has action tendencies, all of that. You can see this in addiction most particularly, so one of the things that you find often with people who are alcoholic is they lie all the time and that's because when they're built a little alcohol dependent personality inside of themselves or a big one might. Maybe it's 90 percent of their personality and one of that. One of the things that component consists of is all the rationalizations that they've used over the years to justify their addiction to themselves and to other people.

Speaker 5:          03:22:07       And so the addiction has a personality, you know, and so when the person is off or maybe they're addicted to meth or something like that, where we know the addiction is more. It's more short term powerful than I would say, than an alcohol addiction and they'll say anything and the the, the words are just tools used to get towards the goal and if they happened to be deceptive, whatever, it doesn't matter. They're just practical tools to get towards the goal. And then when you get towards the goal and you take a nice shot of meth or something like that, you reinforce all those rationales that you use to get the drug and then the next time you're even a better deceiver and liar. So okay, so we're going to say motivations one way of thinking about as they set goals, but it's not the right way of thinking about it.

Speaker 5:          03:22:50       They produce a whole framework of interpretation. And so we're going to think about that framework of interpretation and then emotions emerging side of that. So that's it. So the world is framed. Motivations, set goals. You could say the world has to be framed. So motivation sets that frame, cruise goals, emotions, perceptions and actions and inactions track progress. So positive emotion says you're moving forward properly towards your goal. And if you encounter something you don't expect, you stop that anxiety. It's like, oh, we're not where we thought we were. And so we don't know what to do, so we should stop because we don't know where we are, what we're doing. Stop frozen. And then the more powerful negative emotions like pain they might make you get out of there. So motions forward, stop, reverse. That's your emotions within that motivated frame. So, and that's another example of how your mind is embedded in your body.

Speaker 5:          03:23:45       Your emotions are in like their, their offshoots of action tendencies. That's, that's the right way to think about it because action has everything fundamentally. So what are some basic motivations are most of these are regulated by the Hypothalamus, by the way, that that tells you just how important to control system it is. The other thing that's useful to know about the hypothalamus is that it has projections going up from it that are like tree trunks and inhibitory projections coming down there. They're like grape vines. So you can kind of control your hypothalamus as long as it's not on too much, but if it's on in any serious way, it's like it. It winds. So partly what you do to stop yourself from falling under the dominion of your hypothalamus is to never, ever be anywhere where it's action is necessary. Right? You don't want to go into a biker bar because you might find yourself in a situation where panicked.

Speaker 5:          03:24:38       Defensive aggression is immediately necessary. You probably don't want that. You don't want to panic. You don't want the terror. You don't want the frenzied fight. You don't want any of that. You don't want to have to run away in absolute panic, so you just don't go there. And then a huge, a huge part of how we regulate our emotions is just by never going anywhere where we have to experience them and so that has very little to do with internal inhibitory control and everything to do with staying where you belong. So okay, so basic motivations, hunger, thirst, pain, pain is not regulated by the hypothalamus. That's a different circuit. Anger slash aggression, thermo regulation, panic and escape, affiliation and care, sexual desire, exploration play, and you can kind of break those in. You can kind of break those into the classic Darwinian categories to and say, well, there's a set of motivations that go along with self maintenance. That'd be your survival, ingestive and defensive. See, I've sort of coded them there. So the self maintenance, there's an adjustive set of basic motivations that go with self maintenance. You'd say that's hunger, thirst. There's a set of defensive motivations, pain, anger, thermoregulation paddock and escape. And then there's, there's motivations that are associated with reproduction, affiliation care and sexual desire. And then I put exploration in place sort of outside of that. Uh, I would say because those two things serve both of these approximately equally,

Speaker 7:          03:26:17       I think the postmodern objection to meaning is actually wrong. While we talked about this earlier, I do believe that there's a transcendent ethic and I do believe that it touches on the metaphysical. I believe it people experienced that because people are perfectly capable of having unalterably profound religious experiences and the naturalistic materialists don't know what the hell to do with that. They have no idea what to do with that. Say, well, it's delusional. It's like, well, hang on a sec. People who have those experiences appear to be more successful and healthier. So when exactly in what manner is that delusion, and if you induce it in the lab with Psilocybin, for example, among people who are dying of cancer, their fear of death goes away. It's like that's you're going to just lay of the lay that out there as delusional or yo the quit smoking, 85 percent success rate with one mystical experience on suicide, but produces 85 percent cessation rate and smoking completely and with a Mtma ecstasy. The three treatments with Mtma, that's what the current research indicates, produces a 72 percent cure rate for intractable posttraumatic stress disorder. It's like those are miracle cures and no one, and they have to be accompanied by the mystical experience. No one knows how to counsel them. And so there is a transcender yeah. So it's a very physical thing. I mean in the case or any of these things, right? You're eating

Speaker 5:          03:27:41       something, you're ingesting saying smoking it, whatever it is, it's physical, it's here and now. But the experience is metaphysical is metaphor. Sure. That's a place where the biological and the transcendent touch and we don't know what to make of that. Well, that's why psychedelics through our culture into such a such a flip this upside down, no one knew what to do with them. No, I mean the Indians retarded psilocybin as food of the gods for a reason, and when people have encountered psychedelic substances throughout human history, that's always how they've been characterized. Right. Food of the gods. It's like be aware of them, but there they opened the door to the transcendent and well, I think the evidence that they are doing something that's psychedelic substances are doing something that we seriously don't understand at all. Not a bit is overwhelming. Rick strassman wrote a book on his experiences giving Dmt to a whole bunch of people down in.

Speaker 5:          03:28:34       He was at in Austin. I think it's stress. One's a pretty straight scientists, you know, he was interested in measuring psychophysiological responses to the drugs. He gives people dmt and they all came back with the same story. I was blasted out of my consciousness. I went, I met a whole bunch of alien beings. They were really surprised. I was there and then I came back and it was the most real thing that's ever happened to me, and straussman would say, well, you know, you had a union architectural experience, or it was a dream and they'd say, you don't understand, and he got so distraught because of these continual reports that he had stopped doing the research. Yeah. I'm not making a claim for him for anything metaphysical here, but I'm definitely pointing out that there are undeniable realms of human experience that involve religious experience and a sense of the infinite transcendent that looked like they're healthy and that you cannot deny.

Speaker 3:          03:29:44       So you see on the left hand side there you see horace, who is the bird headed god of Egypt, who I told you about, who represents the capacity to pay attention. Very important concept because the Egyptians realized in really it's brilliant. There's something modern people do not understand because we tend to make rationality the highest God. That's not a good thing. That's a pathway to totalitarianism. What the Egyptians knew, but they only knew it in symbolic form was it was the capacity to attend to things that in some sense was the highest psychological function because it's the capacity to pay attention that actually moves you beyond what you only know and rationality tends to make you know, integral systems that are coherent, that are box like and then claim that they're absolutely right. Whereas attention is always looking beyond what you know and and attention is an unbelievably powerful force. You know, that's why advertisers pay for

Speaker 5:          03:30:40       it. That's why people demand it. That's why children can't live without it. That's why it's what you want from your friends and your family. You want them to pay attention to you. It's an unbelievably valuable resource. And so one of the things I always tell my clients, for example, if they're socially anxious, I say, look, pay more attention to the person you're talking to. If you pay, if you really pay close attention to them than the thoughts that are making you anxious will be suppressed. And because you're paying close attention to them, you'll match your movements to theirs and you'll match your conversation to them and then there's no reason for you to be socially anxious because socially anxious people will go like this when they're talking, you know, they don't want to look at you. Of course, how the hell can you engage anyone if you're not in a little dance with them, you know, you can't. And a lot of it's nonverbal, it's physical and it's embodied and without paying attention. Then you lose people and you see this with speakers all the time. Cue there in front of audiences. They have their paper and they're going like this. And usually they're talking like this too. And you know, the logical thing to do in that case is like, look at facebook or get the hell out of there something. But they're not paying attention to the audience. And so there's no power in the. There's no power in the dynamic conversation at all.

Speaker 16:         03:31:55       One of the experiences that I had when I was a 1985 or thereabouts when I was working on the first draft of my book maps of meaning where I was outlining this idea that the path of the hero who voluntarily confronts uncertainty and stands on the border between chaos and order, the appropriate target for human development. It's, it's an alternative to the chaos of nihilism and totalitarianism of rigid belief. Yes. So, and that's the bearing of responsibility for being. I was working all of that out. It's actually announced it to the post modern conundrum as far as I can tell as well. But, but anyways, at the same time I was making this sculpture, which is about a foot thick. It's made out of layers of, of what's called foam core, which is styrofoam press between two pieces of paper. That's about a quarter of an inch thick.

Speaker 16:         03:32:52       And so often used for backing on, on, uh, on prints and so on. If you get them framed, I made this, this piece that I called the meaning of music and it's a Mandela. So it's a circle inscribed inside of the square. Although I tried to make it multidimensional in a complex way that I can't really describe at the moment, but what I was trying to do and I broke it into pieces of what I was trying to do was to produce a visual, a object that flickered and changed when you looked at it because it was too complex to process visually. You know, like a necker cube. That's one of those cubes that reversed is when you look at it. Yeah. Well this is like a necker cube on steroids

Speaker 17:         03:33:39       because music of course it stays the same across time, but also transform across time and it's full of layered patterns, you know, and the patterns interact harmoniously with one another. And it had appeared and I was fascinated by music because it gives people the direct intimation of meaning. Even if they're nihilistic punk rockers, they still can't criticize the experience of meaning that they, that they, that they engage in when they're listening to their favorite band and it helps them transcend the denialism of rationality. And if you can't argue with it, it's like arguing with dance beyond argument. And so I was making this, this sculpture, and I spent like four months on it. I was thinking about it a lot and I got it mostly assembled and then I was in my living room in Montreal and I was listening to Mozart Symphony, the Jupiter symphony, and I was really listening to it and it's one of these complex Lee multilevel pattern pattern pieces of auditory sculpture that I believe represents being because what being is is multiple levels of patterned transformation interact and simultaneously and music is a representation of that, which is why people find a meaningful.

Speaker 17:         03:35:03       Anyways. I was listening intently to this symphony and at the same time I was concentrating on the sculpture that I have made. All of a sudden, everything I'm about to say is a metaphor because. Because there's no way of encapsulating it properly in words, but it was as if the heavens opened up above. I mean I was still in my living room, but yes, it reminds me. Experience is best represented by one of those early renaissance paintings where you see God or Christ up in the sky with an opening in the sky against the clouds and against the sun, so it was like that even though I didn't really see that, but it felt like that and there was some visuals that were associated with it and I felt something descend upon me that it had a personal nature, you know, something like what you were describing as a higher consciousness that was actually a being of a sort and it failed me from the inside out and I had the and it was. It was enrapturing, let's say, and it was an incredible feeling. It was a divine feeling, I suppose is the right way of thinking about it. Certainly a religious experience.

Speaker 17:         03:36:21       I was an it transform me and turned me into something far more than I than I normally was and maybe you can take them out that as an intimation of what you could become if you worked on it for the rest of your life. Sometimes I think hallucinogens providing people with an image of who they could be a shared goal, them, they're dead wood, right. Anyways, it was as if an offer is being made to me that I could be like that from now on permanently.

Speaker 16:         03:36:52       Well, I don't know how to do that. I couldn't walk down the street in this condition, in this elevated condition.

Speaker 17:         03:37:00       I wouldn't belong in the world anymore. I, I wouldn't. I wouldn't know how to function. I don't know how I could do it and stole the experience. This thing say that was communicating with me was accepted that as an answer, although I would say with some sort of it. And then I went and talked to my waist and I told her what had happened and I was shaking a lot and like a tremendous amount and my pupils were completely dilated. Wow. Yeah. And that happened to me one other time in a similar manner, although it's more like an echo. It wasn't quite as intense, but you know, I was concentrating very much on trying to understand the meaning, the central meaning of music and of course this phenomena of meaning itself and it seemed like the combination of that intense concentration and the visual stimulation and the music all culminated to produce this transformation of consciousness. But that was, that was its nature.

Speaker 16:         03:38:11       I haven't either. Miscarry mushrooms are often buy, buy mushrooms, like silicide, but yes, those substances are to call them strange is barely to scrape the surface.

Speaker 18:         03:38:22       Have you, have you taken psychedelics? Yes, I have. Um, and yeah, so it sounds like it because. Exactly, yes. You're right there. It's such a, it's an, it's this straight. It's the strangest of things. And, and when it comes to identity in the psychedelics affect on human identity, uh, it does create an experience that is transcendent to the very temporary human form that we're currently within.

Speaker 16:         03:38:54       Yes. Well, there's a psychiatrist named Rick Strassman. Yes. Was at the University of Texas and he had been giving his experimental subjects. He's one of two groups that have got permission to start experimenting with psychedelics. Again, the other one was a group at Johns Hopkins who have been recording, um, the consequences of giving experimental subjects a suicide than yes, in a, in its chemical form they report, they've reported, um, permanent personality transformations on the part of their, of the people who took the psilocybin mushrooms who had a experience. And so what's happened to them apart from the fact that they regarded the experience as one of the top two or three experiences of their life in terms of transformation, is that when you give them personality tests a year later, these are five factor personality tests and they test extroversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness and openness is a creativity dimension, an aesthetic experience, creativity, dimension, and their scores on openness increased substantially approximately the equivalent from the 50th percentile to the 85th percentile, which is one standard deviation.

Speaker 16:         03:40:16       They increase and stay that way up to one year later. So these, these, these chemicals, these strange chemicals produced very long lasting effects on people's perception and they do produce intimations of mystical experience. Now, strassman actually got scared away from his DMT research. Um, he was a pretty, I would say, conservative scientist and was administering dmt intravenously because it has a very short half life if you take it any other way. It only lasts about 10 minutes and his people every and who were very carefully screened to begin with for sanity and so forth. Although they have some experience with psychedelic drugs because they didn't want to introduce naive people to, to anything like that. They all reported being shot out of their body and encountering alien beings, all of them. And they, you know, when straussman attempted to explain that away as a, well, let's call it a hallucination.

Speaker 16:         03:41:19       Although technically if you're hallucinating, you know that you're hallucinating and you know what's real. So these were far deeper than hallucination, right? Or that they were something like young Ian Archetypes, but his subjects insisted that including people who knew quite a bit about archetipal psychology insisted that that was not correct, that they were in fact shot out of their bodies into other spaces and dimensions and that they encountered beings of all sorts of different types. Some of whom were surprised to see them. Some of whom were happy they were there, some of whom engaged them in conversation. Um, I mean it makes very strange reading it and it, it. There's no straightforward may way of making sense of it and there's no straightforward way of making sense of the shamanic experiences to Eliana thought that, that those, those rituals have been if, if they were induced by drugs, that that was a corrupt form of the original ritual, but I think later scholarship is indicated that that's profoundly wrong and that's the basis of these experiences is in fact hallucinogenic experience of the sort say that the aztecs induced with siliciden mushrooms or masculine.

Speaker 11:         03:42:42       The first thing I'll do is tell you a story about female neurologist whose name escapes me at the moment. She wrote a book called my stroke of insight. Jill bolty I think is her name and she was a harvard trained. She was, she had, she had medical training from Harvard in neuropsychological function and knew a lot about hemispheric specialization. We talked a little bit about hemispheric specialization before and one of the ways of conceptualizing the difference between the two hemispheres is that the left hemisphere operates in known territory and the right hemisphere operates in unknown territory. That's one way of thinking about or the left hemisphere operates in the orderly domain. In the right hemisphere, operates in the chaotic domain or the left hemisphere operates in the domain of detail, and the right hemisphere operates in the domain of the large picture. It's something like that.

Speaker 11:         03:43:36       Now people differ in their neurological wiring, so those are over generalizations, but that's okay. We're. We'll live with that for the time being. It's certainly not an overgeneralization to point out that you do in fact have two hemispheres and that their structures differ and if the connections between the market, which could happen, for example, if you had surgery for intractable epilepsy, that each hemisphere would be capable of housing its own consciousness that's been well documented by a neuro neuro neurologist named Monica who did and Sperry who did split brain experiments must be 30 years ago now. So, and we know that the right and the left hemisphere are specialized for different functions. The Right Hemisphere, for example, seems to be more involved in degeneration of negative emotion and the left hemisphere more involved in the generation of positive emotion and approach. So the right hemisphere stops you in the left hemisphere, moves you forward.

Speaker 11:         03:44:27       Anyways, Jill Bolty, I hope I've got that right, had a stroke and maintained consciousness during the stroke and analyzed it while it was happening and she was able. Well, it was happening to hypothesize about what part of her brain was being destroyed and so she had a congenital blood vessel malformation and had an aneurysm and it just about killed her, but she said that it effected her left hemisphere and she said that she experienced a sense of divine unity as a consequence of the stroke because the left hemisphere function was disrupted and destroyed and so she became a right hemisphere dominant and her experience of that was the dissolution of the specific ego into the, into absolute consciousness, something like that. Now that's only a case study and you don't want to make too much of studies, but there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that those two kinds of consciousness exist.

Speaker 11:         03:45:37       One being your consciousness of you as a localized and specified being and the other being this capacity to experience oceanic disillusion and the sense of the cosmos being one. Now why we have those capacities for different conscious experiences is very difficult to understand. I mean, part of me thinks that maybe we have a generic human brain that's the brain of the species and allied with that we have a specific individual brain and one is the left hemisphere and the other is the right hemisphere, the left hemisphere of being the specific individual brain and usually it's on and working because you obviously have to take care of yourself as a specific entity and not as a generalized cosmic phenomena. It's hard to dice salary when you're a generalized cosmic phenomena, right? So you have to be more pointed than that, but, but look, let's make no mistake about it.

Speaker 11:         03:46:41       The fact that those different states of consciousness exist is not disputable. They can be elicited in all sorts of ways, and so I'm going to read you something that Elvis Huxley wrote about this back, I think in 1956. This was after he started his experimentation with masculine because the psychedelics were introduced into Western culture in the 19 fifties and a whole bunch of different ways. So as I've been mushrooms, LSD was discovered right after the end of World War II was discovered by accident, actually laboratory sandow was labs. The guy who discovered it, Albert Hoffman had spilled some on his hands. You can absorb it through your skin, and he was biking home and had the world's first LSD trip, which was somewhat of a shock to him and then to the entire world. Huxley, who was a great literary figure, a real genius, experimented with Mescaline in the late fifties and he wrote a book called the doors of perception, which had a huge impact on the emerging psychedelic culture, both on the east coast, it at Harvard and on the West Coast with Ken Keasy and is Mary Pranksters.

Speaker 11:         03:47:53       The people who popularized lsd. That's all documented in a book called the electric koolaid acid test, which I would highly recommend. It's Tom Wolfe. It's brilliant book. I'm on the east coast. It was timothy leary. I had timothy leary's old job at Harvard, so that was kind of cool, you know, warped way, so I met people there who knew him, who didn't think much of them also, but who did know him, but Huxley had this masculine experience and it transported him to this alternative consciousness and he said that during his masculine experience, the entire world glowed from within. Like if there was an inner light like a paradise inner light, and then everything was deeply meaningful and symbolically suggestive and overwhelming and beautiful and timeless, so he had an experience of divine eternity, I suppose is the most straightforward way to to put that, and we know perfectly well that the psychedelic drugs that all share the same chemical structure, they interact with the brain chemical called Serotonin, which is a very, very fundamental neurotransmitter.

Speaker 11:         03:48:58       They all have approximately the same range of effects, although those effects are very. There's a very large multitude of effects that sort of exist underneath that umbrella. Huxley was staggered by his masculine experience. He, he didn't really know what to make of it and I think that that's the common experience of people who have exceptionally profound psychedelic experiences, and I'll, I'll, I'll tell you some documentation about that in a moment, but he spent quite a long time trying to come to grips with what this might mean from an intellectual perspective and in Huxley had a great brain. I mean, if someone was going to wrestle with a problem like that, he was a good candidate. He must've had a verbal Iq of 180. I mean he's. His books are incredibly literate, incredible credible, mastery of language and complexity of characterization and intellectual discourse. Really remarkable.

Speaker 11:         03:49:58       So this is what Huxley actually had to say after his masculine experience. He talked about heaven and hell and he talked about that in reference to bad trips, essentially because it was known by that point that a psychedelic experience could transport you to an ecstatic domain of divine revelation, but could take you to the worst imaginable place as well, and Huxley was very interested in why you would even have the capacity for experiences like that and which I think is a very good question and it's completely unanswered question. I mean, we don't know much about consciousness and we know even less about psychedelics. I would say they are an absolute mystery. I don't think we understand them in the least. Huxley did a good job of starting to at least map out the mysteries of the terrain. He said like the earth of 100 years ago, our minds still has its darkest Africa's.

Speaker 11:         03:50:47       It's unmapped, Borneo and Amazonian Basin in relation to the fauna of these regions. We are not yet zoologists. We are mere naturalists and collectors of specimens. The fact is unfortunate, but we have to accept it. We have to make the best of it. However, lowly the work of the collector must be done before we can proceed to the higher scientific tasks of classification, analysis, experiment and theory making like the giraffe and the duck billed. Platypus. The creatures inhabiting these remoter regions of the mind are exceedingly improbable. Nevertheless, they exist. They're facts of observation, and as such, they cannot be ignored by anyone who was honestly trying to understand the world in which he lives.

Speaker 11:         03:51:34       When psychiatrist started to study lsd that was mostly in the late fifties and running forward from that, they thought about the drug as a psychotomimetic, which was a chemical substance that would induce psychosis, but that turned out to not be true, not with the psychedelics because schizophrenia were given lsd and the schizophrenia reported that while the experience experience was certainly extraordinarily strange, it wasn't like being schizophrenia and then it was found later that if you gave schizophrenia amphetamines, that made them worse. In fact, you can induce a paranoid psychosis in a normal person by overdosing them with amphetamines, so whatever the hallucinogens or psychedelics are doing, it's not the same thing as mania and it's not the same thing as schizophrenia, not at all, so,

Speaker 11:         03:52:38       so you can't just write the experience off as an induced psychosis, whatever it is, independent of its utility or lack thereof. It's not that now it can be induced by drugs can be induced by deprivation, right? I mean there are accounts throughout history of people putting themselves in extreme physiological situations in order to induce transformations of consciousness. Fasting is one of the routes to doing that. Dancing is another root. Isolation. Prolonged periods of isolation will also do it. Now you could say that exposing yourself to any of those in excess produces a state that's in distinguishable from illness and that there's no reason to assume that the phenomena that are associated with illness have any utility whatsoever. Although it's interesting to me that

Speaker 11:         03:53:39       a disrupted consciousness can produce coherent experiences. It's not exactly what you expected was just an illness. You know, if you develop, say, a high fever, your experience isn't transcendent and coherent. It's fragmented and pathologized and and the difference I think is quite distinct, although we don't only have to only speculate about that because there's been enough experimental work done now with with hallucinogens psychedelics to indicate that the notion that what they produce is something that's only akin to pathology is wrong because it's not a matter of opinion at this point in the sequence of scientific and historical investigation. In fact, there was a large scale study done 10 years ago, five years ago, of 200,000 people who had experimented with psychedelics and they were mentally and physically healthier than people who hadn't on virtually every parameter. They examined, in fact the rate of flashbacks. You've heard of LSD flashbacks, that mostly a hypothetical phenomena, but the rate of self reported flashbacks was higher among the non psychedelic users that among the psychedelic users, so that was very interesting. It was a huge study. Now, it might be, you could say that those who had experimented with psychedelics were prone to be healthier to begin with, but that still contradicts the pathology argument, so it doesn't matter either way. The pathology argument is contradicted now.

Speaker 11:         03:55:13       Oh, I did put that in. It was Dr Jill, Jill Bolte Taylor. This is what she said about her stroke. I remember that first day of the stroke with terrific, bitter sweetness in the absence of the normal functioning of my left Orientation Association area. My perception of my physical boundaries was no longer limited to where my skin met air. I felt like a genie liberated from its bottle. It's a good metaphor. The energy of my spirits seemed to flow like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria. The absence of physical boundary was one of glorious bliss. Recently is Dr Roland Griffith.

Speaker 11:         03:55:55       I met him once at a conference in San Francisco. Surprise, surprise, a conference on awe, and this was just when he was embarking on his experiments with Psilocybin, which were the first experiments on hallucinogens that were permitted by the National Institute of Mental Health in some three, four decades. He, he had to be very careful to lay out the scientific protocols so that the ethics committees would approve the experiments and so that the federal funding agencies would also allow the experiments to go through. He started to experiment with psilocybin and he's found a number of published, a number of very interesting results. One was that a single siliciden trip and I specified trip because sometimes when people take psilocybin out, the doses that griffith uses, they don't have a psychedelic experience. Most people who take the dose do but not everyone. Those who take the dos and don't have the mystical experience don't experience the consequences of taking the drug and the consequences can be quite profound. So one consequence is that if you have the mystical experience that's associated with suicide and ingestion, you're liable to represent that to others and yourself. One of the two or three most important experiences of your entire life, so that would be at the same level as the birth of your child or your marriage, let's say assuming that those were transcendent experiences, but, but that's. But that's how people describe them. So that's very interesting in and of itself.

Speaker 11:         03:57:42       Then the next thing that griffith, another thing that Griffith report, it was that one year after a silicide been dose a single psilocybin dose profound enough to induce a mystical experience. That trait openness of the participants had increased one standard deviation, which is a tremendous amount, and so it looked like one dose produced a permanent neurological and psychological transformation. Now I'm not saying that that's a good thing. I'm not saying that because I don't think that openness is a n troubled blessing, but it's certainly a testament to the unbelievable potency of the, of the drugs. There's about a 10 percent chance, by the way, with suicide ingestion of a trip to hell. And so that's certainly something very much worth considering when you're thinking about the potential effects of, of this kind of experience.

Speaker 11:         03:58:43       So the mystical experience produced by Psilocybin is rated by people as the most profound, among the most profound experience of their life as life changing. It produces permanent personality transformations. 80 five percent success in smoking cessation with a single dose, right? That's another thing that griffiths demonstrated. Now that is mind boggling because there are chemical treatments for smoking cessation. Buproprion is one. It reduces craving to some degree, but it's success rate is nowhere near 85 percent, certainly not with a single dose, and so we don't understand how it can be that that occurs, but it's nicely documented by Griffith team in this experiment he gave suicide, been to people who are dying of cancer.

Speaker 11:         03:59:38       Cancer patients often develop chronic clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Previous study suggested Siliciden may decrease depression and anxiety and cancer patients. Aldous Huxley took Lsd on his death bed by the way. So the idea that there was something about psychedelic substances that could buffer people against the catastrophes of mortality is an idea that's as old as experimentation with the drug itself. The effects of Psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life threatening diagnosis and symptoms of depression and slash or anxiety. Unsurprisingly, I don't really know if it's reasonable to describe the emotional state of people diagnosed with cancer of uncertain prognosis or mortal significance as depression. Precisely. You know, you know what I mean is that if you go to the doctor and he tells you that you have intractable fatal cancer, the normative response is to be rather upset and anxious about that and so it. One of the things that bothers me about clinical psychiatry and clinical psychology is the automatic presupposition that even overwhelming states of negative emotion are properly categorized as depression because I don't think you're depressed when you get a cancer diagnosis. I don't think that's the right way to think about it. I think that you have a big problem and it's not surprising that you're overwhelmed by negative emotion and to think about that as a psychiatric malfunction is a major error, but anyways, it's a side issue. With regards to this study.

Speaker 11:         04:01:19       The effects of Psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life threatening diagnosis and symptoms of depression and slash or anxiety. I cannot imagine how they got this through an ethics committee. It's just we're going to take people who have uncertain diagnosis of cancer that are potentially life threatening and we're going to give them psychedelics. It's like, but they did it. They did it and I think it's a testament to griffiths stature as a researcher that that that was allowable. This was a randomized double blind crossover trial, very carefully designed clinical investigation. People were assigned to the treatment group or the drug group or the non drug group randomly blindly and investigated the effects of the drug also with different doses, which is another hallmark of a well designed pharmacological study, very low placebo like dos one or three milligrams per 70 kilograms of body weight versus a high dose 22 or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms of of psilocybin chemical suicide, but administered in counterbalance sequence with five weeks between sessions in a six month followup.

Speaker 11:         04:02:26       Instruction to participants and staff minimized the effects of expectancy participants, staff, and community observers. Rated participant moods, attitudes and behaviors throughout the study, and it's also the hallmark of a well designed study because they didn't rely on a single source of information for the outcome data, right? They got self-reports, that's fine, but they had relatively objective observers also gather data at the same time, high dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician and self related measures of depressed mood and anxiety along with increases in quality of life, life meaning and optimism and decreases in death, anxiety, and that's an interesting. It's a subtle and scientifically spar statement, but it's a very interesting one. It was the. There's A. There's an intimation of a causal relationship, increases in quality of life, life meaning and decreases in death, anxiety.

Speaker 11:         04:03:25       I mean the intimation there is that one of the ways of decreasing your anxiety about death is to increase the felt meaning in your life and the psilocybin dose just potentiate that, but it's a good thing to know in a general manner if it happens to be a generalizable truth, right? If you're terrified of mortality, terrified of vulnerability, there's always the possibility that the life path that you're following isn't rich enough to buffer you against the negative element of existence. It's a reasonable hypothesis and an optimistic one. I think although a difficult one at six month followup, these changes were sustained with about 80 percent of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Stephen Ross commenting about this, he was a co investigator, said it is simply unprecedented in psychiatry that a single dose of a medicine produces these kinds of dramatic and enduring results, right? Which means we have no idea why this happens.

Speaker 11:         04:04:29       Participants in attributed improvements and attitudes about life slash self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high dose experience with more than 80 percent endorsing moderately or greater, increased wellbeing and life satisfaction. Community observers showed corresponding changes. Mystical type Silas psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of Psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes. What that means is that, well, when researchers were trying to look at a causal relationship between drug ingestion and the positive outcome, the causal relationship was drug ingestion, mystical experience, positive outcome. It wasn't drug ingestion, positive outcome. There had to be the experience produced by the pharmaceutical agent in order for the pharmaceutical agent to have had its effect. Now we don't. Again, we don't know why that is either. Maybe some people needed a higher dose. Who knows because people vary tremendously in their sensitivity to pharmaceutical substances. Now, why am I telling you all this?

Speaker 11:         04:05:30       Well, I'm telling you for a variety of reasons. One is the first is make no mistake about it. Human beings have the capacity for forms of consciousness that are radically unlike our normative forms of consciousness and the evidence that those alternative forms of consciousness are purely pathological, which is the simplest explanation, right? You perturb the system, produces pathology that's negative. That is the simplest explanation. The evidence for that is weak at best, leaving out the bad trip issue, which which is non trivial. The empirical evidence as it accrues in fact seems to suggest that the consequence of mystical, positive mystical associated with psychedelic intake is overwhelmingly positive. Even in extreme situations and you really can't find a more extreme situation than uncertain cancer diagnosis with concomitant time and depression and anxiety. Like. I mean that's not as bad as it gets, but it gets kind of in the ballpark.

Speaker 11:         04:06:34       And so the fact that even under circumstances like that, there was the overwhelming probability that the experience would be positive because that's another thing you wouldn't expect. You know, even from some of the earlier earliest discussions about psychedelic use that were put forth by people, including Timothy leary describing the importance of sat right so that the early experimenters noted that if you had a psychedelic experience and you were in a bad state or in a bad place, that that was one of the precursors to a bad trip. That the negative emotion that you entered the experience with could be magnified tremendously by the, by the chemical substances. So that it was necessary to be somewhere safe to be around people that you trust, to be in a familiar environment, to get all the variables that you could control under control, but here's the situation where that isn't what's happening at all because people have this cancer diagnosis of cancer diagnosis of unspecified outcome, and they still, the vast majority of them had a positive experience and the positive experience experience had long lasting positive consequences.

Speaker 11:         04:07:41       So, so the case that the transcendent experience is not real, that's wrong. It's real. Now we don't know what that means because it actually challenges to some degree our concepts of what constitutes real, but it's certainly well within the realm of normative human experience. So it's part of the human capacity. And you know, there there's been other neurological experiments to. There's, there's a researcher, Canadian researcher, if I remember correctly, who invented something. He called the God helmet and it used electromagnetic stimulation, brain stimulation to induce mystical experiences. Now, I don't remember what part of the brain he was shutting off or activating with that particular gadget, but and you know there's, there's, there's, there's all, there's all sorts of other indications of this sort of thing that have cropped up in other domains of the neurological literature. For example. It's very common for people who are epileptic to have religious experiences as part of the prodromal to the actual seizure.

Speaker 11:         04:08:50       That was the case with Dostoevsky, for example, who had incredibly intense religious experiences that would culminate in epileptic seizure and he said that they were of sufficient quality that he would give up his whole life to have had the. And the funny thing too is that in my reading of Dostoevsky at least is that I think that epileptic seizures and the associated mystical were part of what made him a transcendently brilliant author. I don't think that he would have broken through into the domains of insight that he possessed without those strange neurological experiences. And it was certainly not the case that his epilepsy or the experiences that were associated with it produced. What you might describe as an impairment in his cognitive function is quite the contrary. At least that's how it looks to me.

Speaker 1:          04:09:41       This is a critical issue with regards to the harmonic transformation, is that people go through these terrible, terrible experiences, often drug induced by the way, with regards to the Sharman, they usually use psychedelic chemicals of one form or another, often mushrooms, but what they've come up with some very strange concoctions like Iowasca down in the Amazon and Iowasca has an amazing substance. It's made out of the bark of one thing and another plant whose name I don't remember that hardly even grow in the same place and that has to be cooked together in a special way and no one has any idea how the damn Amazonians figured that out. It looks impossible. And if you ask them, they say, well, the plants told us how to do it, which was western people don't find very helpful, but the shamans are perfectly healthy, happy with that description.

Speaker 1:          04:10:29       And IOWASCA takes them apart. And it does that in part because it affects the serotonergic system very, very powerfully, like all psychedelics do and it transports them to another world and that's how they interpreted and, and, and, and what we know about psychedelics, you could put in a thimble and then throw the thimble away. We know nothing about psychedelics. There's new experiments going on at Johns Hopkins, for example, with silicide button, which is part of this active chemical in magic mushrooms. Same structure basically as LSD and masculine and all the real psychedelics have basically the same structure except the one that's derived from am Anita must scarier, which is called muscular acid. And it's a, it's its own weird thing that no one knows anything about. Anyways, they have profound neurochemical effects in very small doses. And I'm the research group at Johns Hopkins has given Psilocybin to research subjects, you know, purified psilocybin because they started the new experimentation with psychedelics in that's been banned for like 40 years because psychedelics were so terrifying to our culture that we just put them away.

Speaker 1:          04:11:36       And it's like, oh no, we're not going there. And so even from a research perspective, and even though some of the psychedelics look very promising for the treatment of disorders like alcoholism, they recently used silicide going to help people stop smoking down at Johns Hopkins and I think they had an 80 percent success rate, which is just like, that's just absolutely mind boggling and so. But if you give people psilocybin and they have a mystical experience, which is very common among people who take these sorts of chemicals, then their personality transforms permanently such that one year later they're one standard higher in openness and openness is the creativity dimension. And that seems to be a permanent transformation. And so that's really remarkable. And about 80 percent of the people who undergo the Johns Hopkins Experiments report that the experience is like one of the two or three most important things they've ever.

Speaker 1:          04:12:29       That's never ever happened to them. And so. Well that's, that's something, you know, it's like. And then there's this guy named Rick strassman down at, I think he was at the University of Texas and he did experimentation with DMT, dmt, dimethyltryptamine I remember, if I remember correctly, is the active ingredient in Iowasca and you produce it in your brain and it's in plants. It's a very common chemical. But DMT is a weird hallucinogen because it has an extraordinary short mechanism of action. It's like, and people who take it report that they're blasted out of their body, like out of a cannon. And then they go out somewhere and encounter beings of various sorts. And then 10 minutes later they're back and virtually everyone reports that, which is really strange. And, and so straussman was giving people dmt intravenously so that the trip would last longer. He get, this was all, all, you know, nih funded, uh, experimentation all cleared with the relevant ethics boards all conducted within the last 10 years.

Speaker 1:          04:13:32       He basically quit doing it because he was a pretty straight scientists, you know, he was measuring heart rate and pulse and all that sort of thing. Trying to look at the physiology and then the people he was giving these chemicals to kept coming back and telling him these, these crazy stories. And uh, well I just, it was too much for them, you know, and no wonder, you know, because they all said the same thing. And he'd say, well, that was a dream. And they'd say no. And it was the most real thing that ever happened to me. And he'd say, well, you know, it's an archetypal experience. And they'd say, no, no, no, that was no archetipal experience. I went somewhere else and I saw things and I'm back and I don't care what you think and like, who the hell knows, right? Because it's all subjective.

Speaker 1:          04:14:13       But, but the weird thing about it is that everyone's reporting the same thing. How the hell do you account for that? And then the shaman, you know, when they take these psychedelic chemicals, they basically say the same thing. They say, well first of all, it more or less killed me. That's this. No, I dissolved to skeleton. And then I climbed a tree that Unites Heaven and earth and I went into the realm of the gods and they gave me some information and I'm back. It's like, okay, well, you know, we don't really know what to make of that. And we certainly, that's what len describes when he describes the shamanic is traumatic procession, not the shamanic initiation and you know, there's dissolution to a skeleton first and then like a death, the symbolic death or experienced as an actual death and then bang up into the realm of the gods and then they come back.

Speaker 1:          04:15:05       It's a very old idea. And that's a medieval representation. The tunnel that people travel through at the end of their life to, you know, to find the light, which is a very common near death experience report. And people don't have any idea what the hell to do with those reports except say, well, it's the paroxysms of the dying brain, which you'd expect to be a hell of a lot more random in my opinion. And the idea is there's a rebirth after that. And you know, here, this is the Scandinavian representation of that tree that unites Earth with heaven. And so there's the Scandinavian representation. It has a snake snakes down here eating it. And then that's the Amazonian representation. It's like, how the hell do you account for that? We know those pictures are so similar that it's just, it's beyond belief. Well, you know, we lived in trees for a long time, a long, long, long, long time, millions of years, and there were lots of snakes around them.

Speaker 1:          04:16:04       And so the idea that reality is a tree that's surrounded by a snake that's in us, man, it's down there, it's deep. And there's something about it that's true, not true, like we normally think of truth, but truth true in an entirely different manner. So and all that's pretty damn strange. We'll stop with this. My son drew this when he was seven years old. Blew me away, man. I thought it was so cool. So I had it laminated. And so here is what it is on the right hand side, that's the order. It's like the Yin Yang thing that's order left side chaos, right? And those are all mushroom houses, which I thought was amazing. And then there's this river that runs right down the middle, like the line for order and chaos. And then there's this tree that goes up to heaven and that's having up there.

Speaker 1:          04:16:52       It's like their St Peter. There's the pearly gates, there's the cloud. It's like he never went to church, you know, it's like what the hell? And then there's a little bug there that goes up and down from heaven to earth. And that was him. And I thought he had a very organized psyche. That kid. He was very, very stable kid. And still listen who drew that? And I thought, Jesus, that's just bloody well unbelievable. And I still think that when I look at it, and that's a great example of an archetype. And so we'll see you Tuesday.

Speaker 19:         04:17:28       Sure. I'm going to read something wrote in the first part beyond good and evil, which is a section called the prejudices of philosophers. And it's a really good example of the density of this book. One of the ways of conceptualizing beyond good and evil. And I think this is true for most great works of it's true most works is that

Speaker 6:          04:17:58       the

Speaker 19:         04:18:00       author of the work collects unconsciously collect patterns from his or her interaction with the world and then gives them initial formulation

Speaker 19:         04:18:18       and the patterns can be deep and multilevel and the initial formulation translates them into not so much ideas as into the seeds of future ideas and the more poetically arthur happens to be the more the case that his or her ratings contained within it. The seeds of future ideas and where the romantic philosophers are. Authors and I think Nietzsche and Dostoevsky or or in some sense foremost among them are particularly notable. Further ability to do exactly that. Now in this particular paragraph, just particular paragraph not only serves as an example of that, but it also serves as a self conscious reflection on that because Nietzsche is writing a paragraph here that is full of the seeds of ideas that will actually bloom flower to a great degree in the 20th century. But while he's simultaneously revealing these, those ideas, he's also telling you exactly how he's doing it and how it is that philosophers do it.

Speaker 19:         04:19:28       So it source. It's a spectacular accomplishment. I'm going to read it, probably phrase by phrase and then take it apart because it's so dance and beyond good and evil is like that. It's neat. You, when Nisha was writing beyond good and evil, he wasn't very well. And because of that he had to spend a lot of time thinking and not very much time writing. And because he was also brilliant beyond comprehension, his ability to distill what he was thinking into incredibly rich phrases this. And I think at some sense it's beyond parallel. Mean often if I'm reading a book, if it has any utility at all market, usually I fold over the top of the page or sometimes put a yellow sticky note I want to do. If I find a place where there's an idea that's worth returning to, that that's, um, that's particularly worth understanding. And you can't do that with a book like beyond good and evil because what ends up happening is you have to mark every sentence and obviously marketing every sentence isn't any better than not marking any sentences at all. So

Speaker 19:         04:20:47       I guess I also might as well tell you why it is worth bothering with a book like this at all because it's a very difficult book and it's also the sort of book that will rattle you up, so need you is is very interested in the problem of my value and the problem of value is not the problem of what is the world made out or even how does the world function, which are more in some sense more specifically scientific questions, but how is it that you should conduct yourself in the world? How should you act? And people act towards aims in a sense. Because we're active creatures and we're moving from one point to another. We're moving towards things that we want and that means that we're guided by our desires and we're not only guided by desires in so far as we have individual desires were guided by the structure that consists of how those desires are related to one another.

Speaker 19:         04:21:52       So for example, if you have a room full of people, say a room full of children, they're active and they're each pursuing their individual desires, but at some point they may choose to organize themselves into a game and if they organize themselves into a game, what they're doing for all intents and purposes, is producing a little society, little micro society within that micro society. They're deciding what desires will be currently expressed and how they'll exist in relationship to one another, and that means that they can cooperate without too much conflict and that they can jointly moved towards a joint ame without and and, and gather all the benefits that might be associated with that. And that might be the accomplishment of the Ame, whatever it is, but it also might be just the enjoyment that's to be had in the pursuit of that activity. Now people do that socially because we have to do that in order to get along with other people because our desires have to be melded with those of other people, but we also do it psychologically and those two things exist in a dance because as I'm interacting with other people,

Speaker 19:         04:23:14       the demands of the fact that we're interacting make require each of us to arrange our desires in a way that's acceptable to everyone else, but at the same time, while we're doing that, we're also observing the process by which those desires are ordered and then we internalize that process and use that to order our own desires. And so there's a constant mutually informative dance between the individual and the group and the culmination of that is the organization of society and the simultaneous organization of the psyche and it's that process that Nietzsche is talking about in these paragraphs. Now you might ask yourself, well, what's the utility of articulating such things and them and understanding them, and the answer in some ways is straightforward.

Speaker 19:         04:24:11       If you don't want to run a foul of your own desires, you have to organize them. Because some of them are short term and some of them are medium term and some of them are long term and some of the main this and some of the main that, and it isn't necessarily the case that those desires allow for mutual fulfillment. So for example, maybe you're very interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with someone, but you're also very interested in having a family and some stability in your life or maybe you're interested in pursuing a sexual relationship with a whole sequence of people, but you're also interested in having a family of stabilizing your life. It's not obvious that those desires can exist in the same universe without producing what you might think about as a war and some of that might be a psychological war, but some of it's also going to be a war that actually occurs in existence. Well, you're fighting through the contradictory consequences of wanting to pursue many people and formulate a stable relationship with one person.

Speaker 19:         04:25:17       Now, part of the reason that you want to think about these sorts of things is because if you think about them and get your thoughts and your value system intelligently and coherently cogently laid out, then when you act out that value system in the world, you're going to run into less conflict and less uncertainty and less misery and you're going to have a higher probability of getting what it is that you want, but you're also going to have a higher probability of getting what you want in a way that allows you to cooperate with other people without entering into too much conflict with them. And so in some sense the purpose that you think, the reason that you think are the purpose of thinking is so that you can sort out how you're going to move forward in the world without having to directly run headlong into all the obstacles that you might run into.

Speaker 19:         04:26:15       If you were doing such a thing blindly. And so then you might ask yourself, well, why would you bother reading philosophy or the philosophy written by someone who's great? And the answer to that is this. That they can help you think these things through in a manner that you would not be capable of doing on your own. You know, because Nisha, I mean it's, it's difficult to estimate how intelligent Nietzsche it was, but I suspect he was perhaps one in a billion, which would put him far beyond the 99 point nine 99th percentile and there's a massive difference between the ability of people to think as you move farther and farther out into the extremes intelligence and when you have the writings of someone who's one in a billion, then you can interact with those writings in a way that enables you, if you'll put the time into benefit from the spectacular fact of that intelligence. Nisha was a full professor by the time he was 24 at a time when he didn't even have to write a dissertation. They just made him a full professor at a time where that was. That never happened.

Speaker 19:         04:27:37       So this is what he has to say and the prejudice is a philosopher is just the first chapter of the book. Beyond good and evil. It is gradually become clear to me what every Greek philosophy up until now has consisted of namely the confession of its originator and the species of involuntary and unconscious autobiography. Well, that's deceptive. That's a deceptively simple sentence. Even though it's not a particularly simple sentence because it. It stands on its head. What people generally assume about the process of thinking.

Speaker 19:         04:28:20       You generally think that when you're thinking, you're thinking about, as I mentioned before, the structure of the objective world need shoes, is making an entirely different point here and what he's fundamentally doing is treating the philosopher not as a rational being, but as a living being, and there's a big difference between being a rational being and being a living being. Because if you're living being your primary goal is to do whatever it is that furthers your life and if you're a rational being, then your primary goal is to do whatever it is that a rational being might do. And you could say that a living being should first and foremost be a rational being and in some sense that's the message of the of the Western enlightenment. But it's by no means self evident that that's the case and it's certainly not something that Nietzsche, Nietzsche, he doesn't believe that people are rational beings, certainly not primarily, and more importantly, he isn't exactly convinced that they should be so. So for example, one of niches, most famous maximums is that truth serves life and that's a very difficult different idea. Then the purpose of truth say the accurate representation of the objective world. Those aren't the same thing at all. Now you could ask, well, what does it mean for truth to serve life? And if you construe truth that way, what would truth look like? And you know the mere statement, the truths should serve life doesn't offer you the answers to those questions, but

Speaker 19:         04:29:48       but it, it's the beginning of a different metaphysics. And in some sense of metaphysics, which is say the universe within which a philosopher might operate a metaphysics is the initial structure of presuppositions within which a view of the world is organized. One presupposition might be human beings are rational and that we're attempting to formulate and improve our sense of the objective world, our formulation of the objective world, and another would be that you would be. These aren't rational or irrational and that we're. What we're motivated to do is to live whatever that means and that the purpose of our thinking and our philosophy should be to facilitate our living and that's neat use. That's one of the foundation blocks of niches philosophy. So He's a moral philosopher fundamentally because morality is about values and the values essentially values are

Speaker 19:         04:30:52       you could say values are what you aim for, but it's more complicated than that. Values actually constitute the lens through which you view the world. So it's partly what you're aiming at, but it's also partly your conception of who you are now and where you are. And it's also part that your conception of how you're going to get to where it is that you want to be. And it's also partly the psychological system that you use to parse up the world so that it reveals to you the pathway that you could take to get to what you want to value values, all of that, and then it's more than that because you could say that you have added value which contains all of that, but then you can say that you have a set of values which is the arrangement of all about. And then you can say that you have a set of values that's the arrangement of all that, that you have to arrange with other people and then you could say that you have all that and you have to arrange it with other people and you have to arrange it across different spans of time because what you want today and what you want next week and what you want next month are not necessarily the same thing and one does not necessarily lead into the other.

Speaker 19:         04:31:56       So to be a moral philosopher is to examine how that, what that system is and how it operates and how it came about. Now, one of the things that nature says is it has gradually become clear to me what every Greek philosophy up until now is consisted of namely the confession of its originator and the species of involuntary and unconscious autobiography. So his claim fundamentally is that no matter what the philosopher thinks he's doing well, he's reading philosophy. What he's actually doing is revealing and articulating his being, and then you might say, well, where did that be income from? And the answer to that is, well, partly it's you could consider it a biological function in so far as that we have value structures that are built into us that are in the process. We would say the process of a very long evolutionary history, but because you're also a cultural phenomena and because the manner in which you've arranged your values and your desires has been conditioned to the degree by the process of enculturation that you were subjected to when you

Speaker 19:         04:33:05       confessed and an autobiographical manner and articulate that what you're also doing is really capitulating the entire structure of your culture. It's in you and you might say, well, where is it in you? And that, and what does it, you mean, part of it means is that you act out a pattern of behavior and that pattern of behavior is like a dance that someone is manifesting to a symphonic score. It's unbelievably complicated and it has its psychological elements and some of those are conscious and some of them aren't. Some of them are just implicit in bedded in the way you act, in the way you perceive. And what the philosopher is attempting to do is to reveal those to himself and to articulate them so that the entire structure can be analyzed. Well. So niches, first proposition is that when a philosopher is thinking that what he's doing is not thinking, it's revealing himself in an autobiographical sense, under the guise of rational thinking. And so then it becomes something more like a story.

Speaker 6:          04:34:06       Um,

Speaker 19:         04:34:08       well, any governors all about in the first two phrases. So that gives you some example, some indication of what this book is like, a species of involuntary unconscious autobiography. Well, that's a more complicated idea too because you might say, well, why would someone be driven in an involuntary way, in an unconscious way to describe their autobiography,

Speaker 6:          04:34:38       and

Speaker 19:         04:34:39       that's a very complicated question. It might be that one of the reasons that people valued one another is because we

Speaker 19:         04:34:47       engaged in the process of sharing deeply autobiographical information. You tell me your story and I tell you my story, and you might say, well, why? Why do we even bother with such things? And the answer to that as well. If you can tell me about the pain and tragedy that you've encountered, then that gives me a better way of that gives me a better vision of the dangers of the world without actually having to expose myself to those dangerous except in simulation. I might feel sorry for you. I might feel bad about your tragic experiences, but I'm not bleeding for them. And then there's always the possibility that you'll also tell me how you solved your problem. In which case I can either avoid that problem entirely or if I do encounter a consultant without having to go through. Maybe it took you decades to formulate your solution to that problem and you can tell me your story and then I have the information, and so that's part of what human beings are always trading. That's why we talk to each other. That's why we can communicate, and so Nietzsche would say, well, it's. It's involuntary unconscious, involuntary unconscious. He's alluding to the fact that that proclivity is so deeply embedded in people. The desire to make an autobiographical recounting that

Speaker 19:         04:36:02       it serves as a kind of motivation that we don't question for doing almost everything that we do. So you know, I mean, people do such things as a 10 movies and plays and they usually do that happily, especially if the movie or the play is a high quality. And the same thing happens when people are reading novels.

Speaker 19:         04:36:23       They're attracted to such things. They have a built in value and it's very rarely the case that people will ever question why it is that they're doing such things. In fact, you see this quite commonly with students who were first introduced to the study of literature. The introduction of the idea that you should analyze what it is that you're engaged in when you're reading actually comes as unwelcome news to most people who are inclined towards fiction because they don't want to interfere with the process of engagement, you know, automatic unconscious engagement with the material by detaching themselves and having to think about what they're doing. So that's why it's an involuntary unconscious. It's, it's, it's, it's one of the things within which thoughts operates rather than one of the things on which thought operates. Then he says, the moral or immoral purpose in which every philosophy has constituted. Sorry, the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown. Well. That's a hell of a thing to say too, because what niche is alluding to there in some senses that

Speaker 19:         04:37:45       the philosopher Kant help and that would be in some sense also the person who was recounting their autobiography can't help but tell you what they're up to. Even though they might not know, and this is something that you own because you almost carl, you'll know the cyclist psychoanalyst was a great student of nature and you came to believe that we all inhabited stories. The stories were stories we didn't have in the garage with the structures of value within which we live and that those stories essentially had an ethic or a moral and then you you can start thinking about what the ethics and the morals might be and you kind of have some sense of that because there's. There's comedic stories and tragic stories and there's evil characters in good and characters and so forth. Those are architected characters, but part of the point that niches attempting to make here is that the philosopher is in fact aiming at something with his life, with all of his actions. He might not even know what it is, but partly what he's doing in his attempt to philosophize is to articulate that in reveal it to himself and to other people.

Speaker 19:         04:38:54       So then the question becomes, well, what is it that the person is off to you? And I would say in some sense that's the ultimate question and so neat you here in this paragraph, it is also dealing with the, with the ultimate question in life, which might be well to what is your life aimed? And you might say, well it's not entered anything into. I don't know. I don't seem to have any coherent set of beliefs. I don't know what I believe. I don't believe in anything even. But that's not the case because if you didn't believe in anything you couldn't see. You have to believe in something to be able to see because you point your eyes and things and you can organize your vision without having an aim. And so the very act of interacting with the world presupposes an ethic. And then all those micro ethics that you contain within you are organized into some sort of structure either badly or well.

Speaker 19:         04:39:44       And that structure roughly has an aim and you might know it and you might not. But that doesn't mean that this therapist. So, so one other thing that needs he is alluding to is that you believe things whether or not you think you believed them, in fairness, believing them, unknowing, you believed them, aren't even the same thing, and so the people believe all sorts of things that they don't know about and that partly what they're doing when they're doing philosophy is to try and figure out what those things are. When you know, when you can also ask yourself, well where did they come from? Well, they partly came from you, but you, you're an old thing. Your physical form is three and a half billion years old and you're the process of all that. All of the death and struggling that went along the entire course of that three and a half billion years is you carry that with you and then on top of that inside you is the consequence of the entire cultural history of complex life.

Speaker 19:         04:40:40       That's all inside youtube. And then on top of that, some of that's articulated more or less, some it's acted out, dramatized, represented infection and that sort of thing. And then some of it's articulated, but there's way more at the bottom. Then it is fully articulate and so god only knows what you're up to. And then you might say, well, who cares? Well, the problem with that is that you care because first of all, that's the definition of caring and second of all that determines the the way that you'll move through your life and everything that happens to you that's good or evil or good or bad is going to be a consequence of the manifestation of that ethic in the world.

Speaker 19:         04:41:23       So and now, Nina is saying something else too. When he says the moral or immoral purpose in whichever in the moral or immoral purpose in every philosophy as constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant is always growing. He's saying that the philosopher can't help but reveal his age and his writings and then he's saying something else which is that he might be malevolent and you know, modern people are very comfortable with ideas like malevolence because malevolence is an idea that's related to evil and modern people think of themselves as beyond good and evil to some degree. They don't believe in the reality of those concepts. And of course in this book is also questioning our, at least our a priori presuppositions about what do they need the lore, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't believe that they don't exist. That doesn't mean that he doesn't believe that they don't exist. Yes, I guess that's. I guess that's right. You know, this is one of the things I've thought about when I was thinking about when I've thought about how Hitler guide, no, Hitler died. Hitler committed suicide in the bunker underneath Berlin when Europe was in flames.

Speaker 6:          04:42:41       And so one

Speaker 19:         04:42:44       conclusion that a psychoanalytically minded historian could derive from that is that's what he wanted. Right? And then that opens up an entire vast nest of snakes because one of the things that you might ask is, well, how is it that someone would desire that? First of all, could that even be desired? Is that actually something that anyone could even desire? Then you might ask, well why is it that someone would design that? And then the next thing you might ask is if a human being could desire that and hit there was a human being then exactly what does that say about you? And you might say, well, I could never desire such a thing, but following the long, the train of the argument that we've been laying out, just like what makes you think you're a reliable judge of what it is that you're up to. So, okay, so now we've unpack three sentences and we'll continue on with the same paragraph. Indeed to understand how the most abstract metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at. It is always well. And why is to first ask oneself what morality do they or does he aim at? So what the question is, what's the personality?

Speaker 6:          04:44:04       Well,

Speaker 19:         04:44:06       there's an entire narrative snakes underneath that sentence, that sequence of propositions as well, and one of them is, well, what does it mean that people are up to something? What does it mean that the rating itself accordingly, I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy, but that another impulse here as elsewhere has only made use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge as an but whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far are be up here after this inspiring. No, this is partly why this is going to require editing so complicated to go through

Speaker 19:         04:45:08       accordingly. I do not believe that an impulse technologist, the part of philosophy, but then another impulse here is elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge and mistaken knowledge as an instrument. All right, so let's take that apart accordingly. I do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy. So one of the claims, I suppose this would be an enlightenment claim is that people do have a drive to knowledge and that that drive is in fact what underlies the production of such things as philosophy but need to questions that because he's trying to bring us back to consideration of the fact that you can't separate the philosophers mind from the philosophers Ba. He's first and foremost a living creature and that he's up to something and the question is what is it that he's up to? And so you can see the earliest manifestations in a paragraph like this of what later developed into deconstructionist thought and that that was mostly French continental philosophers who pursued that particular line of reasoning and it.

Speaker 19:         04:46:19       It is derived exactly from this kind of statement by nature. So for example, someone like Garrett, I would say it doesn't matter what the content of the text is. What matters is that the text can be used as a tool for power and then whether the person who wrote the text knew it or not, that's what they were doing and they were doing it in a way to privilege themselves above other people and that's really, I would say, the fundamental deconstructionist claim and it's a powerful claimants and utterly corrupt claim, but it's a really powerful claim and it's related directly to the sorts of things that need you was referring to in this paragraph. What is it that the person is truly up to? Now, the problem with the deconstructionist claim, Ms Dot, it's an. It's an open invitation to cynicism to thoughtless citizens. I can just make the presupposition that whatever it is that you're telling me, you're you, you're telling me merely to dominate regardless of what it is that you claim to be doing.

Speaker 19:         04:47:19       Well. The problem with that approach is that it's predicated on the implicit assumption that the only value that people actually have is the value to is the desire to dominate. And of course that's a purely like that could be the case. And I also think that it's even reasonable to posit that to some degree that it is the case, but to take that from a contributing factor and to make that the highest God because that's essentially what the deconstructionists are doing. Those are entirely different things and you have to be aware of people who take a single causal element and elevated to the stature of single comprehensive cause. You know, it's more reasonable to assume that people are complex in their motivations and that many different strands of biological and cultural motivation are in some sense primary. And then what happens is that they come together to weave a tapestry rather than to make the automatic assumption that you can reduce the entire set of human motivations to a single principle like that power.

Speaker 19:         04:48:27       Now you know, I would say niche is also responsible to some degree for the deconstructionists claim, that it's power because one of his most famous other instance was that the fundamental motivating force in life is the will to power. But he wasn't so much because nature is a subtle thinker. He wasn't so much attempting to reduce human motivation to power. He was attempting to redefine what it was that we conceptualized as power, whereas that isn't what the deconstruction certainly get all because fundamentally they're Marxists and they believe that, you know, will they just ensconced themselves within an economic viewpoint where within a philosophical viewpoint where economics is paramount and where all that matters is power construed as socioeconomic domination, fundamental, you know, and that's in turn is embedded in metaphysics. That's even deeper, which is the metaphysics of presumed that people are fundamentally materialist and all of those things are quick. You know, all of those things are highly questionable. So I'm going to skip ahead a little bit with the paragraph when it talks about the motivations of you might consider them people who were working in the middle ranks of bureaucracies, whether they're scientific or otherwise, so they're in some sense acting as columns in a particular machine. And so that's what he's describing here. He says,

Speaker 19:         04:50:14       in the case of scholars, or in the case of really scientific men, it may be there may really be such a thing as an impulse, didn't punch some kind of small independent clockwork, which when well wound up works away industriously to that end without the rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part there in the actual interests of the scholar, therefore are generally and quite another direction. It is the family or moneymaking or in politics. It is in fact almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed and whether the hopefully you don't worker becomes a good fit. Ologist someone who's studied the origin of words, a mushroom specialist for a chemist. He's not characterize becoming this by this. He's not characterized by becoming this or that niches point. They're fundamentally is that even when you do analyze people who in whom

Speaker 19:         04:51:16       the will to knowledge might actually be offered it even though he wouldn't be willing to grant it. The status of highest motivating power that even in those people were that Wilton always does exist. The probability that that is in turn subordinated to some other principle that's higher in the value hierarchy is very, very high and it's hard to tell exactly what that additional principle might be, but he points out such things as well. Maybe they're primarily interested in serving the interests of their family or they're, I'm really interested in making money or maybe they're primarily interested in status and maybe they're interested in status status becomes a because it makes them more sexually attractive and that sort of thing. So, but the,

Speaker 6:          04:51:58       the,

Speaker 19:         04:52:00       the question of what is it that's lurking in the background is always paramount, so

Speaker 6:          04:52:10       not there.

Speaker 19:         04:52:15       Detour in this particular paragraph, whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as inspiring Jenai or his demons will find that they have all practice philosophy at one time or another and then each of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate lord over all of the other impulses. That's another like the beyond good and evil to think of it as a book is a really foolish

Speaker 19:         04:53:01       framework. You don't [inaudible] this is what a book is when people think about a book. No, it's like a material entity say eight inches high and six inches wide and two inches thick and weighs a pound and it's made of paper and it's between two to two covers you and that's a materialist. That's the eight priority sort of axiomatic book niches beyond good and evil isn't a book at all. It's a series of bombs at each sentence is a ball and each sentence blows things up that people don't even know exist. And so one of the things with this sentence, for example, here's how he's conceptualizing being so the first thing he talks about is that the. There are fundamental impulses that you would be. Okay. So that begs the questions. What? What do you mean by impulse and what do you mean by fundamental? And both of those are extraordinarily complicated problems.

Speaker 19:         04:54:01       So an impulse you can take it to the impulses that drive. You can think about it as a biological instinct. He could think about it as an aim or a goal. You can think about it as an act of will. Like there's, there's endless questions that hang off that question, but we could start with the idea that we perhaps can't define it, but we are willing to go with the proposition that people do have the impulses and I think maybe that's manifest to you more. Most particularly when you're attempting to do something voluntarily and something in voluntarily interferes with that. You know, so maybe you're sitting down to to try to get some work done in the work is not of any particular intrinsic interest, but you regarded it as necessary. You know, necessary element in some higher order scheme. And so you're attempting to organize yourself so you will in fact concentrate on that particular relatively mundane activity.

Speaker 19:         04:55:00       But what you find when you sit down to actually engage in that is you can't do it. You have to go do the dishes or you have to clean under the bed or you have to have a sexual fantasy or you or. Or there's some other thing that you could do that's useful. But that you wouldn't normally do that you'll go do instead or that you fall asleep or that you get hungry or like there's an endless number of that's called them impulses that might arise to interfere with your conscious movement forward. Well, exactly what are those things? Well, nature certainly conceptualizes the human being as a place where those things live and he does mean live too because it wouldn't refer to the Ms Dot d dot demons or or gs without introducing the metaphoric conception of something that lives. And so partly what nature reveals in those sentences that he conceptualized as a human being, as the dwelling place of spirits.

Speaker 19:         04:55:59       And some of them are genie. Let's say that's the root word of genius. That's the terribly powerful thing that exists in the terribly small compartment, right, that you have to call forth. And some of them are demons and demons are things that have their own autonomous will and the generally aren't aiming for the good. So then, so those are all things need. She just lays out as implicit parts of the sentence. So we activates all those ideas, whether you know it or not, in your mind, to the degree that you processed the sentence and those things start to take on a life of virtue of their own, those ideas, and so then he adds another dimension of complexity to that by saying, well, you're full of demons in

Speaker 6:          04:56:43       and and, and gds and

Speaker 19:         04:56:48       they're all doing their own thing, whatever that happens to be, but each of them, if left to their own devices, would attempt to remake the entire world in there

Speaker 6:          04:57:01       form.

Speaker 19:         04:57:02       And so I, I, I thought this from a, from a narrative point of view or from a symbolic point of view, in, in, in, in old stories and folktales and fairytales, you often have a

Speaker 6:          04:57:17       cyclops

Speaker 19:         04:57:19       one I giants, and there's a sexual connotation to that which is, which is apropos that the psychoanalysts would, would certainly point out. But the one idea is that this thing is gigantic wants one thing. And so that's another way that Nietzsche is conceptualizing the fundamental

Speaker 19:         04:57:44       structure of the human psyche. It's a dwelling place full of one I giants. And they're constantly. Well, one thing, one way of looking at is they're constantly at war. One of them wants to be the largest one. I giant and dominate everything else. Then one of the things that so Nietzsche thinks that argument further and he says, not only is this always happening in human beings, but then if you look at philosophy, what it is is it's a continual revelation of the attempt of some singular minded psychic monster psychological monster to dominate the entire psychological structure that are for the entire cultural structure and therefore the entire world, and then you can. You can see in that the entire religious structure struggle of mankind to take this vast polytheistic vision of reality and to organize it into some sort of monotheistic, an integrated structure which you could also consider indistinguishable from the civilizing.

Speaker 19:         04:58:50       The impulse that operates in human beings to become civilized. Because on the one hand it might be a terrible thing that one, one monster emerges to attempt to dominate all the others. But then on the other hand, there's no difference between that and organizing something. Because to organize something is to bring it all into a hierarchical structure with some sort of singular value at the forefront, and then the question might be, well, what should that singular value be? And then niche you would that pis at the whole argument back into the first sentences that he wrote at the beginning of the paragraph, which is, well, what is it that the philosophers up to? What is the force that he surfing? What is the unifying impulse? That's another way of looking at it. If there's a unifying impulse and he's not only fallen prey to some internal demon, if there's a unifying impulse to bring all of this together into some sort of functional structure, what exactly might that look like?

Speaker 19:         04:59:51       For every impulse is imperious and as such attempts to philosophize. That's part of that sort of niches, idea of will to power in its nascent form. All of these unconscious entities that inhabit the human psyche are all alive and they're trying to live. They're trying to. They're trying to climb up the dominance hierarchy and dominate because of course, that's partly what life does because let's say from an evolutionary perspective, and this is probably more true for males because they are less effective in their attempts to replicate the distinction between climbing up a dominance hierarchy. Whatever that might happen to be and success is. There may be no distinction at all, and then you might say, well, that just shows that there's nothing but we'll

Speaker 6:          05:00:47       power, but

Speaker 19:         05:00:50       that still doesn't answer. One of the most fundamental questions is that power in relationship to what? Because that's the question.
