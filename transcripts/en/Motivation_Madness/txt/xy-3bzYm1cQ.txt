Speaker 1:          00:05          When you have some goal out here that you're stretching for and reaching for, that takes you out of your comfort zone, you'll find out some talents and abilities you have that you didn't know you had. When the messenger of misery visits you, what are you going to do? One, we'll keep you in the gate.

Speaker 2:          00:24          There are things that you think you'll never need to know that you may only need to know one time in your life, but that could save your life because you have that knowledge unless you

Speaker 1:          00:34          to do something beyond that which you've already mastered, you will never grow. What is it that you looked at at some point in time and you decided that you couldn't do it, that you talk yourself out of it.

Speaker 2:          00:46          You're waiting on your next door neighbor to make it happen for you. It may not happen if you're waiting on your mother or your father. They may be so ancient in their thinking that they don't understand this opportunity that you have and if you're waiting on them and they never get done, but don't beg average people to be phenomenal. You don't beg good people, the people nominal. You just are phenomenal and you want to try phenomenal. What reason can you remember that you can call on the chicken restaurant that can make you get back up? Find that reason if you're not where you are, if you're not where you want to be, if you don't have what you want to have, if you're not where you think you should be at this particular place, it has nothing to do with the system, but it has everything to do with the fact that you're not making the sacrifice. I want you to make that dream become a reality because if you don't, you will be working for somebody else to make their dreams become a reality.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Everybody is against you or don't believe in your normal. Let me tell you something that's a lonely feeling. It's a lonely feeling, particularly people that you're doing it for. Most people take their greatness, take their ideas to the graveyard with them. I said to me, if it was easy, everybody would do it. There are people right now who are working who don't want to work. There are people who hate their jobs, but they keep getting up to do it. The wealthiest place on the planet is the graveyard. The graveyard, we will find inventions that we never, ever were exposed to. Ideas, dreams, and never became reality. Hopes and aspirations that were never acted upon.

Speaker 3:          02:32          Question is, what are you going to do with your time? What drives you? Greatness as a lot of small things done well day after day after day after day

Speaker 1:          02:50          when things don't work out for you. When things happen that you could not anticipate, what are the reasons that you can think of?

Speaker 4:          03:03          I'm only talking to the people that are ready to get to the next level of they life and they're going to boldly walk into the next season of their life. Unapologetically getting rid of all things people in situations that no longer belong in their life. Most of you, most of you, you're so consumed with everything that's going on in the world. This is the reason you haven't figured out your own life yet. Every blog, every website, every tweet, every instagram post, you are so consumed with everything that's going on in the world. You're ignoring your own world. You can never shy and trying to sit on someone else's son. You can never figure out who you are, if you're consumed and everything that everybody else is and what they're doing in the moves that they're making because you're trying to chase someone else's life. You trying to chase someone else's lifestyle and identity all while ignoring your own life and your own path. What is the vision for your life? What are the ideas and the dreams for your life? What are you supposed to be doing? Who are you? What are your gifts and talents? What is your ultimate destiny and your goals

Speaker 4:          04:40          and you should understand this, that it was always going to be your family and your friends. That would be the first ones to try and talk you out of your vision and your big idea. That's why you supposed to live your life focused on your intentions and do your thing. It's you allow your self worth to be based on what other people think of you as the beginning of the end. I believe in me. If you stopped believing in me, I'm not going to believe in myself any less. If you believe that I'm irrelevant, that no one is checking for me and that I don't mean anything to the world because you think or believe that about me, it doesn't mean that I'm going to believe it about myself. See, the day that you start living your life according to everybody else's opinion is the beginning of the hand. Most of you guys don't actually know your self worth. You don't know yourself. Value, believe in yourself. Believe in yourself, independent of the validation of the world. Have opinions and feelings about yourself, independent of the feedback.

Speaker 3:          06:07          I really think,

Speaker 4:          06:10          and if you get rid of the trash in your life, it can be people, businesses and situations you couldn't really like. I really believe that you can reach your full potential. I want you to fly. I want you in your career and your financial blessings to bypass me.

Speaker 5:          07:00          You know, I never want to be that nine to five person that just lives my entire life working a nine to five and just be happy with a modest lifestyle. Um, you know, being secure. A lot of people, that's all they want. They just want a secure lifestyle, you know, own a house, you know, and be able to retire and that makes them happy, you know, and I just believe that we should always be always be pushing, you know, to achieve more. It's become more, you know, and sit at a job. The same job for 30 years is not something I would ever choose to do in the society. You know, we, we are tied to go to college and get a job. That's what we're taught. If you become a doctor or a lawyer, you're successful, you know, but

Speaker 6:          07:43          most of the time you still have a boss still have someone you know Tony what to do and you still have a schedule you have to stick to, you know. So it's not much different than working at Mcdonald's. I mean, it's just you're making more money, but you're still working at Mcdonald's or money, lifestyle freedom that you want when you want to know is the most people don't understand that you've got to work hard at whatever you do, whether you're working for someone else or working for yourself. If you want to put that in, you know you're going to end up being successful, but that's what keeps us going. You know, when you become content over the mentality is what's going to make things happen. You know, is having that mentality and never give up. Keep pushing forward and trying to accomplish your goals and hopefully you have more goals constantly trying to move on to bigger and better things and find a, improve ourselves in every area.

Speaker 6:          08:43          You really have to believe what you're doing is working. You know, it's very important to believe you have to believe to achieve. If you're doing something you're not hundred percent competent, we're doing, you're going to fail. You know, someone who is doing maybe not 100 percent correctly, but they truly believe in their mind that they're doing the best they could possibly do. And they believe what they're doing is the best possible scenario. I think they're going to have a lot more success than someone that is doing it 100 percent right, but aren't positive and what they're doing, you know, the mind is the most powerful tool we have. And in order to be a winner, you have to lose, you know, you know, that's, that's, that's how you learn. You know, one day I made him tell him he better get out there and start busting your ass, you know, going forward and never stopped. Don't miss a day, you know, one day Mrs can't

Speaker 5:          09:28          back.

Speaker 6:          09:29          Always. Always look at the positive. You know, the glass is always half full. If you think positive and you look at the positive, you know you're, you're only going to continue to get better. And it's been positive in every area is the secret. It's the secret to life. If you're negative about anything, you're going to fail. No matter what it is. You're not happy. Do you want to be better? But you want in every aspect, like if you want to better yourself in every way. A lot of people, somebody else, and it just what comes around goes around. The most important thing is to not give a shit what other people think, you know, that's the most important thing to have. That kind of an attitude and mentality is rare. You know, people are always concerned about what other people think, no matter who they are, it really doesn't matter what other people think, you know, it really doesn't matter if you can have that kind of mentality. People don't like to think they like to ask and they don't have enough confidence in their decisions that they make on their own. When they get advice from someone else, that gives them more competence to believe that that's gonna work.

Speaker 5:          10:53          We should always be trying to be better at every aspect in life. I mean, you know, are you a good husband, a good wife? Are you a good son? You know, are you a good, you know, you know, whatever it could be. You know, there's a million things in life that we are, we, I think we should constantly be trying to be better in every area. I kinda liked to just, you know, relax, you know, enjoy life and that's Kinda what I do. Um, and being able to, to not stress and do what I want to do when I want to do it is just a great feeling.

Speaker 7:          11:33          What changes our whole life is action. Why don't we take action, fear or are we going to do to get ourselves to do it? Well, you got to make sure that we push ourselves through. If I'm making a decision, the point in which change happens is a decision. Every change in your life that you want will come from something simple. A decision. People, what does making change decide if I persist, if I continue to try, if I continue to charge forward, I will succeed. I will persist until I succeed. I was not delivered unto this world in defeat. No, just fair your course in my veins. I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd. I am a lion and I refuse to talk, to walk, to sleep with the sheet.

Speaker 2:          12:28          Don't be a follower. Be a student. Take advice but not orders. Take information, but don't let somebody you know order your life not to do what someone else says. Take what someone else says. Processing. Think about it. Ponder. It makes you wonder. It makes you think, then it's valuable. Then when you go take action, make sure that the actions, not what somebody told you, make sure the action is the product of your own.

Speaker 8:          12:55          I'm exactly where I wanted to be because I realized I've got to commit my very being to this thing. I got to read it. I got it, and until you get there, once you get there, I guarantee you the world is yours.

Speaker 3:          13:11          Stay out of the clutches of mediocrity. Invent. Reinvent yourself. Change your toe shape so often that they could never categorize you. Reinvigorate yourself and accept what is be self taught and reinvent your life because you must live. Your life

Speaker 7:          13:39          belongs to you.

Speaker 3:          13:49          Wait, not everybody is putting in place. Happy place this pain.

Speaker 1:          14:27          You can only have two things in life reasons or resolved. Notice reasons don't count. False will always point out reasons on why they are not living their dream on why they're not manifesting their greatness. They will always be able to point those things out, but none of those things count. The only thing that counts the results and results don't lie. Ladies and gentlemen, they tell it all judge a tree by the fruit that it bears, not the ones that it might talk about, not the ones that it might wish for, but the fruit that it actually bears, the people that are committed are busy doing it, but I think that some of us are producing results in our lives that that level of commitment brings that we particularly don't like or find distasteful. You want to take care of yourself. I don't think that as a participant in life, you cannot be committed. You either committed to mediocrity or you're committed to greatness. You're either committed to being productive or your committed to me, nonproductive. You committed to being happy or you're committed to being unhappy. Once I look at how you commit your time one time, do an evaluation on how you spend your time. I can tell you exactly what you're committed to. People that say they have dreams of one, open a business or wanting to do something differently than what they're now doing. They don't like. Their jobs are unhappy, they're unfulfilled. People said they want to improve their income level. Look at how they spend their time. Commitment shows up in your life, in what you do.

Speaker 8:          16:12          You can make the commitment to your life, but you know black, the results that you have and that you're going to do something about it. See that power is available to all of us. People who look at life, I want something different for myself, so most people like to use that language. They don't want to commit themselves because commitment means among many things. No, it's feels is acceptable.

Speaker 8:          16:44          If you decided that you want to joe this, if it becomes it difficult, if it's inconvenient, so what would your life be like if you decided to keep your commitments? One will be like if we decided to keep our commitments, but we decided to do the things and we said that we were going to do, but we wouldn't even speak it unless we were going to do it. Say, I will do anything. I'm going to do it. Seven days, you'll feel strong and powerful. There's nothing as powerful as the human spirit. You can't destroy when you walked the minute you're dancing to the beat of a different drummer. Don't expect people to understand. Don't expect it to make sense to anybody. Why you got to do this? This is a good job. I'm going, I don't understand. You don't have to

Speaker 1:          17:52          look to this day for his life, the very life of light in its brief course lie all the realities and verities of existence, the bliss of growth, the splendor of action, the glory of power for yesterday is but a dream and tomorrow is only a vision, but today, the day well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope look well. Therefore, to this day,

Speaker 9:          18:33          a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step from an old Chinese proverb. Most people have heard it or have come across it at some point in the meetings. Pretty straightforward, right? Advocates having the courage to take that step towards the goal and let's keep making that decision to move forward towards something you want, but it's what happens immediately following that first step that I'm interested in. What happens when the journey's begun and it's you and your goal in all of a sudden you realized how long that road ahead. Really, this is a turning point for a lot of people and those who can succeed or able to take their daunting, intimidating goal or journey and see it for what it really is. Just a bunch of small manageable tasks strung together. You know when you look at why people quit, a lot of the time it's because they were overwhelmed by their goals and ambitions.

Speaker 9:          19:45          Let's say you have this wonderful plan in your head to climb a mountain. You're thinking about that feeling of being on top, looking down with pride. Every time you think about it, your heart starts racing, so you pack your stuff, you make your way down on the base of the mountain, and then you look up different ballgame right now, the entire mountains in front of you and you realized that that's no small feat. That is when people walk away, when they aren't able to see a challenge, is the sum of tiny steps. They see it as a crazy, impossible task. It's like saying you want to be the next Tom Brady or coby Bryan to tall mountain to climb, like trying to hit a target from a mile away, but if you can identify and map out what you need to conquer in order to become a better basketball player, football player, and begin taking those small steps, improving everyday, that makes real. That's what gives schools like the ability to see your objective not as a marathon, but as a series of little 400 meters stretches, stepping stones. You know what your objective is today, tomorrow, the end of the week and the end of the year, and then completing them day by day. These little victories. That's what gives you a dream life. It's what gives you momentum. You feel good about the process,

Speaker 9:          21:12          and by the way, when things blow up in your face, which happens every so often on this little place, we call them

Speaker 3:          21:19          birth,

Speaker 9:          21:20          you'll have that foundation and that sense of accomplishment to stay focused because you're approaches tangible and it's realistic. This applies with everything. Losing a job, a breakup, failing a test. These things are monumental. If you allow them to know, they can turn into that unclimbed bubble mountain or they can roadmap a new path for you, and if you define what you want, you define success and begin stepping towards it one hour, one day at a time, you'll get where you want to be quicker than you thought.

Speaker 3:          21:58          How you can live an easy life, you know, accomplishing goals and be successful in going out in the world and as tough. The only way to live an easy life is to basically give up on all your dreams and aspirations and just sit around doing nothing. Shit. The disease is not worth accomplishing. Therefore, a life that is easy. It's not even worth living. Nothing in this world, it's worth having or doing, unless it means effort, pain, and difficulty. What you listening to me, you listen to be good. You are going to die. All of you, you or your friends, your family, everyone you know, everyone you care about. It's gonna be if you love life, not waste time because time is what life is made of,

Speaker 10:         22:55          so if you respect and appreciate the time that you've been given, why you out there doing what you want to do, where you need to be, telling yourself is an acceptable to be sitting around procrastinating and I no longer wants to be a loser. I no longer wanted to be offered. I know what it is that at one and I'm going to work hard and I'm going to get it.

Speaker 2:          23:13          When you want to succeed, as bad as you want to breathe, then you'll be successful. Suddenly you lost sleep. More success, and I'm here to tell you today, if you're going to be successful, you've got to be willing to give up sleep. You got to be willing to work for three hours of sleep, two hours. If you really want to be successful, some days you will have to stay up three days in a row,

Speaker 11:         23:37          but you don't need to if you don't really want it. How badly are you wanting success rather than actually working towards your dreams? A lot of you are just thinking about it. I have high hopes for everybody watching this. I want you to remember your name.

Speaker 7:          24:00          It is not the things we do in life that we regret on our deathbed. It is the things we do not because I assure you I've done a lot of really stupid things. None of them bother me. All the mistakes and all the dopey things and all the times I was embarrassed. They don't matter. Find your passion and in my experience, no matter what you do at work, what you do in official settings, that passion will be grounded in people grounded in the relationships you have with people and what they think of you when you were talking

Speaker 3:          24:51          in the teeth of these stupefying odds, which is you and I, you know, ordinarily are here, but one thing I can tell you ever single day of my life trying to find somebody else change their life. I waited till 39 to get married because I had to wait that long to find someone. Her happiness was more important and if nothing else, I hope that all of you can find that kind of passion and that kind of love in your life. Thank you.

Speaker 12:         25:44          Most people don't even make a resolution anymore. Why? Because they made him from years and years and years and they know they're not going to follow through. So after a while, who wants to disappoint yourself? Who wants to be upset with yourself? Why even bother to set a new standard for this year? You know it's going to be the same as last year.

Speaker 1:          26:05          Many of us don't act because we want other people's approval. We want everybody to like us and to accept us, and that's not possible. Many of us don't do the things that we want to do and don't act because of lack of self confidence. We don't believe enough in ourselves.

Speaker 12:         26:24          There's no denying that inside of you. They only thing that's gonna make you happy and but you're adding the decades ahead. It's going to be having you have an experience where on a regular basis you feel like your life is making progress, so it's got to be a vision that's compelling, something that you know it's going to be a gift to make sure that it happens.

Speaker 2:          26:45          If you want to do anything worthwhile in life, you've got to be hungry. Josh Todd and working to develop myself. He said, I want you to practice everyday being a disc jockey. I said, but I don't have any job now. He said, it doesn't matter. He said that it's better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have one than to have an opportunity and not be prepared. No excuse that. If you decided that you want to do this, if it becomes hot and do it hot, if it's difficult, so yes,

Speaker 12:         27:16          beginning of the year we have this tradition, but it goes beyond tradition. It's something inside of us that makes us want to make things better and I think part of it is the calendar gives us this idea that we could have a fresh start, that we can start from fresh and have this great victory and it's really. The calendar itself is quite arbitrary. It's wonderful to use it, but if you didn't use it effectively, let's use the Kennel under served you today. Let's just see what does it really take to make this thing happen? Because there's no denying that inside of you. The only thing that's gonna make you happy and but you're adding the decades ahead. It's going to be having you up an experience where on a regular basis you feel like your life is making progress. Just think, what would your life

Speaker 8:          27:56          be like if you decided to keep your commitments? It is important and the area of motivating yourself. It's important to know why you're doing it because that mind will say, why bother? Why go through all this? This is too hard. No, throw in the towel. It's not worth it.

Speaker 12:         28:20          If you make the change in yourself, you're going to be proud this year and no amount of money or accolades from other people can mirror the feeling of being proud of knowing you've taken back control of your life or you've taken a great life to another level because once you do that, you have something you can give other people. Would it be your kids or your friends and your family and ultimately that's why it's about.
