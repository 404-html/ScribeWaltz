Speaker 1:          00:00          I want you to got gathering information from outside yourself. Oh, start gathering it from the answer.

Speaker 2:          00:10          He made a mistake and he paid for his mistake with a lot of pain, a lot of tears, and there came to a point where he knew he should have gotten a divorce, but he was stuck. He was stuck in something called revenge. He said, she's made me so miserable, I'm going to pay him back. He was stuck and he stayed in there longer than he should have because it began to attack him. It began to affect them psychologically. He took that same attitude to other relationships looking for something to go wrong. He was burned so badly. He did not want to risk pain again. He was going in relationships trying to avoid pain. When it became two calls, he would do something to make sure the relationship did not work. He would always try and find something wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:10          The person, because they're not perfect people, so if you look forward, you can find it. He was stuck

Speaker 2:          01:16          in revenge.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Is he difficult? Sure isn't. Anything that's worthy of character building. Sometimes I have to forgive the same people over and over and over again. However, forgiveness is a practice worth cultivating, worth experiencing. When you forgive somebody for something that you perceived that they've done wrong to you, you are releasing that animosity, that energy that ill will, that you're harboring inside and it's a lot more difficult than just merely saying, I'm sorry. I once heard somebody say that, I never met a critic that's doing better than me. I never met a hater that's doing better than me in that. That's the truth. I love my haters. I love my critics. You know, it would be amazing. It'd be amazing if motivation on the Cape and positive places engine. A lot of people say that. A lot of people speak on that. I don't, I don't think that's true and I strongly disagree.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Truth is, I don't think people understood what it was I was doing at Schafer. I wasn't there to conduct when you fucking moron can wave his arms and keep people in tempo. I was there to push people beyond what's expected. I believe that is an absolute necessity. I think you become more motivated when you're able to transform it and it into a positive and sometimes our best motivation. Sometimes I'm my most motivated by my critics, but people who are negative, but people told me, who told me I'm too young for people who told me I can't do what I'm not cut out for it. That drives me. Find out the reasons that will make you stronger. Make you walk by faith and not by sight, and will make you pursue your dream when everybody is against you or don't believe in your number and let me tell you something that's a lonely feeling, lonely feeling, particularly people that you're doing it for or people that stand to benefit the most. Or people who should be the number one members in the encouragement club, but they end up saying you can't do it, and they become members of the discouragement. Oh, it hurts very badly. I know what that's like. Have people that you love close to that look at you with that look and say, why don't you try something else? Why don't you give up? But this is my life. I have got to do this.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Everyone tells you what to do, what's good for you. They don't want you to find you all the answers. They want you to believe that.
