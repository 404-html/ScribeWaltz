Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh, I spend at least a week, a year where I go off to the screen, keep us phd. Theses and new things are going on in the field. You'll believe the prime ingredient of his success was his early fascination with computers. You have to understand when you spend your time thinking intensely about a field and how from a very young age, uh, what's my cases? You know, it's 13 or 14 when I started to get involved. Uh, that's where you can do great things is because your mind has really gotten into it. You, you understand that

Speaker 2:          00:39          one of the ideas that excite you or is it just customers? Customers first, second is last a century a company. If you want to grow, I believe you should find a great opportunity. But today this was now lack opportunity that today if you want to be a Greek company, think about what problem you can solve. It's not the catch the opportunity. It's about solving the social risk problems. If you, because companies like Alibaba where brings so fast, it's very difficult for one opportunity that can make us lost such a organization. Who is the power power by ink to net was millions and millions of smes with 400 million consumers. What kind of problem can solve and uh, I'm excited. Anything you mentioned about cloud computing and talking about a more bio things, anything that's happened in the USA is going to happen in China.

Speaker 3:          01:34          There is an amazing degree to which people's ambitions get beaten out of them in these, in these, in these top universities. If I look at what people thought my senior year in high school, it was sort of like, we're very ambitious. They'd all these ideas what they were going to do. And if you looked at the same people at a sort of college plus five years, sort of nine years later, let's say, it was amazing how much things have been ratcheted down. So I, I do think there's something problematic where all the talented people go to these schools. They're sort of evaluated on the same terms and at the end, uh, at the end, a lot of ambitions are beaten out of them. Know, probably the, the one that I think is even worse for people than Harvard in this respect, uh, might be, uh, might be Caltech where you have these brilliant math, physics people and after four years where you're in the middle of your class, you're convinced that the most you can do with your life has become a blind engineer at Lockheed.

Speaker 3:          02:30          And maybe you can go into mid level management 20 years later. And so that, that is, that sort of is characteristic of a, of what I think has happened and what, what, what I think we need to somehow find a way back to is, is this idea that, um, that there's not just a single track, that there are very different things you can do. You know, the question, you know, what truth do you know that nobody agrees with you on the, the, the sort of career version of this is what, what are you really at that other people aren't that good at or, or something like that. And that's a, and that's somehow gets discouraged by this, by this incredible homogenization. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          03:09          And big ambitions get discouraged. I think that you think every way the EU, then everyone runs true of all of us. I suppose we decide we can make it in certain line and do things a little, you know, move ahead step by step. But the kind of, yeah, there's always the ambition to be a founder that if that seems to be knocked out, the whole, both the institutions and the mindset that permeates the institutions is almost a denial that that ambition is reasonable or even possible.

Speaker 3:          03:34          Well, there's a sense that um, there are all these people who are ahead of you. So there's always this sense, there's so many people who are, uh, who are much better or just as good as you. So who are you to think that you can do anything on anything different? And obviously when everybody starts to think that nobody does anything, and in fact it becomes self fulfilling once again,

Speaker 5:          03:54          you know, for me, so much of the lesson that, that I, I feel like I've learned is I feel like it's really hard to decide to start a company. Right. You know, facebook, I didn't start it to start a company. I started it because I really wanted this thing personally and I believed that it should exist globally. Although I wasn't quite sure that that we would be able to play a role in doing that. It was mostly just through kind of like wanting to build it and having it be this hobby and getting people around me excited that it eventually kind of evolved into and got the momentum to become a company. But I never really understood the psychology of deciding that you want to start a company before you understand what you want to do. And this gets back to the question of why did we, why did we first open it at colleges that had competitors?

Speaker 5:          04:35          I have this big fear I think of getting locked into doing things that aren't actually the most impactful things. I mean to me this is like the trait that entrepreneurs have is they just have this like laser like ability to go find where they can have the most impact. And you know when you take on a new project, especially if you hire people or start a company, you're doing that project. And I mean there, there are ways, there are obviously different ways that it can exit and all that. But, um, I think having the flexibility to explore a lot of different things, which you can do when you're in college, which is one of the amazing things about being in college is you can work on all these hobbies, um, and, and, and code a lot of stuff and try a lot of different things.

Speaker 5:          05:10          It's this amazing flexibility that I think most people take for granted. And once you decide, okay, I'm going to start a company, I'm going to do it with someone else, you immediately now need to convince someone else if you want to change your mind on something. And I think people really undervalue the option value and flexibility. I think explore what you want to do before committing is really like the, the key thing and keep yourself flexible. Um, and no, I think that that's, I mean agree, but I think you can definitely do that within the framework of a company. But I think you have to be wary about starting a company, um, to rigidly because you're, you're going to change what you do. I mean, people talk about pivots all the time as if it's like it doesn't, didn't your thing didn't work. So you pivoted. Facebook pivoted many times. Um, it just, that, you know, we kind of, we were college and then we were not college and then we were just a website and then we were a platform. Right? And you're going to change what you do. There's another word for the kind of pivots you were talking about. Expansions. Hell No. What people usually mean by pivoting. Well, you know, flexibility.

Speaker 6:          06:09          Follow your instincts. Very easy to say. Incredibly difficult to do. A little more context. Everybody, when they're wondering about what they should do after college or after university, you have the weight of expectations on your shoulders. You have college bills that you might have to pay. You have parents who have expectations for you in a particular direction. And whether you like it or not, subconsciously you carry all that stuff with you. And if you want to go in a different direction from what you've been spent the previous 20, 25 years, he realized almost being programmed to go and do. That's a very difficult thing to do. What matters eventually is the quality of the investment decisions made and the acuity with with which those are made. And it's somewhat similar to the analogy that people used to make when newspapers were read more frequently than they are today, which is not to get sucked up into believing your own headlines.

Speaker 6:          07:16          And so I think especially in today's era, and humility also goes along way particularly in which if you don't make decisions correctly, can a hand you out a right royal spanking? Uh, no matter how high your public profile, do you believe that there'll be another steve job in this five to 10 years, uh, know any more than I believe there'll be another Larry Page or mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates. They're each very distinctive personalities. Now, if the question is, is there somebody whose name we don't know today, who 20 years from now will be very well known because of a company that he or she started? Absolutely. Yes I do. I think sequoia is the preeminent venture firm. I don't, um, I think, I think I always feel we're always one step away from going out of business and um, that we can never take anything for granted and that we're only as good as our next investment.

Speaker 6:          08:22          The advice that people should follow their instincts, whether I could say a little bit more about that. I think it helps if you try and enter an environment where you think you can learn a lot, whether that's inside the organization. It doesn't have to have to be a company. It can be, uh, be, uh, some other organization or around people that you particularly admire that you can learn a lot from. And I think that just helps expand horizons. So also gives the individual a sense of what excellence is really like how realistic is it for a company to do b to c and B, two b at the same time? Uh, we, I, I'm sure there examples of companies that have pulled it off. Um, I just think right at the beginning you have to concentrate on doing one thing super well on. Once you've done that, uh, the second thing becomes easier, particularly if you're dealing with, it's one thing to sell precisely the same product to both audiences.

Speaker 6:          09:29          And if you can do that, bless your heart. Uh, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a good thing to do, but I think it's very [inaudible] you've got to tailor the product differently. I think that's a very dangerous thing for a company to do. Uh, right at the start, you know, it's no coincidence apple under Steve Jobs was not prepared to compromise a change and alter its products to please corporations. They would, um, uh, build products and if corporations, and it's wanted to buy them, so be it, but they weren't going to come up with, with special products. So it was an approach that, uh, obviously served them very well. And then as you know, there are plenty of examples of other companies that have over time, uh, succeeded with two different sorts of distribution channels. Plenty of examples of that. But at the beginning, I think simplicity is a virtue

Speaker 2:          10:21          cause I think that's really important, especially for young people to actually do that self assessment and find that passion. Do you have any advice? I think many, many kids and many grownups do figure out, uh, over time what their passions are. And sometimes we let our, I don't think it's that hard. I think what happens though sometimes is that we let our intellectual selves overrule those passions. Uh, and so that's what needs to be guarded against. Uh, kids are very good about knowing what their passions are. I love that because I think I've seen you described this way that you've always maintained that sense of wonder. I think that's what kids have, but we lose it somehow along the way. Everybody, it's a gift. If you can keep your childlike sense of wonder, uh, and it helps with creativity, it helps to have fun. Uh, you know, you laugh more and play more if you keep that childlike sense of wonder.

Speaker 2:          11:16          What we're really focused on is thinking long term, putting the customer at the center of our universe and inventing. Those are the three big ideas I don't think that you can invent on behalf of customers unless you're willing to think long term because a lot of invention doesn't work. If you're going to invent, it means you're going to experiment to have to think long term. So these three ideas, customer centricity, long term thinking, and a passion for invention, those go together. That's how we do it. And by the way, we have a lot of fun doing it that way. Amazing about your successes, that you actually, your timing was good. How does a, an innovator actually identify that historical momentum, that Kitty Hawk moment you breathe, you recognize what was happening with the Internet and you said, you know what, there's actually a room for me to start with books and then move on.

Speaker 2:          12:03          How do you do that? How do you find the time and the momentum, the Zeitgeists, I think everybody has their own passion, their own thing that they're interested in. And then you're very alert to the things that, that are in the sphere of influence of that passion. So your passion has led you to change the world, frankly with Amazon, but yet you've got blue origin, you've got pesos, explorations. Why can't somebody like you just rest on your loral go? Well, I, you know, I love what I do. I also have four kids. I have wife that I love. I have a lot of passions and interests. Um, but I, one of them is the pace of change. Um, I love the fact that I get to work with these smart, big smart teams. Uh, the people I work with are so smart and they all, they're self selected for loving to invent on behalf of customers.

Speaker 2:          13:01          And so, you know, it's not, uh, I do, I love every moment of every day. No, that's why they call it work. There's, you know, there's always, there are things that I, that I don't enjoy, but if I'm really objective about it and I look at it, I'm so lucky to be working alongside all these passionate people and I love it. How do you remain nimble? Because there is somebody in their dorm room who could eat you up for lunch the next day. You know, my belief on this is, first of all, that's completely correct and you can't, uh, it can never show anybody that that can't happen. But I think if you have a customer centric culture that cures a lot of ills because we wake up, if, let's say you're the leader in a particular arena, if you're competitor focused and you're already the leader, then where does your energy come from? Whereas if you're customer focused and you're already the leader, customers are never satisfied. So you always, if you're customer focused, you're always waking up. How can we make that customer say, wow, how can we, you know, our energy, our passion, we want to impress our customers. We want them to say, wow, is that kind of divine discontent comes from observing customers and noticing that, you know, things can,

Speaker 3:          14:26          so what was the sense that people have that it's really hard to come with the answers. All the answers have already been discovered in one way or another. And I think that's not the case. And I, I sort of, um, I sort of divided things up into conventions, which are things everybody knows to be true. The other extreme, there are mysteries, things that nobody can figure out and in between are these things that I call secrets are things that you could figure out. They're hard, but if you really work at it, you could, you could figure something out. And, um, and one one thought that I have is that there are many secrets left to be discovered. I actually think that this is a somewhat nonconventional view because I think the conventional view is that most secrets have been discovered and that there's nothing new to find.

Speaker 3:          15:15          And so, uh, and this is certainly is, it is true, certainly certain domains, but I think most things are not like that. And I think there are a lot of fields where new things can be found. Um, we're often discouraged by sort of a version of globalization. We think they're, you know, 7 billion other people in the world. And there will always be someone who will have already thought of it. And if no one will have thought of it before us, it must be almost impossibly hard. And so it ends up being this sort of self fulfilling thing where we don't even try. And I think, I do think the only people who will discover secrets are people who work at it and who tried doing it. And I, I think that many of these, um, great companies have something like this at the core that's, it's some, some domain of knowledge, some area where people think they can figure out a lot more at, at, at paypal, we were very interested in this and the intersection of money and cryptography.

Speaker 3:          16:10          Could you create a new digital currency on the Internet? And um, and you know, it was a fairly idiosyncratic field were, you know, small number of people working on it. There's a, you know, financial, cryptography community, um, and you could sort of understand the field you'd get to the frontiers and you could, uh, you could, you could explore it quite a bit more. And so, so that, that, so I think the second idea I want to leave you with is there still is a frontier left and the frontiers not infinitely far away. There's certain places where the frontier has been close of geographically it's kind of closed, but there are many places where you can still get to the frontier. And it's actually, uh, there are many directions you can go with a frontier as close and where there's a lot left to be left to be discovered.

Speaker 7:          16:54          You have developed as at least profile as a young man in a hurry. You know, all the rough elbows at, you know, I think it's improved, if, how should I put it? Um, we look at all of the cities and we know that the transportation systems there are just not, they're not serving everybody's needs. I mean, even here in New York with a great mass transit system, there are still two and a half million cars going over those bridges every day. And so we just believe we can help the city do better. I guess most, most successful entrepreneurs are not waiting for it to come to their success and not waiting for progress. Um, we are generally a little bit, um, forward leaning when it comes to trying to make progress happen. For me it's about problem solving and loving to solve problems. And so if you are passionate about solving problems, and in some, sometimes I just like to describe this as like imagine a really great math professor with no problems to solve, right?

Speaker 7:          18:01          The great a great math professors, somebody who, who wants the hardest problems, who wants to solve them and love solving them. That's Kinda how I feel about my work. And so it's not about a man in a hurry. It's more about really interesting problems in the world and how do you lean into them and solve things that people maybe thought weren't even possible to solve. And that's fun. You know, for us, we don't really aspire to be somebody other than ourselves. And part of being ourselves as sort of reimagining the way things could be done. So we like to take the impossible. We like to take the old way of doing things and just completely change it. That's part of who we are. Um, but I mean there are great ceos, great founders, great leaders out there and there's, there's something to learn from all of them.

Speaker 7:          18:49          In fact, there's something to learn from the ones that aren't great too. Like again, you know, everybody sees success, they see failure and we see that personally and we should learn from it. But why not learn from other people's success and failure? There's something to learn from all of them. I mean, it depends how you look at it, but when you have sort of this, this problem solving culture, uh, the core group sort of depends on the problem that's being solved. And so it's very dynamic what that core group is and on what problem. Um, I have 10, 11 direct reports and then depending on what the problems of the day, our can determine how many of those folks are in a particular problem. And by the way, a lot of problems getting solved that I'm not involved in. And so figuring out what, which ones that you go into, how do you prioritize it? Um, how do you get to the future faster? Is is one of the things we spend a lot of times sort of architecting

Speaker 8:          19:42          silicon valley and the sort of the state of Silicon Valley. Do you think it's at a high point of, of invention right now or to plateau or at a low point or,

Speaker 7:          19:52          well, I think they're jumping off. It's funny, it reminds me like I, you know, look, I've been an entrepreneur since the mid, late nineties and I remember in 2001 I was raising money. This is the host raising money in the fall of 2001 for a networking software company. And I remember going to one of the, one of the restaurants in Palo Alto, which used to be bustling and like you'd have to book, like get a reservation like a month ahead of time or something. And it was empty. It was like tumbleweeds. And I remember a vc telling me that all the things that could be invented is 2001, all the things that could be invented in software had been invented and that there was no more innovation left and software and right. So that irrational sort of, there's irrational exuberance and irrational pessimism. Uh, I'm just generally an optimist. I just think there's just problems to be solved everywhere.

Speaker 7:          20:51          And once you solve them, you already see what's, you know, you know, I'd like to say boredom is only the result of a lack of imagination. And you know, the minute you solve one thing, you just sit down for a few minutes and then you come up with like 10 more ideas. So, uh, so I think I'm an optimist. Like there's just so much more to do. Um, I think what's very interesting, and maybe this is because of our global reach and just where we've been is silicon valley I think has been sort of the, the North Star for innovation or, or, or the hub of innovation globally. And I think that is no longer going to be a thing. I think if we go five years out, you're going to start to see hubs of innovation. This is about to be real, at least with a couple major ones. Right? Yeah.

Speaker 8:          21:40          Was going to ask you one more question. Was there a time was up, um, um, you're worth a lot of money now. What's the most expensive thing you've bought? Hmm.

Speaker 7:          21:48          Well, I think what a lot of people don't know is that I've never sold a single uber share. So, um, the most expensive thing I bought, I bought before uber started and it's my home

Speaker 8:          22:00          and it was right around a million bucks. Okay. So I got a mortgage in fact that you still have a mortgage. Yeah. Amazing. Fabulous. Thank you so much, Travis. Okay.

Speaker 9:          22:13          Chung Kong is the Cantonese word for the young. See China's longest river. And it is more than just a name for lean. You got a young team,
