Speaker 1:          00:08          Let me tell you something. A lot of people use their work, their business, their profession, their success. A lot of people use their pursuit of education. They're professional students. You've been in college for 30 years and you just keep taking more and more classes and courses and more and more and more things. Or you work overtime under time, side of the time, around the time. A lot of people are church addicts. Every time it turns open, you're not just a member of the church who don't just come to Bible class. You're in the choir and the usher board and the praise team and the willing to fried chicken committee and the this and the that and the other, and let me tell you something. If you succeed in every area of your life, if you succeed, you got the best help. You're in the best safe, you're the best looking. You have the most formidable personality. You're successful, you're financially secure, you're respected every time you woke up down the street. If you succeed everywhere else and fail to have peace and joy and love in your home, what does it profit you to have all of this stuff allow outside and have no place?

Speaker 2:          01:13          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:14          to lay your head, to rest your mind, to know that this is solid and this won't shake and this won't bring it is very, very important to you. Fucks us. Whenever they sense danger or trouble or become a weary, they always go running into their holes. That is a safe place. That's a secure place. He's grounded there. Whatever's going to come, I'm going to deal with it because I'm in a place of grounding. You understand what I'm saying? Birds of the air have nests. They say, I know there's a lot of things that one of the environment I want to get me, but if I could make it to this nest, I could get in this place where it is difficult to get me if my nes is solid, if it's secure and I had the bill list mess, I had to work on this nes. So all of you who say you don't understand my situation, you don't understand my house, you don't understand what I've been through. You don't understand my circumstances. No, you don't understand that nes must be built from broken branches. If you can build a whole mess from broken branches, you can reel a whole house with broken people,

Speaker 1:          02:26          but it's gotta be built. The problem today is we want prefab houses. It's easier to go get somebody else's husband then it is to develop. See, nobody wants to do the work of building the kid. They want to scream at the child, they want to beat the child, they want to yell at the child, but the child has learned a lot of that behavior from what was a model in front of them and you have to get down all the ground level wherever they are. Even if it's a juvenile detention center, you got to go where they are and start building that child block by block by block. Wild people were talking about you.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Well they're criticizing you while they're saying, where's your garb? I thought you were a Christian. You don't have time to worry about what people think over outside because his family thing is too important to, for me to be yelling back at my neighbors. I'm trying to build something out of these broken pieces that God has given me. Oh, glory to God, where my parents said, what good is it to build a house? If you lose the trial, build the child. The child will outlast the house bill, the child, the child will take care of you when you're all bill the trial. I'm over broken. I know the crazy. I'm only got them new beers. I know the question. Now I know you feel like luck big, big, but when you get to feeling like, man, get down on the floor and start building them because you can have a mess if you can't work with broken branches, broken husbands, broken wives, everything in your house has cracked somewhere, everything crack somewhere. Look around this room right now. Look around this room. Look at how handsome, good looking and attract. These people are in this room. Both they look good, dressed up, got her hair done. Look at the males. Males all shined up pointing that you had math nights. Smeal like a Rhoda did from just wonderful glory to God in that wonderful just to him, everything you'll see it's cracked somewhere

Speaker 1:          04:58          and the only reason you don't know it is because you haven't got close enough to see where the cracks are. These three areas, Bill, that puts you broken down. You got to have economic support. You've got a heavy Kebab and support. I know you all think that once you're a Christian, all you have to do speak in tongues of weight on Jesus. The Jesus bus is going to come get you and take you to be with Jesus, but while you're waiting at the bus, you're going to get hungry.

Speaker 1:          05:31          When I got rid of talk to my wife about life insurance, she said, I don't want to talk about it. Okay, I don't even want to talk about it. I don't want him up discuss it with you, but that's all here. We're going to have to discuss about this. She said, I'm going to leave you. I'll leave it too cause I ain't gonna care. I'm going to be crazy. I said, you're going to be crying and you're going to be hauling and you're going to be screaming, but you will have to go to the bathroom so you will need toilet paper. You won't get thirsty. So he couldn't leave water. She didn't leave. He will get hungry. So you've got to meet food and if we don't have no gas or you're not going to be a bleed, I have never seen anybody so brief, but they didn't go to the bathroom and eat and live and breathe and it's going to bring you back to reality. You need stuff. You need stuff. You can't pray it away. Your need for stuff. You come up, put spiritual solutions over practical mean,

Speaker 2:          06:17          okay.

Speaker 1:          06:20          You cannot fix a physical problem with a spiritual solution. Sisters, more Jesus say they'll make you more wife. I want to go to a text. They're having a discussion and the texts about if you get first timothy five seven if any, provide not for his own house, for his own, and especially for those of his own house. He has denied the faith. He has been not faith. If you don't take care of what yours, you have the faith and is worse been then bill.

Speaker 2:          07:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:12          When you look up the word infidel, you will find that it means unbeliever.

Speaker 2:          07:19          Okay?

Speaker 1:          07:19          But if you dig deeper, you will find it is not just an unbeliever who could have never been exposed to the gospel. If somebody who's been exposed to it and rejected it my best. Thank you. Somebody who's been exposed to it and rejected it is called an infidel. You'll notice in the conflict with isis and terrorists, they refer to us as infidels because the purest form of the word infidel, it's a to have rejected the truth.

Speaker 2:          07:51          Okay?

Speaker 1:          07:52          In the Bible, women call somebody and infidel it is that you had an opportunity and rejected it.

Speaker 2:          08:01          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:02          And the text is talking about taking care of widows. And it says, if the widow has a family, if they don't take care of their own mama and Grandmama opti big Mama, my beer, you are worse than an infidel. Worse than an infidel. If you don't take care of your own, you were Berge take care of the old monkeys. Take care of the all frogs. Take care of the whole, and you will walk this role like you don't know and say, you love Jesus. I'm really sees him. Holy goof friend chicken and make up some chicken noodle soup. Then I would, but I'm a prophet. Test. You're better profit. Clean this house and go home and see about Mama.

Speaker 1:          08:49          The Bible says you all wore spam and bill. Take care of your own house. If you're able to. Some people aren't they? You don't have, you can't do it, but to some degree you do something. You sweep. Watch this, and infidel is somebody who had an opportunity to receive truth and rejected it. An infant of the Bible says you are worse than an infidel if you don't provide for your house. All right. God said you had the opportunity to make that house work, but you starved it. You're worse than an infidel because you were exposed to something that you rejected though you stayed in the house.

Speaker 1:          09:42          Infidel. Somebody say infidel. Ooh, infidelity. Root word. Infidel primary meaning you rejected an opportunity. You know how you would judge it an opportunity because you felt like you were rejected. You know why you felt like you were rejected because she didn't get the signal. How do you break the infidel? Infidelity. When we start having real conversations about expectations and responsibilities mutually and you live up to yours and I live up to my, then there's not abandonment. And if we're not abandoned then we don't have to fake like we love each other, which creates resentment because love is hard to be fate.

Speaker 1:          10:45          So I will stop paying you money to let me go live. I will start investing because I will no longer define myself by dollars to the Potter's house. He was so, so a lot of times we give you stuff to replace us. You don't want to feel in this room. Let me some tea when I fill in his room, I feel in this room than there are a lot of people in this room who have abandoned kids cause he hurts you parents cause they disappointed you spouses because he didn't get the signal. I feel in this room a lot of people who are still there but not there, and so you live in your life like it's golden. Did might be golden, but it's not grounded.

Speaker 2:          12:01          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:03          not grounded can blow away. You can blow away and it's expensive to lose it emotionally. Mentally, it's expensive. Generationally. I'm not saying you can't survive it. I'm not saying you can't make it on here. I ain't got not saying you can't do it. I'm not saying you can't pay your own bills. I'm not saying you can take care of yourself. You can do it, but there will be a deduction. Yes. Once I start showing them miracles, they're going to be drawn to my season of miracles. People are drawn to your season of miracles.

Speaker 1:          12:54          Love your season of miracles. You can make it happen. Love your season of miracles. You did, Jill thing on the football fields. Love you'll season of miracles. People are drawn to your season of miracles when you were in their heyday, when did door and the old people love you. Phase of every car always calls my hearing. You didn't believe you were dumb to you, heard you though you didn't believe you could learn to your heard. Somebody say you couldn't learn. You didn't believe you want to a them to your heard somebody say your unbelief is the result of something you heard about yourself, that you believed about yourself and your life has fulfilled the prophecy you heard about yourself. He'll crazy lakin daddy. You had jess slack, your mammy.

Speaker 1:          14:11          All of these are persists. They may not be cussing, but their curses that were pronounced over you that said you couldn't do this or that or the other and the more you heard it and rehearsed it and even argued about it and said you didn't believe it, every time you face a challenge, tell me the truth. Don't those voices come back up? Every time you hit a low place, those voices come back up again. Every time things go wrong, don't those voices come back? You have never changed your belief and you will never completely heal or hole and to you change the voice inside of your own head.

Speaker 2:          15:21          No body, no body.

Speaker 1:          15:27          Ken Do this, but you new friends can't do it. New Clothes can't do it more. Mommy can't do it. More women can't do it. More sex can't do it. They can camouflage it, but the kid kill it because you are snared by the words of your mouth. You can't get him up. People that tell you your privilege when you think you're ugly, that's why you keep needing some more until you change the words that are in your head. Your opportunities will continue to hemorrhage. Like the woman with the issue of blood. Her issues were killing her 12 years. Her issues were chewing her 12 years. The life's blood was hemorrhaging out of her. It was coming out of the lower extremities, but it was coming from her mouth. Oh No. The judge that it is coming out of her lower extremities, but it is coming from her mouth. Can you prove it? Yes. Okay. What? Heal her. Good luck.

Speaker 3:          17:03          Calm football, Lord. It's treatment came out of her mouth when she's sad. Too Harsh. See, I'm till she met Jesus. Oh, she believed her mom herself was that I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm dying here. And so her mommy died because she was dying. Hold on. Relationships died because she was dying. Her heart was broken because she was bad. She couldn't have relationships. She was dying. She has spent all of her money because she was dying. Hey, told, it's how many but touch the hem of his garment. She didn't say it to anybody. What she said to herself, no, didn't you read it in the original language? What is this? She said to herself, it says, she said repeatedly to herself over and over and over again. Because when you're trying to drive out stinken Benjamin, you don't have to say it. Oh, and all that. I'm a Hilton, everybody. So she says, that's what I'm going to touch, the hem of his garment. I'll be made whole. She took them over to a real family, but touch the hem of his garment. I'll be made in a hole. So to even touch the hem of his garment, I'll be made whole. It's how many, but touch the hem of his garment, I'll be made, but touch the hem of his garment, touch the hem of his Karma. That will be, if I may, but touch, hi. Hello? Hello? Are you all crisis?

Speaker 2:          20:10          Okay.
