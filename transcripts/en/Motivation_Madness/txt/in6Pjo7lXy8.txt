Speaker 1:          00:19          Sitting on the same football field, 1993 and I made a quilt. Okay. There's some people call concert versus I called the confidence. I said that I might be the greatest player that ever woke up out of the University of mine. I did not say that because I thought I was better than everybody else. I see it there simply because I was willing to put into work to now be back here 18 years later, my asking nobody for nothing today I'm not. I'm just sharing my story to tell y'all every time you'd think somebody got a good man and always good as you guys said in man, I sat around the greatest athletes in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:32          There's no other man out there willing to give up what I'm willing to give up. I said that in 1993 when I said I wanted to be degraded as hurricane and the only thing that I got in the middle of all of that, this is the only thing in the father's work, this results, there's no other blue.

So when you put on this all I ever knew, what's the effort we'll get me scene, I won't take efforts will get me noticed to get to the league effort to one day take care of my mom and my key effort, which is which one you and nobody else can give you their efforts with the side. And I'm still granted because the next, let's talk about begin to all keep watching me. If I ain't nobody ain't got convinced me of what I do, I'd do what I do because I do what I do. Focus on heal from some unmanned in creative. Every one of you mean and here I have that opportunity man. But ask yourself the question, personally, I'm a Sam.
