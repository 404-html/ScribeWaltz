Speaker 1:          00:07          Right now is that we have a lot of people who want to build brands who want to become influencers, who want to start companies, but they're not putting in the pieces that actually allowed them to weather the storm. You know, the thing that I'm most proud of is the two biggest businesses I've ever built. I basically started them during very difficult times when I first got involved in my dad's liquor store business. It was the late nineties and just about a year and a half into my journey, I guess two years into my journey. The stock market crashed and all the Internet companies folded and all the people that were making money that I was targeting to sell wine, stopped having money to buy wine and Ip and then right behind that, because most of my business was New York and New Jersey based. Even though we were building an internet company was only about a year later that nine slash 11 happened.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And not only, you know, changed. I mean for anybody that lived in New York, New Jersey area. It was much more compounded for us because we lost loved ones. And I remember I lost 100 employees from one organization in one day, I had to go in the hand by hand and take their emails out because everybody passed away from Cantor Fitzgerald that worked in that office so and that. So I persevered through that because I was practical because I didn't have a lot of overhead. And because I wasn't romantic, I wasn't dreaming. I knew that I had a buy and sell wine and liquor and beer and I had to make sure that my expenses weren't greater than the money I was bringing in. Vaynermedia started in the actions of the economic meltdown of the U. S when I started Vaynermedia, people didn't want to pay $5,000, let alone the 50 or a hundred thousand.

Speaker 1:          01:39          They pay us a month now for our services. And, and when I started vayner media, you know, it's funny, I watch everybody watched my journey now. And you know, there's that cliche thing of like overnight success, right? I'm going to have this TV show come out this June and it's going to change my profile, right? I'm going to sit on the stage with will I am and Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Alba for this apple show that I'm about to do, and everybody's gonna say, where do you come from that happened overnight and you know, and it's even really happened in social. I'm sure a lot of you, for a lot of you, you've only really even have known about me for the last six months or so even though I had been putting out content online for 10 years every single day. And so the thing that I've been really thinking about is practicality, like vayner media.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Even though I had already built a nice size business, it wasn't like I was extracting a lot of money out of wine library. And so when age and I started vayner media seven years ago, we started it out of a company called Buddy media is conference room. For the first two years that I ran vaynermedia. We had no rent. We first worked out of a conference room, a conference room. We then worked out of a coworking space before the whole. We work in coworking space revolution and I bartered my time to help that company in exchange for a very small space. We didn't buy furniture we scrapped and I'd already made it. I was already rich and we scrapped. And so the biggest thing that I want to implore everybody here today to do is to take a step back and think about how fancy are they?

Speaker 1:          03:11          Are you willing to be really, really, really ghetto? Do you really need that chair? Do you really need that piece of technology? Do you really need to fly that class? Like I just think that we're living through an incredibly fancy culture of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship and CEO Status is quite sexy. People are selling a lifestyle that is filled with lots of fun and trips and, and champagne and bikini's and bling, bling and all sorts of horse shit. Right? And, uh, and I just think that that era of this era is going to come to an end somewhere within the next five years. And very honestly, I just don't want a lot of people in this room that dream to build their own businesses to have to go work at a bank or go work at a retail store. And so I would highly recommend something that I think is stunningly not talked about enough, which is if you're building a business, you have to be making money.

Speaker 1:          04:14          And so I know that's like a funny thing to say, but I think it's important. I think the other thing that's important is to shift the context completely the other way, which is what is really winning, right? Like what is the definition of winning? And I think we all have different definitions, right? And I think that one of the things that I also want to say is that I'm getting scared that a lot of people that are following my journey here, me talking about buying the New York jets and I do aspire to buy a $3,000,000,000 sports franchise. I do. It is what I want. It's. You can look at my fifth grade yearbook long before business was cool. It's what I want to do, but I'm awfully scared that it's pressuring the people that follow me into trying to achieve things that they don't necessarily want.

Speaker 1:          04:57          They just think it's the thing you do if you're trying to be a successful businessperson. Let me promise you something. I know tens of thousands of people. I know thousands of people extremely well. I know hundreds of people deeply. Well, there is no correlation between how much money someone makes and their level of happiness. I have friends who make $47,000 a year and are the happiest people I know their work life balances on point. They're part of two soccer teams. They play video games. They watch every show they want. They take two vacations that they scrapped together and they're freaking happiest. Hell and I know tons of people who I grew up within the silicon valley boom who have hundreds of millions of dollars in their bank account and are as miserable and as lonely and as broken as you'll ever see. So I implore all of you to please reverse engineer and figure out who you are and figure out what level of monetizing and stuff you need and what level of creativity needed.

Speaker 1:          05:55          I promise you one thing, one thing that will catch you off guard my should be way more rich. I leave money on the table every day. I've left ungodly amounts of money on the table. I spend tons of times spending sending dms and engaging with people and meeting people randomly and not cashing in. I actually believe the statement I'm about to make. I think that I love the journey and the game of entrepreneurship so much that I have subconsciously sabotaged my financial upside to make sure I can play this a little longer because I fear if the numbers keep getting too big, eventually it will take the fun out of it. When you were lucky enough like I am to actually do something that you love so much, do something that puts pressure against the one thing you care about besides it, which is the time I spend with my family, my family is my whole life and being this and doing this is the only thing that cuts into that I couldn't breathe if I wasn't an entrepreneur.

Speaker 1:          06:57          I didn't breathe when I wasn't an entrepreneur. That's the reason I got d's and f's in school because I just couldn't be me and I'm not capable of that. And so I think being here excites me because I think coming to not la, San Francisco, New York, London is always more fun for me. It always feels a little more practical. It always feels like there's a little bit more chips on the shoulder, which is what I have, but I want to remind everybody just because you didn't grow up with a trust fund, just because you don't live in silicon valley, the market doesn't care if you're good enough, you will win and I hope that you don't.

Speaker 2:          07:36          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          07:41          And if you sit around and ponder, well, if I didn't live here or if my mom wasn't an alcoholic or if I just learned about this earlier, or if I had been following this person earlier, or if I wasn't born a woman or if I wasn't born a minority, if you sit and do that, you are losing. You're not wrong. It's just that business and marketing and all this doesn't care. They're just no emotion in the market like. And that's it. And so I think we need to start having much deeper, much more serious conversations of practicality. You know, it's fun and I love this space the most, but I loved it long before it was sexy. I loved it long before people want to take selfies with me. I loved it long before athletes and celebrities and rappers want it to be entrepreneurs. I loved it long before that, it was my destiny. It was who I was. It was how I was wired. It was the only thing I knew. That's why the four year old me ripped flowers out of yards and sold it.

Speaker 1:          08:47          You don't read about being an entrepreneur at five, six, seven, eight, and nine. I didn't jump on this because it's cool now and it makes me money and I did it because it's all I ever was and I implore you, if you came here to be an entrepreneur, but this talk allows you to realize you're really an artist or you're really a number three in a company because you bring this level of energy and you don't want to be a number one because let me promise you something about being a number one. I'm not an entrepreneur. I'm a firefighter. My entire life is taken care of. Crap. Putting out fires. Twenty four slash seven, three 65. My whole life is this is a problem. Fix this, and guess what? When you're the last line of defense, there's no blaming your boss. There's no blaming the logo.

Speaker 1:          09:36          There's no blaming the government. It's all my fault, all of it, and so it's super sexy, but what's not being talked about is the friends and acquaintances I have who've committed suicide in the entrepreneurial and the last four years because nobody talks about the downside. Everybody thinks they're going to be zucks. Everybody thinks they're gonna. Build snapchat. Go look at the data. The data shows that the far majority of this room will not succeed, not even close to building an actual business, and I don't come here to be somber. I come here to remind you that there's only one thing you can do. The only thing you can do that can trump the moment, mommy and daddy had sex to make you the only thing that can trump that. The only thing that can trump your dna, the only thing that is controllable if you want it, if you want. This is work.

Speaker 2:          10:36          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          10:41          Only tangible and by the way, I don't know if you guys have noticed. I've stopped even funny given the name of the conference I've started. I've started using the word work more than the word hustle just because I want everybody to understand what we're really talking about here. If you've got a big mouth and a lot of you do here, search the Hashtag and a lot of you say ceo, founder, owner. I call that big mouth. If you've got the audacity to do it, and, and so many of you've heard this from me when I audit you and I do because I'm curious. It's how I learn. People talk a big game. I especially loved when somebody hits me up on social, like Gary V, you're gonna buy the jets. I'm going to buy the rams. You know, everybody is buying a sports team and I love and I love to look at what that person does and then I'll dm that person and be like, Yo bro, nobody, nobody.

Speaker 1:          11:36          Unless they were a trust fund baby, ever bought the rams. When they go skiing for a week when they're 24, nobody, you know, nobody you know, nobody you know has become successful outside of it being given to them from their family. Nobody you know has actually created success without working their face off. It doesn't exist. So you can sit and talk about luck and you can sit and talk about this, that, or the other thing. But I promise you, the only controllable thing you have is your work ethic. So going back to the beginning of my talk, you need to deploy serious, serious self awareness and figuring out who you are. I implore you to start matching your work ethic and your actions to your mouth. If you're going to be a billionaire, you need to realize that most people that create billion dollars worth of wealth don't do anything besides work every single day of their twenties and thirties. All of them, every person that works at Vaynermedia has taken more vacations in the last 13 months than I did in my entire twenties and early thirties. My family went on to family vacations my entire childhood. I was married to my wife for five years before we had a family. We took two vacations.

Speaker 1:          13:12          It's the price you have to pay if you want it at the level that I wanted at. And by the way, I advise nobody to want it at that level. I'm being dead serious. This is a very true statement. I think most of you will not believe, but I'm telling you, it's the goddamn truth. If there was a drug that could take some ambition out, I would take it. It is so extreme. It is all in. The reason I started daily Vee was to remind you that I'm out working you, that when you talk and you're trying to figure it out, when you're trying to say, you're going to be like me, I want you to see it. I want you to see every other day, 5:00 AM, I want you to see everyday midnight, all of them every day, always forever.

Speaker 1:          14:00          That's what it takes for what I want. Good news is between what I want and what is achievable and it's considered unbelievably all time. Happy is a big gap, so there's plenty of vacation time. I know tons of people with vacation time. I know tons of people with work life balance. I know tons of people that do tons of fun activities and make seven figures, millions of dollars a year and love it. I'm playing for legacy. I'm playing for all time. I'm looking to impact every generation that comes behind me because I want to show that you can build all time, wealth, all time. Greatness doing it the right way and the old way. That's what I'm up to, so please make sure you understand that and more importantly, make sure you understand yourself so that you can reverse engineered that blueprint and figuring out you fit within that and then deploy it, but I promise you, but I promise you, you will not get there with your big idea. I promise you. Sitting around and saying, Oh, I had that idea for uber before uber did. Nobody gives a shit.

Speaker 1:          15:11          I've got every idea that's going to be successful over the next hundred years. It's all about ai and Vr and ar and augmented and all this. I'll give them to you all. It doesn't matter because most of you won't execute against it. The reason I put out all my best stuff and I'm like, then I don't charge for it, is somewhere along the line I realized that 99 point nine percent of you aren't going to do anything about it. You're going to ponder it. You're gonna get super pumped up when you watch me say it, and then three weeks later you're going to give up because you're not willing to pay the price.
