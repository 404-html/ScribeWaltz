Speaker 1:          00:18          I think one of the biggest problems that we face in our society and our day and age, neurodegeneration, whatever you want to consider it, is we really try to hide the truth from people. We've grown up in this world where everything is fair. Everybody gets a trophy. Nobody's left behind. Nobody is different. Don't get me wrong. I'm all for being equal, treating people equally, but the thing is, as humans, we are different. We see things differently. We feel things differently sometimes. Although we can relate to other people, we are not all the same as human beings. We take losses and I think in today's world where we grow up and it's more normal to not let somebody understand that they took a loss is really negative. It creates room for people to start making excuses, gives a reason for people to start pointing the finger and other directions for not taking responsibility for themselves. At the end of the day, if you're not happy where you are, it's your problem. The circumstances, it could be different compared to other people. Uh, you could have definitely been dealt a shitty hand. Trust me, I understand my life isn't perfect. It's never gonna be perfect, it's never been perfect,

Speaker 1:          01:41          but at the end of the day I had full control over my situation. If you're not happy with where you are, if you're not happy with what you're doing, it's pretty fucking simple. Stopped doing it. We ensure, yeah, it gets scary. It gets challenging and risky and you never know what's gonna happen, but at the end of the day, isn't that why we are alive to experience this opportunity that we're given and not just sit by and watch it go to waste overall your goals, your ambitions and your objectives are yours, but so is the outcome and the process. If you want it to happen, you can make it happen. If you don't, you won't. To stop blaming other people for your fault. Be honest with yourself. Two thousand and 17, if you know me by now, I'm not somebody that's all about like new year new me,

Speaker 2:          03:00          but one of the things that's easily able to look at is just what you've done in a previous year. A lot of situations and a lot of people just kind of look at a new year as an opportunity to say, okay, these are the things I didn't do correctly this year and is now moving into the next year. I'm going to do the things that are going to make me better,

Speaker 2:          03:28          but 2017, man, I'm a big year for all of us. The world. Honestly, so many crazy things happened this year with social media being with everybody nowadays. It was so easy to see all the terrible that went on this year. You know what I mean? Sometimes it's nice to just kind of take a second and remember all the good things that actually happened in the year. I know for myself, I was able to express what I love doing for living in a way that brought me into a new creative field, this videography photography stuff. My passion for my work as a freelance designer helped influence me this year to start stepping out of the comfort zone, I guess with other things handed to that led me to this extremely costly addiction in the video world, which is. It's awesome because I get to document these moments, hopefully years to come. We'll be able to look back on this video recapping 2017 and be like, man, 2017, good year, good year, you know, all the way from just traveling more this year, living a little bit, experiencing life to proposing to Meghan. Thank God she said yes by the way, down to all the people that I got to meet this year and hopefully influence to chase after the things that they want to do as well.

Speaker 3:          04:52          No,

Speaker 2:          05:06          a lot of you guys that I've met this year are amazing people. You truly are the positivity, the interaction that you guys bring your way to special and creative to to not push forward in 2018. Please push forward in 2018. You guys are amazing and this also goes to all the people that I haven't met yet. There's tons of people out there with the creative imagination and an a desire to do something that they want to do and they hold themselves back from doing it or they wait till the next year to try to do it. Just do it now, guys. I want to take the opportunity to remind the people and some of the positive things that the youtube creators have done this year. Oh, the fundraising that's gone on during the drought for example, or people losing loved ones, taking the opportunity to use their fan base to actually give back. How amazing is that that we're in a world now where people have the opportunity to create their own content, benefit from it, and then also give back to the world from it. That's mindblowing.

Speaker 2:          06:05          We've definitely lost some amazing people this year, some amazing musicians, at least on my end, to musicians that really inspired me throughout the years to just be the person that I am today, but even with losing them a gave us opportunity to remember a lot of the music. Remember a lot of those old feelings that drove us to create the path that we created today. If you look back at every single year as a marketing point of what's happened in your life, it's going to have ups and downs. Guys, for some of you, 2017 wasn't a great year. If bad things happen, maybe you lost a loved one and I'm truly, truly sorry.

Speaker 2:          06:45          If you could find any part of you to just look at the good things that did happen this year and just focus on those things. Even if it's the littlest stuff to just help push forward. I promise you things will turn around. Looking back throughout multiple years have been at many low points to I've. I've lost people. I've had bad times. I've been through depression and stress and just felt so alone. I can honestly say I've made the best of 2017. It's had ups and downs, but during those downtimes are focused on a lot of the positive that I have focused on a lot of the hard work that I could put in and I did it here. In a few weeks. I'm going to be creating a short film of kind of like an anniversary of me quitting my job to be a freelance designer. I look forward to doing this video because I did one last year and it's just going to be insane. Seen that transition of how I created content. Then to now, if I actually remember correctly, my first ever short film was the I quit my job to be a freelance designer. It's really cold out here. It's so cold out here. You guys are better appreciate this video in some way, shape or form because of freezing my ass off to be out here and get this, but it's so worth it because this is where a lot of this type of stuff started for me. This documenting this, getting out and doing stuff

Speaker 2:          08:11          in two days it's 2018 and I'm going to head into 2018. Not Remembering how great of a year 2017 was for me. Not remembering the bad things that happened in 2017, but just realizing that no matter what year it is,

Speaker 2:          08:31          as long as I'm still here, I had the opportunity to live and I want to take advantage of that to the best of my ability. I want to thank everybody who's been a part of this year all the way down to the coworkers, that creative grenade, all the customers that we've had this year, all the supporters and the videos and the live streams, Meghan, family friends, anybody that's just been a positive influence in this year and that's been a negative influence as well. Thank you for pissing me off so much so that way I gave the opportunity to prove you guys take every opportunity you guys get to make something of it because we never know what year is going to be. Our last

Speaker 3:          09:15          is 2018.
