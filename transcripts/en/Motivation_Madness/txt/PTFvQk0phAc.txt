Speaker 1:          00:00          So I'm not here to tell you, don't do this, do that, don't do that, do this. I'm here to change the way you think and if I can change the way you think, I can't help but change what you do, can I? So I'm going to take your brains out of your head, squish them up and stuff and back in again and change your world. That's my goal today. Let me introduce you to the concept of success. Ben Franklin was a pretty smart guy and I want to start with a quote by him. If you do tomorrow, what you did today, you won't get tomorrow. What you got today? Want to know what that means? The average American makes between three and five percent more each year. That's the deal. And in today's economy, I'm not sure we're going to make the three to four to five percent. Next year is employed, so it takes you 20 years ago, double your income in America as an average. That's the mediocrity that was stuck in and then give me uncanny ability to double their income in the year. I got promoted five times in a year. The ones that beat the system once the contract, your last name of having a difference between them and the ones that don't do that is that they wake up in the morning and they think differently.

Speaker 2:          01:18          We're going to look at every aspect of our lives. We go see what we doing, right? What was your role? We're going to analyze this thing and when we come out of the lab, maybe we're going to be bigger boned up, be better. Are you hearing what I'm saying? And so if you wanted to have it up and make it happen, if we wanted to have it rise and ride, if you wanted to happen, you want to do what I do and that's to get up at 3:00 in the morning if be wanted to have it, that means you don't have to get home at 2:15 and get your butt up in troy six.

Speaker 3:          02:04          I was lucky. I found what I love to do. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner. Again, less. I convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill in large part of your life and you only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great. Only way to do great if you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle her. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it in like any great relationship, it just gets better and better. As the years went along.
