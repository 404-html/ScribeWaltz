Speaker 1:          00:07          The first thing I'll say is I challenged that there might be a founder here in the audience that's going to do something big. Um, it's like the birthday paradox, right? Like there's absolutely the chance that someone in this room here today will be the CEO, cto, founder of like one of the world's most changing companies in the next 10 years. He live in a really special place where people get to work on ideas where failure is tolerated. If you travel overseas to other places, there's a reason why silicon valley is so different and it's because failure is tolerated. I realized that I loved doing lots of different stuff. It's not that I loved technology, it was that I loved doing lots of different stuff. So I went to boarding school and I was the guy hanging a, uh, an antenna outside of my dorm room window to do a pirate radio station.

Speaker 1:          00:54          I was designing flyers for dances. I was deejaying, like I just love doing a lot of different things. And when I read the required reading in school, our junior year was this book called the new new thing, kind of the Netscape Saga, right? Um, I read that and I said to myself like, this feels like an area of the world I can come to and be myself and do lots of different things and see what sticks, a little schizophrenic and how I treat different ideas and go from thing to thing. But that's kind of the ethos of an entrepreneur to teach myself ruby on rails. And I was like, this is going to be a really awesome skill. So I learned that, learned about databases and learned enough to be dangerous. And this is one of the lessons in entrepreneurship is that like, you don't have to be the best, but you have to be dangerous.

Speaker 1:          01:38          You have to learn just enough to be dangerous to build an idea, concept it and show it to the world. And then it turns out there are lots of other people including all 170 employees that work at instagram who are much better at doing all that stuff than I am. But you'd need to find people who can be drawn to the idea that you build and then they ended up taking it and make an even better. I think everyone's experience is different. Everyone in this room has to take the idea that there is a perfect next move and throw it out the window. There's no perfect. Next move. I had the privilege of going to a Marine base once and talking to marines about how they plan their next move. There's this phrase called bias towards action. The idea that you can spend all of your time thinking about what the perfect next move is trying to plan.

Speaker 1:          02:25          Am I going to work at Google? Am I going to work at Microsoft? Like which one Mckinsey or Bain, like the next perfect move and spending a tremendous amount of time trying to figure that out. The marine say you can spend all the time you want, but by the time you figured it out, you're dead. So like sometimes you need to make a tradeoff of what is the action I can take with the appropriate amount of information and risk to move because moving and progress is what gets us to the next step by moving and learning. It all adds up. That summation of your experience over the last 10 years is what makes you into the thing tomorrow that will be successful. All the other jobs that I had offered, there were like two or three, a couple at a startup, one at Microsoft and Google.

Speaker 1:          03:08          I took the lowest salary of anyone, any of the offers that I had because I wanted to work in a specific job at google. I didn't care what job it was actually. I just cared that it was at Google and I would surround myself by amazing people. That was the first lesson that I learned is like go to where the people are short term longterm tradeoffs. Just go to where the people are. Being at Google and going to Corp Dev was an interesting move because I was like, I want to be nurse startups again. I learned a lot about startups in school, but I want to be back in the startup world and then 2008 happened and I'm not sure how many people remember 2008 in this room. The economy kind of went to crap. I remember looking at my boss and being like, okay, so like, can we buy this company is like, nope, can we buy this company note one of them, and I won't even name the name, but it was a really interesting company.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Ended up doing really well. I wish we had purchased it, but the thing is he was like, we're actually not going to do many deals now. You should probably just go golfing and for like a 20 something year old thinking to themselves like I want to make a difference in the world and your boss is telling you to go golfing. Like maybe I should just leave. So I did and I actually, there's a chapter in between Google and Bourbon that not many people know about, but I ended up joining a startup of some ex Google folks called nextstop. Hugely transformational for me because it's where I cut my teeth, learning to program, learning to build a site and everything I learned in that year at next stop before starting bourbon was actually like, it made me ready to go do bourbon. So again, every move you think needs to be perfect. It turns out just like surround yourself by great people where you can learn the most and great things will happen. But I didn't go golfing and that's rule number two.

Speaker 2:          04:43          I never know I will be able to survive for 20 years. So I call myself like a blind man. Riding on the back of a blind tiger for 20 years. Survived to today, Stu surviving that. We want to make this company lost 102 years. So we finished only 16 years. There are 86 years ago. You started in 1999 because in China everybody wanted to be make company for last 100 years that this become a slogan. Nobody take it too seriously. So if you want, if you want to give, you know, the KPI to your people should be very specific and people know it's a serious 100, two years that we were born in 1999. Alibaba, so will last a century. We had a one year and this central one to have a winder years, next century, one year, 100, two crossroads centers. So very specific. So we're in our company.

Speaker 2:          05:36          We never talked to your succeed, successful or not because we think they're 86 years, next 86 years. There are many chance that failed. So that's why we say don't talk about your successful. Eighty six years later we'll talk about it and this is something we know how to make this thing happen. So I think generally I'm a positive, but nectar two or three years maybe have problems. People say, well anticorruption this, but think about anticorruption and rule by law is laying a great foundation for the market. Common economy. You don't want to go to business by bribery. You don't want to have an unfair environment. The market Kami is by rule by law and market economy is very clear, transparent and fair and I think this year does here bad, but this is why we need entrepreneurship. This is why we need the business to drive the economy. So I'm the positive and people when people worry, I'm happy when people too happy. I started worrying because. And I don't worry about the things the president is worried about, worry about the things that nobody worry about and this is the opportunity. So I'm positive because I'm not, I'm not positive, but I'm not stupid. I know you have a problems, but you have to solve the problems. They by little and um, that's it.

Speaker 3:          07:01          Play one game a little bit with me for just a minute. I'd like for the moment to have you have you pretend I've made you a great offer and I've told you that you could pick any one of your classmates and you now know each other probably pretty well after being here for awhile. You can take 24 hours. If they got all burned, you can pick any one of your classmates and you got 10 percent of their earnings for the rest of their lives. I asked you what goes through your mind in determining which one of those you would pick. You can't pick the one with the richest father. That doesn't count. I mean, you've got to, got to do this on merit, but you probably wouldn't pick the person that gets the highest grades in the class. I mean, there's nothing wrong with getting the highest grades in the class, but that, that isn't going to be the quality that, that sets apart a big winner from the rest of the pack.

Speaker 3:          07:53          Uh, think about who you would pick and why. And I think you'll find when you get through, you'll pick some individual. You've all got the ability, you wouldn't be here otherwise. You've got the energy. I mean, you've got, you know, the, the initiative is here, the intelligence is here, but some of you are going to be bigger winners than others. And it gets down to a bunch of qualities that, uh, interestingly enough, our self made. I mean, it's not how tall you are is not where he can kick a football, 60 yards. It's not whether you could run the hundred yard dash 10 seconds, whether the best looking person in the room. It's a whole bunch of qualities that really come out of Ben Franklin or the boy scout coater, so whatever it may be, I mean it's, it's, it's integrity is honesty, it's generosity, it's being willing to do more than your share.

Speaker 3:          08:41          It's, it's just all those qualities that are self selected and then if you look on the other side of the ledger, because there's always a catch to these free gifts and Jeannie jokes. So you'll also have to, and this is the fun part, you also have to sell short one of the your classmates and pay 10 percent of what they do. So who do you think is going to do the worst in the class? This is way more fun and think about it again and again it isn't. It isn't the person with the lowest grades or anything. Anything of the sort. It's the person who just doesn't shape up in the character department. We look for three things when we hire people, we look for intelligence, we look for in, for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity and if they don't have the ladder, the first tool will kill you because if you're going to get somebody without integrity, you want them lazy and dumb.

Speaker 3:          09:32          You don't want them to. You don't want a smart and energetic. So, uh, is that third quality. But everything about that quality is your choice. You know, you, you can't change the way you were wired much, but you can change a lot of what you do with that wiring. When you write down the qualities of that person that you'd like to buy to 10 percent of. Look at that list and ask yourself, is there anything on that list? I couldn't do the answers. There aren't. There won't be. And when you look at the person, you're so short and you look at those qualities that you don't like, if you see any of those in yourself, you or whatever it may be, selfishness, you can get rid of that. I mean, that is not ordained. And uh, if you follow that, you and Ben Franklin did this and my old boss Ben Graham did this at early ages and their young teens, they just been granted looked around and he said, who do I admire, you know? And he wanted to be admired himself. And he said, you know, why do I buy these other people? And he said, if I admire them for these reasons, maybe other people would hire me if I behave in a similar matter. And he had, he decided what kind of a person he wanted to be. And if you follow that at the end, you'll be the person you want to buy 10 percent of. I mean, that's the goal at the end. And it's, it's something that's achievable by, by everybody in this room.

Speaker 4:          10:48          Learning to tell a story is critically important because that's how the money works. The money flows as a function of the stories. And what are the critical things I would encourage you to learn that's way more important, important in my world and anything else is how to ask a question because you want to have the person comfortably telling you what he thinks is important so that you get for a long time. We don't understand the product or the market well. We're listening so we have learned to string questions in a way that provides the entrepreneur with a way to explain what he wants to do, how long it's going to take, who the competition is, how much money he needs, without feeling threatening for many of the investments we've made. We didn't understand the answers, but we constantly work on developing the questions.
