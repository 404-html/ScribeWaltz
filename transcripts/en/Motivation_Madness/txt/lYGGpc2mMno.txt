Speaker 1:          00:08          So 25 years. Oh, don't worry. Animistic is a income is a wonderful revenue for you. So I told myself and told him, my young people before 20 years old, be a good student when into entrepreneurialism. Learn some experience before 30 years old. Follow somebody, go to a small company. Normally in a big company, it is good to learn processing. You are a part of a big machine, but when you go to small company, you learn the passion. You learn the dreams, you learn how to do lots of things as when one time, so before 30 years old, it's not which company you go, it's which boss you follow. It's very important. A good boss teach you differently and before from 30 to 40 years old, you have to think very clearly where you're working for yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:08          If you really want to be an entrepreneur, when you're 40 to 50 years old, you have to do all the things that you are good at. Don't try to drop into the new area. It's too late. You may be successful, but the rate of dying is too big. So 40 to 50 think about how can focus on things that you are good at, but when you are 50 to 60 years old, work for the young people because young people can do better than you. So rely on them. Invest on them, making sure they're good. So when you are over 60 or so, spend time for yourself on the beach side. Shine, right? It's too late for you to change novelty. But I, this is my, my advice to the young people, 25 years old. Make enough mistakes. Don't worry, you fall. You stand up, your fault, your stem. Enjoy it. I mean, 25 years old. I enjoy the show in your show.

Speaker 2:          02:11          I didn't. I have a rich father, tried to three times for university, all filled. I apply for Harvard for 10 times. All failed. They don't even want to see me for the last time I went to the teacher's college, which was considered the third or fourth class of my city.

Speaker 2:          02:33          So applied jobs 30 times rejected. It was so difficult at that time. I was so frustrated because I taught in a university, my pay was $10 a mouth because I cannot find a good job in 1994 discuss it. I'm going to do something called Internet and 23 of them against it. They said, this is stupid idea. We have never heard about internet or you know nothing about computer and I never thought I was smart. Nobody believed that I could be successful because everybody would say, well this guy think differently. Think of crazy that you know these things about something that will work. I try to follow three salary who has daughters from the banks took me three mouse, but I still cannot get him. We talked to over 30 or 40 of venture capitalists. Everybody's mill. Forget it. Not a pupil said Ali Baba is a terrible model.

Speaker 2:          03:29          As I said, I believe that. I think this thing, could it be big? I never thought it will be bad big. Like today I believe something, something is waiting for me there and I have to work hard to prove myself. That was the tough experience. So we gather 50,000 us daughters from 18 founders were started for the first three years. We do not have the evil $1 revenue from our business. What's not easy? Why? It keeps on going ahead going forward, because I received lots of email of thanks from the customer. This a, this is such a great thing we cannot have pay you, but this thing helped us. If you keep on helping us one day you will be successful and I believe this little by little we build up our business little by little we build up our ecosystem of the infrastructure and now after 16 years, whoever Ali Baba Group, we have a team or group, we have a top all group where for Ali pay and people fed. You are so smart. How could you make a company like that?

Speaker 2:          04:41          Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, the Jack Welch, very page mark Sangaber. The difference between those people and other people, they are always optimistic for the future. They never complained. They always tried to solve the problems of the others where you're optimistic. It's always opportunity. People same here today. Jeff, where's the opportunity? I don't have a job. I don't have this. I don't have a debt. We are at the best of time of the sanctuary. The best, uh, sets you have is that you are young. Don't complain. Let the other people complain. The opportunity lie always lies where people complain. Singing about how you can make things different. Is there anything I can do that make the two first and then when you think about this study to it, I saw a lot of people, young people have a fantastic ideas every evening, but in the morning they go to the office thing.

Speaker 2:          05:42          Again, being an entrepreneur, you have to do the things before the other people do. You have to wake up before the other people wake up. You have to be more brave than the others. Use instinct. Everything you do is to the need of the customer, to everybody, to any person. Tomorrow is a new, make the move. Make the action whether investors believe it this or not, whether your friends believe it or not, what their parents believe it or not, that's not important. You believe it. Your team believe in and work day and night on this. That's all the things happens. Make enough mistakes. You fall your stand up. Any mistake is that encompasses. Okay, wonderful revenue. Don't worry about it. Money. Money follows the people. People should follow the creams. If you have a dream just to go ahead. I think nobody can conquer the world. We're only kissed, serve the world, either work for the others. I'll work for yourself and I troost away or can my, for myself working for myself. That means working for the society. If you really want to work for yourself, think about the others because only when the other people successful, when the other people are happy, you will be successful, you will be happy.

Speaker 1:          07:13          I think today people worry a lot about the world, about the economy, China economy in the world and I'm a very optimistic when people start to worry that that is the opportunity is, but I worry about the blood testing and she created the good things and I think great innovations, great companies always happening in the tough times. The lives, like the music, you have a copy of it down, you have a lawyer, the shot nodes, and I like your American movie life. Life is like a box of chocolate. You never know what you're going to get. Right? So I'm pretty optimistic. The opportunity in the future for equality is huge because in the, in in the last century, the t is for big companies. The globalization is for big companies. But now with the technology, we can serve those 80% of the companies that never been served.

Speaker 1:          08:07          We can serve the 80% of the young people that have never been served. Technology for Internet is so cheap, so easy to use. One of the reasons why we grow each China ecommerce so fast, much faster than the u s it because our infrastructure of commerce in China was too bad. Where does too bad? Something happened to ghost. Today we are working on the rural areas of China. I can never imagine that Chinar about 800 million people still live in the rural areas. Uh, farmers and there are about close to 200 million people. They are income is less than $1 per day and before the Internet it's impossible for these guys to reach the pc because it's so difficult. Even people like me, I don't know how to use a pc, but now all 80% of the farmers, those people using mobile phones, we have the mobile phones, the Internet, the data, things changing a lot. So I'm excited about the future. People always worry. That's the, you know, I love the young kids sitting there and talking about the dream, the hopes because if they have the hope, we have the hope. That's what I believe.

Speaker 3:          09:17          And let's just take what you do. And I

Speaker 4:          09:24          loved every description I've ever heard about how you serve people and your story about the bamboo farmers and your wife and her friends. It was fabulous. But where's this going? What are you going to do? What are your plans to maximize the use that people in remote rural areas of China can make of their cell phones? Besides ordering your projects, how do you going to get it? Are you going to get them in the banking system through cell phones?

Speaker 3:          09:56          How

Speaker 1:          09:57          well, um, we, we never know that we couldn't grow so fast that passed the five miles. We covered 4,500 villages and these people normally the, the using very traditional way. Did it take them like two, we went to a rural area, it took them the farmers two hours to work to the downtown, uh, in, in the middle of the town and buy things. But today because the mobile phone and we deliver, we can deliver things to their home, to their village within 72 hours. I remember there is a, well last week I read a very interested in new for this is amazing. There is a girl, she told them your story. She said her grandfather 92 years. So the birthday and for his life he always wanted to try one western style food, but he lived in the rural areas. There's a no such a restaurant food.

Speaker 1:          10:56          So she said, I tried on the Internet book a restaurant, dinner for western food, deliver to that village and the fatherly immediately find the one restaurant. There were three guys, they took like a three days bus from the, from Sha height to that village, made a telic spaghetti and a beef for that for 92 years old bursting and whole village was excited. Everybody starts says, wow, you can order food rest in a restaurant, rest of style of food. So by almost everything, and also we'll helping there. A lot of farmers, they planned a love apples, green apples, but 90% of the apples routed because there's nobody by that they normally buy by track. You know, if you sell via the APP apples, this our whole track

Speaker 3:          11:50          and

Speaker 1:          11:51          using the traditional way they can, they can sell by whole basket of the apples. But now because of the Internet, the cell by one by one, each app with the cell, $1 Oh you know, won't imb or two, I'm just for each. So the farmers will see using Internet, they can buy and the sell and using a mobile phone that changed their lives. And I think it's exciting and people need examples when they see where the other my neighbor made made money sort of online to selling things. My neighbor made by much interesting things are life. People start to learn and more more people started by the mobile phones. We cannot have, we cannot make all the factory, the mobile factories to cell phones to them only they know the mobile phone really works helping change their lives. They started by the mobile phones.

Speaker 4:          12:43          Just one more question. Do you think this will make the current problems like the current problem in China? Less likely. That is if we'll have more market information in the market will drive where the investment goes instead of the government trying to make judgments about it. I better build another housing development or office development here, there and Yonder and you wound up with a bubble. What he comes from the bottom up. Is it more likely that fewer bad things will happen?

Speaker 1:          13:14          Yeah, no. I think the last week I was in Seattle discussing about the China economy. I think the you American people worry too much about the China economy.

Speaker 1:          13:27          Well, you see every time where you start to worry about the China, China goes better. Every channel you think China's problem, you know we've got, you know, we'll get better but we ain't got to say gi. We have a, you have a high expectation of China. China always a problem like a parents of the expectation of the kids, you know have the same. But there's a big difference between the American consumption because people say wow, you know the economy's bad. So China consumption will be good. Look no totally different. You American love to spin a tomorrow's money and the other people's money, maybe all maybe the coolest money. We Chinese love to safe money. We are probably the largest or country, the d safe deposit in the whole road. That will people, cause we'd been poor for so many years when we made money, we're putting the banks because Sunday we know the disaster is coming so we can spend the money. So when the economy's bad, we still have the money to spend. You guys probably don't you worry.

Speaker 1:          14:32          And a second of thing at the China market, China been focusing on developing for the past 30 years. China government, sole Straw on investment. So Straw on exporting, but they're too weak on the domestic consumption's domestic consumption is not driven by government, is driven by intrepreneurship, driven by the market, not the government. So in the past two years, pastor to the years government is so strong now they get a week. It's our opportunity. It's our show time to see the market cademy entrepreneurship, how we can develop the real consumption. You know, I think if the China developed with a great consumption, we have a 300 million middle class in next to 15 to 20 years. We've got a half below middle class. We need to import a lot. So when we start to import, that's a great, it's going to I, I worry a lot when we export. You know, when we export, we got a terrible sky. We have a terrible water, we have a terrible work environment. When we started input, we got to be better. So that's all the grid opportunity guys. Be Happy about that.

Speaker 3:          15:47          I'm serious. I'm serious.

Speaker 4:          15:55          We Orient Yourself, don't worry. The reasons. Some of it's worried about China as we depend on you to buy our debt. However, I tried to be more Chinese when I was president, I saved a lot of money. So,

Speaker 3:          16:09          uh, I just wanted you to say that because

Speaker 4:          16:15          I really believe that. I mean, I think you're absolutely right. The trend toward greater internal consumption is I think will remain unbroken in spite of whatever the difficulties are in the next few months. I think it's important not to overreact. You can't break the trend. You got to clean up the land from chemical contaminants. You got to clean up the air, you're going to do it. Yeah. And a lot of Chinese will make a lot of money out of that will be a lot of great new companies and there'll be opportunities to import from other places. Yeah. So can you discuss your theory of what you're doing and other things in terms of whether it advances equal opportunity in social solidarity? Tell him what you think's going to happen and what other kinds of, when your opening remarks, you just say, uh, technology is going to be active in this way and other areas of the economy. What do you think the next big opportunities are? But first tell him just in two sentences what you're doing. Cause Jack and I know when we haven't been clear enough, explain it and explain how you think that advances social solidarity and equality of opportunity.

Speaker 1:          17:31          Well, our work is in

Speaker 5:          17:34          the belief that access to health information is a basic human right and that lab information, particularly because lab data drives 70% of clinical decisions needs to be accessible to people before they're sick. And so if you look at the word diagnose in the dictionary today, it says to determine the presence of disease from symptoms, which means by definition we're determining that people are sick once a disease has already progressed. And our work is in being able to make lab testing accessible to people in time for therapy to be affected. And to do that in a way in which every person you're respective of their insurance status, irrespective of where they live, can afford the ability to get a test done. So that means in our case, we've invested the last 12 years in now developing hundreds of tests, many of which are less than $10.

Speaker 5:          18:42          So in $2 tests in the United States. And I think one of the amazing things about this country is that we have such an incredible ecosystem for fueling creativity in that creativity can create new markets. So in answer to your question about the market being able to conform itself to social good, I think the creativity that goes into creating new these new technologies create new markets in and of themselves. And, and our basic belief that is that those new markets come from empowering individuals and in franchising individuals and trusting that individuals have the capability to engage with information and in accessing that information, beginning to take control of their own outcomes and their own health outcomes. And in doing so, changing the way our healthcare system works.

Speaker 4:          19:37          I think what this could mean for rural China. Yeah. For Rural India, for native American reservations in America, for the Mississippi Delta, for the remote area to where all the jobs for loss from cold, you're all of a sudden giving people information and uh, one of the most important things I think we did in my second term as president of the healthcare front was developed as Diabetes Self Care Program. And all of a sudden you could be Jack's company could be delivering the means to self care based on your test. I mean, I think that this is really, this is a very big deal. We all want to live as long and as well as we can. And Greg Brenner was here. We were joking about whether we'd make it to a hundred but in the meanwhile, do you want to keep people healthy? And if they're sick, you went to intervene early, not late.

Speaker 5:          20:33          Sure. When, and if you look at, I mean the ability to engage with this information. We have a $4 trillion health care problem in this country. 20% of it is type two diabetes, which is reversible. And we 90 million Americans who do not know they are prediabetic, but access to information and the ability to engage with that information is the foundation for being able to change those outcomes and costs. Right.

Speaker 1:          21:01          One more factor then I want to call it Jack, you founded this company 12 years ago, right? Yeah. Tell him how old you are. I was 19

Speaker 3:          21:10          so

Speaker 1:          21:16          don't worry about the future. We're in good hands and that was think of a new [inaudible] water. Where am nine tab? Not The past examination for university yet. I felt a three times, but I think it worked out. I'm not good at schooling. Well, yeah. That's why I give confidence to a lot of young people in China. If Jack Ma Can, success can be successful. 80% of the people can be successful.

Speaker 3:          21:43          People like hurry up with jealous.

Speaker 1:          21:46          Well, equality. I would like to make a lot of technology helping you because yesterday I was joining the United a u n a woman conference about gender equality and I think the first, the technology revolution happened 200 years ago in the UK. Release the human body, the arm stronger. The second the technology revolution that in the, in the u s if our advantage you can last law. But this technology of revolution relief release the brain. So this century is not a competition. Who's strong, who's muscles stronger is who is a smarter, who's soft, who can listen. It's the challenge of a wisdom. So man, women are equal on the Internet. You can never see his a woman or man on the Internet. Women can serve much better than the men on the Internet and a man talking about a business, talking about, you know, numbers, competition, the nic business, very code women, they can make business a very cozy lifestyle and interesting. 50% more than 50% of our shop owners, while they half 5 million shop owners are women. And people love that. I think this is, this is a great thing. I see that this century, we see more and more women leaders on the state leaders and the presidents in the future. We're going to general receptor of United Nations should be a woman leader at this is the greatest century for equality. And I, I feel excited about that.

Speaker 3:          23:19          Let me ask you that.

Speaker 1:          23:22          We're almost out of time, but one of the things that we haven't talked enough about here, not just here, but generally is whether the leap frogging we saw with cell phones, which was instrumental in your phenomenal business success and which will make it possible for you at the

Speaker 4:          23:46          appropriate time to do what you've done on a global scale hitherto unimaginable and all of human history for anybody to have any of their own health data. We haven't, we've seen examples but not the kind of dramatic penetration we need with energy and clean energy and enough and in short enough time to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. So do you believe

Speaker 3:          24:15          that,

Speaker 4:          24:17          I mean your country has done more than anybody else to try to put up solar panels and some of your companies went broke because you overdid it, right? But beforehand and you got to work out the phase out of the coal, the phases of the sun and all that. Meanwhile, Africa, which is growing like crazy because of the cell phone and no small measure. And as six of the fastest growing countries in the world still has vast swath of its land, totally dark at night.

Speaker 3:          24:47          Do you believe

Speaker 4:          24:48          that it's possible for us to scale up with distributed solar power is rather than central lives as quickly as we did with the cell phone? And if so, and if that were your business, if you had to quit what you're doing today and start there, how would you do it and how would you do it?

Speaker 1:          25:10          Did he at first I know that,

Speaker 5:          25:14          yeah, I'm, I'm such a huge believer in technology and I think especially right now we're at an incredible time in terms of new technology and the ability to apply technology in a scalable way towards solving some of these problems. So I would look at it in the context of some of the renewable solutions that we already have and in the context of empowering, connecting individuals with access to those solutions and in the context of creating markets around them, I think that there's real opportunity to actually create an ecosystem in which people can financially benefit from these solutions. And I think that's going to drive an adoption. I think in developing economies there's a revenue stream associated with that and the more we can turn even already some of the technologies that we have into markets, the more that we can fuel, I believe local growth and individual engagement in in beginning to adopt some of these solutions.

Speaker 4:          26:09          Just related to that would be Jack, you answer it and then I'll ask you one final.

Speaker 1:          26:13          Yeah. I am a strong believer that technology can make war much better because people say China economists getting slower, I'm happy about a 7% even 5% even 5% of the GDP of the number of chain of the second large economy is big enough. But yet you don't expect China keep on growing 11% cause like one body, one human body where your 1.8 meters tall, you cannot keep all like a 10% growth every year. You have to grow the quality, your mind, the wisdom. So I think China needs new technologies to solve this problems and which today the data, the, the, the clean technology, all these things that China is supposed to do. If we keep on the tradition, the old ways, we're going nowhere. This is why I feel excited because people asking you what is your dream now? Cause I never thought I would be today.

Speaker 1:          27:07          I can sit here talking to president. I'm like a guy you know, on the street and like filled of three times for university, five times four h for high key schools. I applied for 10 times and Harvard school or rejected. I never thought because of the tech and large because the Internet, it give me this opportunity. So I'm think when I retire, I don't want, the Chinese people have a terrible water to drink and it's safe for food and the money we make all spend in the hospital. That's disaster. So how we can use in the technology to enable young people the greater chance of this road. Don't worry about. We got to 1.4 billion people who are born in 1980s they are the people of the Internet Times. They are going to have new ways to solve the word problems. The things you're worried about today, they can solve it. And a human being have the these kind of worries for centuries. Uh, young people can always solve it and today when you have the right direction, cling encourage, you know, the, the, the climate change, all these issues they will be solved and these are the great opportunities ahead of us.

Speaker 3:          28:22          Anything else?

Speaker 5:          28:27          I agree with that. I think the more, the more we can, the more we can in franchise people, the more we can create ecosystems in which individuals are empowered, the more we give rights to individuals to be able to build businesses, to be able to, to pursue the economic benefit of technologies. The more you see these markets change

Speaker 1:          28:50          before they leave the stage, I want you to look at them and I want you to think about the time we have had to spend here dealing with the refugee problems in Syria and Lebanon. Stand up. Ellis, this is my friend Elliot Musafa. He's the education minister in Lebanon. He's got to educate all these kids

Speaker 3:          29:22          and

Speaker 1:          29:25          so he left a miracle that very much reflects the lives that Elizabeth and Jack have lived. He was in a very responsible position at the American of Dubai.

Speaker 4:          29:42          They started bringing American scholars over there to live in and and Arabic culture. He did all these wonderful things. Lebanon got in trouble. He went home to save his country. What is the difference? How much more could he in every smart Lebanese person do if they could focus on these things and why can he not? Because the place is dominated by people who think their differences are more important than their common humanity and our common challenges. You cannot imagine Jack Miles proud of being Chinese. I like that. He never hit it. He's, he's happy about it and the proud to be a global citizen. I imagine Elizabeth's proud to be a blonde haired, blue eyed American tech. No. Where's the northern California? Yes, but they don't, not a word either. One of them is sad, has defined the meaning of their lives. Are the direction of their work with negative reference to someone else. My friend Dikembe Mutombo stand up. No, you don't have to stand up. It'll hurt too much. You're an old man. My seven foot two or it's fall friend was just inducted into the National Basketball Association Hall of fame

Speaker 3:          31:13          and

Speaker 4:          31:23          my family, my whole family loves him and I have seen how much he has given back to his native country Congo, which has been sold troubles. I've known him a long time. We both went to Georgetown University. I did before he was born. I think I've never heard him say a resentful thing about anybody. I have seen him give and give and give and try to give the people in his native land opportunities. Why am I telling you this? He's had a good life because he never defined his life with negative reference to anybody else. He never begrudge anybody else's success and he thought he had an obligation to help other people. I'm telling you, this is the, we are back in a time of collective global insecurity

Speaker 3:          32:24          where

Speaker 4:          32:26          the main struggle is the oldest one in human history. Just in modern techno realities. I mean if you were trying to build the Middle East, you would think about our permanent sponsor here. The ambassador from Oman who tried to, her government tried to help head off a calamitous war in the Middle East over the nuclear issue in Iran. We all pray to God that it will work

Speaker 3:          32:57          and the lady she made you look around all these places, wherever

Speaker 4:          33:05          people are putting aside their differences and working together, good things are happening. We cannot achieve economic or social equality without living in the factual realities of the world. We face looking at the obstacles, looking at the opportunities, making the best decisions and those of us who even feel good about ourselves because we think we spend a lot of time giving. Our whole goal should be to work ourselves out of a job. One of the things that the bill and Tammy Austin it or sitting there with stark and they started giving away hearing aids and then they decided, well we better teach these young people how to speak. It's I get the gift of hearing. They'll have to learn that. So they got into the education distance. Sani Barky got into the education business and started somebody ought to do something really dramatic to remind people that the only people that really matter, the teachers, so he gave the first global teacher of the year award last year and an international panel gave the prize to a teacher from Maine who probably gave the entire million dollars to her school woman, never made any money in her life. She gave all the money away

Speaker 3:          34:20          immediately.

Speaker 4:          34:22          The future's going to be forged by people who think of how to use the modern tools that we're given as Elizabeth and Jack have to create opportunity through empowerment. And it will not be a straight line. It's too, too many moving parts.

Speaker 4:          34:49          But I just want you to think about that. The reason you feel good looking at them and that you identify with them even though they're different from you. And that's basically where we are all over again and we can't slip back. We can't give up. That's why we had the prime minister of Italy and George Soros talking about the future of Europe. And George said it was coming apart and the prime minister said, no, it doesn't have to come apart if it's about something more than economics. I thought it doesn't have to come apart if you will. It not to, and you put yourself on the line for it. There are no guaranteed outcomes today, but you can guarantee that the trend is right. So go ahead. You were gonna say something origin.

Speaker 3:          35:33          I just wanted to add, I mean it's, we were talking about the future and, and my own experience

Speaker 5:          35:37          and looking at all the faces here. I think a huge part of the answer to your question is also to raise our little girls with the stereotype that they can be the best in engineering and science and math because when they do, in all of these industries, it changes everything. And

Speaker 6:          35:54          we need to do that in this country and we need to do that as parents in other countries.

Speaker 1:          36:03          Yeah. I was thinking about if, uh, what you say, I'll think about when you, what, when you talk about the problems you're normally is like a politician. When you talk about the opportunities that the business people, I was thinking about how we can, using this, all the problems that change the problem become the opportunity. And um, I, I dunno, I just feel excited when people talk about problems. I think that's thing about if you can solve one of them, that's the chance. And today nobody in live in this century has so many opportunities and so many tools they can use the change other people's lives. And I think in, in the last century, which I'd call it time, this century is called the [inaudible] data technology. It is to empower yourself, make yourself strong. D t is to empower the others. When you pee, empower the others, you're empowered your future or yourself. So when I listen to talk, I agree and I think, uh, that's why we were born in this century. That's why we, uh, how we can use the internet to help them. What people, it's giving them a hand. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          37:46          Okay.
