Speaker 1:          00:04          Only explain to you how you can live an easy life, accomplishing goals and be successful and going out in the world and as tough. The only way to live an easy life is to basically give up on all your dreams and aspirations and just sit around doing nothing. Shit. The diseases is not worth accomplishing. Therefore a life that is easy. It's not even worth living. Nothing in this world is worth having or doing unless it means effort, pain, and difficulty. Would you listen to me? You are going to die. All of you, you all, your friends, your family, everyone you know, everyone you care about is going to die if you love life, not waste time because time is what life is made of.

Speaker 2:          01:01          If you respect and appreciate the time that you've been given while you out there doing what you want to do, what you need to be telling yourself is acceptable to be sitting around procrastinating and I no longer wants to be a loser. I no longer wanted to be offered. I know what it is that I want and I'm going to work hard and I'm going to get it.

Speaker 3:          01:19          When you want to succeed, as bad as you want to breathe, then you'll be successful. Somebody lost sleep more than a lot of success, and I'm here to tell you the day if you're going to be successful, you've got to be willing to give up sleep. You got to be willing to work off for three hours of sleep, two hours. If you really want to be successful, some days you will have to stay up three days in a row.

Speaker 4:          01:43          You don't need to if you don't really want to. Are you wanting success rather than actually working towards your dreams? A lot of you are just thinking about it. I have high hopes for everybody watching this. I want to remember your name.

Speaker 5:          02:07          It is not the things we do in life that we regret on our deathbed. It is the things we do not because I assure you I've done a lot of really stupid things. None of them bother me. All the mistakes and all the dopey things and all the time I was embarrassed. They don't matter. Find your passion and in my experience, no matter what you do at work, what you do in official settings, that passion will be grounded in people grounded in the relationships you have with people and what they think of you. When your time comes

Speaker 1:          02:57          in, the teeth stupefying odds, which is urine by in our ordinariness that are here. One thing I do every single day of my life trying to find somebody else change their life. I waited till 39 to get married because I had to wait that long to find someone. Her happiness was more important, and if nothing else, I hope that all of you can find that kind of passion and that kind of love in your life. Thank you.

Speaker 6:          04:03          We have granted the opportunity to understand why our eyes open and why they see what they do in the short time before they close forever.
