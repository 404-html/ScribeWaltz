Speaker 1:          00:08          Are complaining. We are making excuses and we do it everyday because it feels a lot better to shit on somebody else. Then look at yourself and shit on yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:22          whether it's one man, I don't look at anybody else. I have no fucking idea what you guys are up to and I shit on myself every day. I critique everything I do. Everything is my fault. Period. End of story. I can sit and dwell on all the things. Somebody hits me with a fucking car tomorrow. I'm like, fuck, I shouldn't have left the house that early. You get into that fucking mindset. I promise you shit changes. You need to fucking suffocate your bullshit. You're at this conference. That means you need to suffocate your bullshit period. Either need to figure out who's holding you back and their judgment and go to them. I want you to get out of this fucking conference. Go to your car or call your mom and say fuck you.

Speaker 2:          01:07          She's

Speaker 1:          01:08          the person that is suppressing you because she's miserable and misery loves company. I'm being dead serious with you. I understand it's not a popular thing to say. I understand, but there's only a couple of things that I'm seeing in the world today, which is people aren't doing things because they're fearful of other people's judgments, which usually comes from parenting or environment or circumstance, and they're still keeping negative energy around them because they're obligated and I get it. I have negative people in my life too that I keep around as well, but to let that dictate your only life is fucking ludicrous and all I know. How about, let me actually, you know what? I'm going to give you a real weird one. I want every person to do me a huge favor. If you really want to know what's running through my fucking body, go volunteer at a nursing home for one day.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Go volunteer at a nursing home for one day. Number one, it's just a nice thing to do and you'll probably feel pretty awesome about it. Number two, don't talk to eight people. Six, four, you're going to see something that is going to scare the living shit out of here. It's called regret. Regret, scares the shit out of me. Regret is the fuel besides gratitude that drives my life. You will see people and they will tell you things about the things they didn't do and the silliness to why they didn't do it and they're running out of time. You sit in this room and you have time. You have time. If you're 70 80 90 of time, if you're 15 you've time, but to sit and list all the reasons you can't. It's just, here's how I look at it. If anybody that looks like you has ever done it, then you can too.

Speaker 1:          02:44          If you know, if some kid that grew up with two alcoholic parents, right and grew up in an orphanage made it, you can too. It's not necessarily that I don't believe in luck or circumstance. I believe in all of that. I really, I understand that this is not about that. It's about mindset. The second you start having losing mindset, you've already fucking lost. I love when people think shit like the secret is real fucking real. Here's how it works. Friends. If you actually are optimistic and you make a goal and your actions map to it, you've miraculously get somewhere close to it. Sitting on your couch, jerking off and saying, I wish I had $1 million.

Speaker 1:          03:30          The amount of people talking big game in this office, in this room office, clearly I use that a lot. The amount of people talking big game at this conference right now where their ambitions don't match their actions. I mean people rolling around here and say they're going to make 100 million a year and then take the whole weekend off. Then I have nothing going for themselves yet. Do you know quiet my head is, do you know how quiet my head is? My head is soup. It is super quiet in here. You know why no voices allowed. No voices allowed. Not My wife's, not my kids, not my business partners, not my parents. Nobody. I'm in it for me in my own mind. The reason I can give so much to everybody else, it's because I'm good because I made it with myself. Period. End of story

Speaker 1:          04:23          and I've been talking about a lot of things and the reason I'm going further down this rabbit hole of tuned out everybody else is as I've gotten to know people like, oh, they're scared because their partner makes fun of them all the time. Like it's just, it's just very basic behavior, right? It's very basic behavior and so I just don't want that for you anymore. Like has anybody realize guys, it's 400 trillion to one. The odds of being in this fucking room right now is 400 trillion to one. The fact that your mom and dad had sex at that exact second to create you is fucking insane and we are wasting it away and I just don't want you to do that mainly because I get a high off of the email that you send me in six years about this suffocating conversation.

Speaker 2:          05:13          Okay?

Speaker 1:          05:13          Content and distribution. Content and distribution. You have to make stuff. Figure out what kind of content producer you are. Are you good at writing? Are you good at talking? Are you good in front of video? Everybody thinks, oh, videos. The answer, not the answer. If you suck on video, can you talk? Can you write? Are you charismatic in front of a camera? All three are trying to video and written word audio. They play forever. Figuring out which one you're good at and go deep into that. Everybody's trying to make you fix all your shortcomings. Fuck your shortcomings, triple down on your strengths and is your biggest advantage.

Speaker 2:          05:54          Please leave

Speaker 1:          05:55          this conference. Figure out first you want to sell. Actually, before I figure out what you want your life to be. Do you really want all that money? Do you really want to let them? What do you want? Figured that out. Then figure out what you want to sell your time, your service, a product. I don't care. A festival. I figure out something you believe in that you sell and then finally, number three, figured out how to let the world know about it at the lowest possible cost. Today, if it's under 30 year olds, that's instagram influencers and snapchat ads. They're $3 CPMS. Everybody writes off snapchat because instagram copies all its features. That's exactly when I went all in on snapchat the last three months and I'm buying awareness at a price I've never seen before. If the person is under 30

Speaker 2:          06:38          okay,

Speaker 1:          06:39          be a practitioner. I get a lot of accolades. Yeah. Gary, I, why do you think I do all this content so I do it?

Speaker 2:          06:47          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:47          I built my personal brand, not necessarily for the brand halo effect to keep me in check to always be on top of shit. I'm in the green right now. Tweeting and texting and consuming and creating content. I'm putting in work every day work and I know the nuances of a filter and a geo location and the copy of a facebook post, like everybody's talking about this stuff doesn't work. No, no, you don't work you the ambition. If you, if you fucking came to this conference, you clearly want something. So if that's the case, how do you not have 30 hours to go do research on how to do this shit? For Real. I'll give you a free resource on how to post ads on facebook, how to find influencers on Instagram, how to do snapchat better, how to do linkedin better. They'll give you free reshot resource right now. Here it is. G. O. O. G. L. E.

Speaker 2:          07:52          You

Speaker 1:          07:52          want something? Go fucking get it. It's called search engine. How do I post better on instagram and turn? My friends are being serious. I know it's funny but I'm flabbergasted by people hitting me up. Gary, how do I get it? You know I want to apply for it. I saw you meant literally the scene. The snap on the way. This is Gary saw your hiring content creators. I do that. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? Calm asshole. And you apply and be like, why do we need, you have the self start. You have to self start. If you believe like I do that mobile devices have the consumer's attention and that facebook, instagram, snapchat, youtube, podcasts have the percentage of time. By the way, this is not a debate. This is data. They own it besides games and utility. It's social networks. You may not like it. You may not like the teenage girl duck faces 24 hours a day. It doesn't matter because I've got news for you. You're 40 year old sister's duck facing too. It's 2017

Speaker 2:          09:08          okay.

Speaker 1:          09:08          What do you think is coming next? Are you ready for augmented reality? Are you ready for machine learning, for Ai, for messengers, for Vr? I mean, look, how many people here are retiring within the next 10 years and I don't mean you're going to crush it and buy a fucking island. I mean, you're old and you're fucking finished.

Speaker 2:          09:30          Great.

Speaker 1:          09:30          [inaudible] your hand if you're retiring in 10 years.

Speaker 1:          09:34          Understood. Okay. For the 21 of you, you can take some of this with some level of grain of salt, but for the rest of you, everything, I believe in everything that is converting and creating your business opportunities in today's world did not exist 12 years ago. All of it. Not facebook, not smartphones, not youtube, not snapchat, none of it. What do you think happens next? Can you imagine if I told you 10 years ago that you would prefer your teenage girl to take a drive with a stranger than drive herself? Would you believe that we're living through massive social norm changes? Number, how weird it was to online date, not so much anymore. We don't live in through massive human shifts. This is the biggest culture shift since the printing press. The Internet is only roughly 20 years old in being a consumer product for all of us.

Speaker 1:          10:26          This is just starting and the level of disrespect or the level of, it's kind of something the unbelievable nature of you not becoming ridiculously educated in this shit blows my mind. You can not have the audacity for ambition in the future world without putting in hundreds of hours of homework to the nuances of had a creek communications and distributed them on this device. Your ass. If you don't do it and I don't want outsourcing to nieces and I don't want fucking bullshit excuses and I don't want to hear that you're not good on camera then fucking right rick, I don't care. But you need to fucking make a decision today. Are you going to allow yourself to buy bullshit programs for the rest of your life and come to shit like this or are you going to finally fucking eat shit and do something about it?

Speaker 2:          11:18          Are you, are you

Speaker 1:          11:21          going to fuck him for 10 or are you going to make pretend you're a business person cause it feels nice. Or are you going to become a business person paying your big to look? The part is a great business for other people. Eating shit for a decade and doing it for yourself is a good one for you in that eating shit decade. If you actually get smart and stop fucking judging every new thing that comes along. And you know what's so funny to me? What's the funny of me is people that get fancy, let me on this fancy like the shit out of it. The amount of people that aren't where they want to be.

Speaker 2:          12:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:02          And did say, well, I don't have time for facebook. I don't have time to learn another APP like snapchat yet. You're not winning.

Speaker 2:          12:12          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:16          I don't get them a man. I don't understand. You're not where you're at. You'd rather spend thousands of dollars on dumb shit to somebody teaching you some fucking secret that doesn't exist. Then you spending the 40 hours to learn the newest thing even if it dies. Let me tell you the story about Social Cam. Social camp came out six years ago. I spent a fucking 50 60 a hundred hours on it, figuring it out, right? That's what I did and worked for about four months and then the whole thing collapsed and nobody gave a fuck about social camp wastes of time or in those learnings on a mobile first video platform. Did I learn what made me bet unbind number two, I bet on vine vine comes out. Everybody's like, who gives a fuck? Six seconds videos stupid. I'm like, not me. I'm going to learn everything about this.

Speaker 1:          12:59          I'm going to be friends with everybody. What happens with fine. That's pretty good. I get a, I started an agency representing a bunch of talent with Jerome Jarre. We make a couple of bucks but I learned, I learned alert. What happens with vine dies, but what happens next? Instagram video and what happens in the last year for me on instagram video, the last four years of me learning mobile first video dynamics on two things I wasted my time on. Even though I had hundreds of millions of dollars, I wasn't too fucking fancy to put in the work at two o'clock in the morning cause I'm fucking hungry and I back at the fuck up. Then instagram comics, then instagram comes and then I hit pay dirt six years in the making a whole lot of losing along the way, but learning my craft, learning my craft. I end with this. My friends in Utah, do you actually know what the fuck you're doing? Are you actually putting in the work? Do you really want this that bad or do you want to make it look like you want it that bad? I challenge you and I hope to see you soon. Thank you.
