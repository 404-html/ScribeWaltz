Speaker 1:          00:12          Flesh but have the power to destroy strongholds. God did not design to be in bondage to anything, to anyone, to any southern states. You were made in the image and a creator, and that creator is wholeness. Completeness, Great Ness. The only place you can find true freedom is in the presence of the Almighty. Today I'm going to give you seven steps to your breakthrough. Steps are universal. You can apply to any area of your life. Step one course that means you got to get along with every time you get alone with God, you give birth to something. See breakthroughs about persistent. You got to do whatever it takes to put yourself in a position to hear God. God has a crimp to power that your enemy cannot withstand when in order for you to access it, you've got to come into his presence implementing in effective ways for your situation now by your religion.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Retail, always buy it wholesale. Go to the original sauce, the truth, the place where it hasn't been diluted hasn't been polluted. Go to the sauce. I'm not talking to you about theory right now. What I'm telling you was the moment I started getting alone every single day with God is the moment my life started to change. Now I'm going to close this step out with scripture so you understand what I'm telling you is rooted in the word more. At 1:35 says very early in the morning while it was still dark, Jesus got up and went off to a solitary place where he prayed spiritual intimacy window and impregnates us with the paddle and needed to get barb to his plane. Step number two, detox and emotionally that this is rooted in Ephesians four, 30 1:32. It says, get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind to capacity to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ. God forgave you. For Kevin, this is dialysis one I'm telling you to do with the stem is to examine your spiritual calls in for traces of the enemy. You have to make room for success. You have to make room for your breakthrough in your spirit, which will cause you are full of resentment and anger, bitterness or jealousy.

Speaker 1:          03:22          There's no room for success. There's no room for peace. Your future is too important to let it be held hostage by the past. Let it go. Now, when I say forgiveness, I don't mean that you have to agree with the wrong done to you. It just declares that you refuse to be held in bondage by it. Any your future is worth it.

Speaker 2:          03:51          Oh, worked it, but that's the goal.

Speaker 1:          03:54          Some of the things that had been done to you might be so deeply rooted in you that you can't let go of it on your own. Now you remember it. Let's. Let's look back to that first step that I told you earlier about getting in the presence of God daily, getting alone with God daily, and you come into his presence and you laid this bitterness and this anger and resentment and all the hurts and roles that have been done to you. When you come into his presence, can you lay that stuff on the altar and say, Lord, here it is. Help me get rid of this stuff. Tell me, get rid of anything in the way of your plan for my life, but I can hear those chains falling off where you embrace your freedom, your freedom. You are not a slave in the breakthrough where we all life freedom, trust God with your past. Give it to him. Absolute surrender restores absolutely. Step three for your breakthrough. You've got to create a powerful vision for your vickery and your mind. You've got to be able to see what's your breakthrough. Looks like vision as the greenness breakthroughs must be first.

Speaker 1:          05:18          You can't go someplace where there is no vision. The people perish. Imagination is the womb that will get better to your future. They walk through life without a vision in a constant state of confusion and God is not in the confusion. Think outside the box by moving your mind into the realm of unlimited possibilities, but then the construction right now, creating your mind today that you want to live in tomorrow to find and in great detail, paypal, what you watch your victory look like, so you gotta keep your eyes on the prize and you're fishing in front of you. It's critical and biblical. That's your right and down. Habakkuk two, two says, write the vision. Make it plain so they he didn't read and can run with it. Write it down. Step forward to your breakthrough. Adopt the mindset of the unstoppable discipline. Mine rooted in the truth is the chiropractor other mind, every situation, every trial and tribulation has the mindset required to overcome it.

Speaker 1:          06:40          Thinking if the stain alone enough will eventually bring peace and order any situation. Now, let's go to the word we demolish arguments and every brick tension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. To change our behavior, we must address the thinking that produces it. Stop attacking the fruit and get down to the root. The word says, be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Show me your thinking and I will show you your tomorrow. Adopt the mindset of a. It starts right between ears. The battlefield is over the mind and you've got to win that every single day you get on day in and day out. You can't take a day off. Your breakthrough must be possessed in your mind. Did it there and you have it in a physical stamp.

Speaker 1:          07:41          Five to clear the breakthrough. Your mouth is a creative device designed to call for the food of trump says death and life on the power to tone. Those in love is the fruits. There are some big life, big factory. Make the breakthrough. The words you speak aloud will prove allegiance to the God you serve. You either serve in God, have faith on a condom down the kind of boldness and courage and asked for me and my house. We will serve the Lord. Declared a breakthrough in your mouth, mirrors they interstate of your relationship with God. Do you believe? If a person who didn't know you overheard your conversation, would they know that you saw? Would they think that that God you started has limits on it all takes a call for things that be not as though they were the victory. Step number six, master the art of blindness.

Speaker 1:          08:52          Bagging doesn't move God. Faith is the only language spoken in destiny is obligated by universal love to concede to the demand of master. The Art of blindness. Doubt is the play. Naysayers around you must be quarantined when you're going through trials and tribulations, nothing but warriors and soldiers around you. You've got to get all those people that doubt out of your life and your family. There's people in your family speaking death, though when you got to shut them down, you got to shut down. All the enemy still has the power and ability to gain access to the mouth of a righteous person. The enemy will use anyone around you to sow seeds of defeats over your life. Just like I spoke to you about the last step about declaring the blessing. The enemy uses the same principle in reverse. He's got to declare and the curse over you, and if it can get you to do it, he will find someone around you to do it.

Speaker 1:          10:06          So let's go to the war and all things whatsoever you ask in prayer, believing you sound real. Faith is never subject to circumstances. It's unconditional. It has nothing to do with your physical senses. What you saying what to hear, what you taste, what you smell, how you feel. None of that. Faith is more than words. It's an unconditional activity, a continuous accident over refusing to accept what's current circumstances. I believe in the promise. I believe in one God says nothing. Nothing can make me believe otherwise. Stop focusing on your problems and stay focused on the two. Oh, things will not change your circumstances. Faith will step towards. Faith is a step towards power. The more you move from making decisions based on your feelings to data, true faith, God's power you will have access to when expectations and dreams collide, they explore. Wouldn't matter if a station is the oxygen that breathes life into your dreams. I'm gonna. Leave you with one last thing here on this step is not the length of the prayer that gives it power, is the faith behind. Keep it simple, ask once and never stopped believing. The final step. Number seven, plug into the power changes. Every thing it touches. God is love and whatever is not love. It's not of God.

Speaker 1:          11:55          Infinite vibration that reaches to the core of everything in existence. It is by far the most powerful thing in the universe. Oh, miracles originated from it. Powers of nature, bound to it. Oh, success isn't breakthroughs. Hinge on it. We overcome not my force. Mike's Money, knowledge, talents we are not because of what we do, but because God loves us. What Jesus did, my Sauna Cross empowers us by grace to break through the barriers. You are God's ambassador owner when a single agenda and that's to love.

Your shits and outcomes become limitless. Love is a superhighway. No the travel on and are destined to impact the world. It is the master key that grants access to the spare room of all creation. To love is the highest display of wisdom, the highest form of trust, and the highest form of worship. Shift from a state of needing love, bleeding, love, never in a room with Alex. never go a day without it released this catalyst of change I to every environment you infiltrate.

Speaker 3:          15:08          I'm Billy Brooks. Blessed that unstoppable. The first step to success is to get your mind right.

Speaker 2:          15:25          The second step is to get your mouth right. The words are a direct reflection of the beliefs that you have internalized. I could spend two minutes with you in conversation and by the words and the faith that I feel behind those words, I can tell you exactly what you're going in. Life Word set outcomes in motion. God has given us the power to create with our mouse. When you are going through the trial, the challenge, the struggle, whatever it is you're facing, your mind, your faith and your mouth are your weapons. Success has to be spoken into existence by either moving you closer or further away. I'm going to tell you the secret. When you learn to tame your tongue, you take control of your destiny. You'll get behind the steering wheel. When your mouth matches your man which aligns with your faith, nothing can stop you.

Y'All mail carries full command of the room around you. You have the ability to bless, curse. He'll destroy every time you order something out of your mouth. Acknowledging this transformative power is essential to building a life of success rate through in the mind. What is your mouth that initiates the change? In order to seize possession of the victory, you have to do that with words so shall my word be that going forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it still accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing were two half sentence. Now it's time to declare the blessing. Every sale, muscle, tissue, ligament, bone system in my body. It's bullshit into perfection which God intended a function I call forth healing complete rest of the race today and I will heal then I won't say it the Lord.

Alcohol, drugs last three, bitterness or jealousy, unforgiveness, eating disorders, panic attacks, ptsd, cancer, heart attacks, strokes. None of these things have dominion over me.

Speaker 2:          21:19          I got goals, dreams, and a vision so big, so massive that it scares me if I say my intentions. If I want to collate my destiny out loud with people around that will be a high probability that they would attempt to have me Baker acted on grounds, that I'm delusional, that I'm crazy, that I've lost all sense of reality.

Speaker 2:          22:50          I don't hope that God still moves. I know he does. Therefore, I pick up my five stones for my slingshot and I fear not the modern take Elias, the diocese. It gives me the walls of Jericho and the armies and riches come. Today's pharaohs. I locked my eyes on the prize and without any doubt or hesitation or anxiety, I'm pressed for waving the banner of the one true God and I slayed it. Enemies who whispered doubt and fear in my ears. For years, that same spirit and many claim died off at the end of the book of acts has landed on coachable fire deep on the inside of me to do what the world keeps on saying it's impossible.
