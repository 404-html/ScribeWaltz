Speaker 1:          00:08          The next best predictor of lifetime success is conscientiousness. Well, so, and I've though of the two aspects of conscientiousness say orderliness and industriousness. The better predictor is industriousness. So the question is, well, what can you do about your industriousness? And the answer to that is, well that's Kinda rough too because there's a strong genetic component, but you can work on micro habits with regards to your conscientiousness and I think the best micro habits. This is partly to do with this future authoring program processes. I think the best thing you can do with regards to your conscientiousness is to set up some aims for yourself. Goals that you actually value and the future authoring program helps people do that. And basically it does a situational analysis of it helps you do a situational analysis of your life more than a psychological analysis I would say. And so the questions are something like, well, all right, you're going to have to put some effort into your life and you need to be motivated to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:06          And so what are the potential sources of motivation? You could think about them in the big five manner. You know, if you're extroverted, you want friends, if you're agreeable, you want an intimate relationship. If you're disagreeable, you want to win competitions. If you're open, you want to engage in creative activity. If you're high in neuroticism, you want security. Okay? So those are all sources of potential motivation that you could draw on that you could tailor to your own, you know, your own personality. But then there are dimensions that you want to consider your life across. And so we asked people about, well, you know, if you could have your life the way you wanted it in three to five years, if you were taking care of yourself properly, you know, what would you want from your friendships? What would you want from your intimate relationship? How would you like to structure your family?

Speaker 1:          01:47          What do you want for your career? Well, how are you going to use your time outside of your job and how are you going to regulate your mental, physical, mental, and physical health, and maybe also your drug and alcohol use. Because that's, that's a good place to Auger down, you know, because alcoholism, for example, wipes out, you know, five to 10 percent of people, so you want to keep that under control and then, and then so maybe you know, you, you, you develop a vision of what your life, what you would like your life to be and that associates the, so the goal, once the goal is established and then you break down the goal into micro processes that you could implement the microprocesses become rewarding in proportion in relation to there a causal association with the goal and that tangles in your, your incentive reward system.

Speaker 1:          02:35          You know, we talked about the dopaminergic incentive reward system, but that's the thing that keeps you moving forward. And the way it works is that it works better if it produces positive emotion. When it can see you moving towards a valued goal, okay, well what's the implication of that? Better have a valued goal because otherwise you can't get any positive motivation working out. And so the more valuable the goal in principle, the more the micro processes associated with that goal start to take on a positive charge. And so what that means is while you get up in the morning and you're excited about the day, you're ready to go, and so as far as I can tell, what you do is you specify your longterm ideal. Maybe you also specify a place you want to stay the hell away from them so that you're terrified to fail as well as excited about succeeding because that's also useful.

Speaker 1:          03:22          You specify your goal. You do that, you do that in some sense as a unique individual. You want to. You want to specify goals that make you say, Oh, if that could happen as a consequence of my efforts, it would clearly be worthwhile because the question always is, why do something? Because doing nothing is easy. You just sit there and you don't do anything. How it's real easy. The question is why would you ever do anything? And the answer to that has to be because you've determined by some means that it's worthwhile. And then the next question might be, well, where should you look for worthwhile things? And one would be, well, you could consult your own temperament, and the other would be, while you kinda look at how, look at what it is that people accrue that's valuable across the lifespan. Look what, look what.

Speaker 1:          04:05          So you do a structural analysis of the subcomponents of human existence and already good that you need a family. You need friends, like you don't need to have all these things, but you better have most of them. Family, friends, career, educational goals, plans for time outside of work and attention to your mental and physical health, etc. You know those are, that's what life is about. And if You don't have any of those things, well then all you've got left is misery and suffering. So that's, that's a bad, that's a bad deal for you. So, so once you, once you set up that goal structure, let's say, and that's really in many in many ways, that's what you should be doing at universities is that's exactly what you should be doing is trying to figure out who it is that you're trying to be, right, and you aim at that and then use everything you learned as a means of building that person that you want to be.

Speaker 1:          05:00          And and I really mean want to be, I don't mean should be even those things, those things are going to overlap and it's important to distinguish between those because that's partly, and this is back down to the micro routine analysis. So I started saying, well, you're going to try to make yourself more industrious. Okay? Number one, specify your damn goals because how are you going to hit something if you don't know what it is that isn't going to happen. And often people won't specify their goals too because they don't like to specify conditions for failure. So if you keep yourself all vague and foggy, which is real easy because that's just a matter of not doing as well, then you don't know when you fail and people might say, well, I really don't want to know when I fail because that's painful, so I'll, I'll keep myself blind about when I fail.

Speaker 1:          05:39          ThAt's fine, except you'll fail all the time. Then you just won't know it until you've failed so badly that you're done. And that can easily happen by the time you're 40. So. So I would recommend that you don't let that happen. So that's willful blindness, right? You could have known, but you chose not to. Okay? So once you get your goal structure set up, you think, okay, if I could have this life looks like that might be worth living, despite the fact that it's going to be anxiety provoking and threatening, and there's gonna be some suffering and loss involved in all of that. Obviously the goal is to have a vision for your life such that all things considered that justifies your effort. Okay? So then what do you do? Well then then you turn down to the micro routines like, okay, well this is what I'm aiming for, how does that instantiates itself day to day, week to week, month to month, and that's where something like a schedule can be unbelievably useful.

Speaker 1:          06:33          Google calendar. It's like make a damn schedule and stick to it. Okay, so what's the rule with the schedule? It's not a bloody prison. That's the first thing that people do wrong. He said, well I don't like to follow a schedule. Was like, well what kind of schedule are you setting up? Well I, I have to do this, then I have to do this, then I have to do this, you know, and then I just go play video games because who wants to do all these things that I have to do? It's like wrong. Set the damn schedule up so that you have the day you want. That's the trick. It's like okay, I've got tomorrow. If I was going to set it up so it was the best possible day I could have practically speaking, what would it look like? Well then you schedule that and obviously there's a bit of responsibility that's going to go along with that because if you have any sense, one of the things that you're going to insist upon is that at the end of the day, you're not in worse shape than you were that then at the beginning of the day, right?

Speaker 1:          07:26          Because that's a stupid day. If you have a bunch of those in a row, you just dig, dig yourself a hole, and then you bury yourself in. It's like, sorry, that's just not a good strategy. It's a bad strategy. So maybe 20 percent of your day has to be responsibility and obligation, or maybe it's more than that, depending on how far behind you are, but even that you can. You can ask yourself, okay, well I've got these responsibilities. I have to schedule the damn things in. What's the right ratio of responsibility to reward? And you can ask yourself that just like you'd negotiate with someone who is working for you. It's like, okay, you gotta work tomorrow. Okay, so I want you to work tomorrow. And you might say, okay, well what are you going to do for me that makes it likely that I'll work for you while you could ask yourself that, you know, maybe you do an hour of, of responsibility and then you play a video game for 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          08:14          I don't know, whatever turnS your crank man, but you know, you have to negotiate with yourself and not tyrannized yourself like you're negotiating with someone that you care for that you would like to be productive and have a good life. And, and that's how you make the schedule. It's like. And then you look at the day and you think, well, if I had that day, that'd be good. Great. You know, and you, you're useless and horrible. So you'll probably only hit it with about 70 percent accuracy, but that beats the hell out of zero. Right? And if you hit it even with 50 percent accuracy, another rule is well, aim for 51 percent the next week or 50 and a half percent for god's sake. Or because you're going to hit that position where things to loop back positively and spiral you upward. And soul, so that's one way that you can work on your conscientiousness is a plan, a life you'd like to have and and you do that partly by referring to social norms.

Speaker 1:          09:09          That's more or less rescuing your father from the belly of the whale, but the other way you do that is by having a little conversation with yourself about it as if you don't really know who you are because you know what you're like. You won't do what you're told. You won't do what you tell yourSelf to do. You must have noticed that. It's like you're a bad employee and a worse boss, and in both of those work for you, you don't know what you want to do. And then when you tell yourself what to do, you don't do it anyways. You should fire yourself and find someone else to beat. But, but you know what my point is, is that you have to understand that you're not your own servant, so to speak. You're someone that you have to negotiate with and that's. And you're someone that you want to present the opportunity of having a good life too.

Speaker 1:          09:52          And that's hard for people because they don't like themselves very much, so you know, they're always like cracking the whip and then procrastinating and cracking the whip and then procrastinating and it's like, god, it's so boring and such a pathetic way of spending your time. And you know what that's like because you probably wasted like six hours a day and I think we did an economic calculation about that a while back, right? Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an hour, something like that. I mean, you're not getting paid that now, but you're young. And so this is investment time and what you do now is going to multiply its effects in the future. So, so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour, which is perfectly reasonable. So if you waste six hours a day and you are, then you're wasting about $2,000 a week or about $100,000 a year.

Speaker 1:          10:33          So like go ahead. But that's what it's costing you every hour. and you need to know what your damn time is worth. So let's say it's not 50 bucks, it's 30, whatever. Maybe it's 100, it's somewhere in that range. One of the things you should be asking yourself is when you spend an hour was that, well, what have I paid someone 50 bucks to have had that hour, and if the answer is no, it's like, well, maybe you should do something else with your time, and it depends on whether or not you think that your time is worthwhile. But the funny thing about not assuming that is if you assume your time isn't worthwhile, what happens is you don't just sit around sort of randomly in a state of responsibility list bliss. What you do is you suffer existentially and so that seems like a stupid solution, so okay, so anyways, as far as I can tell, that's how you can improve your conscientiousness, hannah, outline and goal that you actually would like to hit and even better, here's something else you can think about when you're negotiating in your life.

Speaker 1:          11:32          You could say if you're kind of pessimistic, you'd say, well, we have to negotiate an agreement. I'd like to walk away not miserable and resentful. okay, let's call that a baseline and that's how you're going to negotiate with your wife or your husband. That's a good thing to know. You want to negotiate so that you don't walk away miserable and resentful because that makes you hostile and then you'll to hurt them and I would say that unless you want to hurt them and then of course they'll happily return the favor unless you. If you want to exist in a place where you're basically hitting each other in the head repeatedly for 30 years, you go right ahead. But I wouldn't say that that's a particularly good way of living. So you might say, well, the minimal precondition for a successful negotiation is that you don't walk away resentful and angry.

Speaker 1:          12:15          And so that's also how you know when you have something to say to someone because the rule has to be. If you're going to walk away resentful and angry, you've got something to say. It doesn't mean you're right by the way, but it does mean that you have something to say, but it's kind of a low bar. You know, like if I wanted to live with you for 30 years, maybe we should say, how about we walk away from our mutual negotiations? Thrilled. Well why not? You know, you got to aim for something you could aim for that you want to negotiate with your boss for a new seller. You might think, okay, I've got this damn job, how much would I have to be paid? So I'd be so bloody excited to go to work. I could hardly stand it while you can at least know what that number is.

Speaker 1:          12:57          And then you could go there and say, well look, you know, you like to have me around. I've been doing some thinking. I think if you paid me this amount of money, I'd be so thrilled to go to work that you could hardly even keep me away from here. And your boss might think, wow, I'd actually really like to have someone around who would be so thrilled to work that I can't get rid of them. so like maybe I'll, well I can't give you all of that. I'll give you 75 percent. Maybe we can renegotiate it in a year. It's like, hey, good deal, or you can be some weasley coward and go in there and snuggle about how awful your life is and walk away, barely able to tolerate outcome of the negotiation. So like I wouldn't recommend that and it's funny because I've watched people do this repeatedly in my clinical practice because I do, we do.

Speaker 1:          13:42          We plan all the time because the rule is you're can come and see me. I'm going to try to help you figure out how to have the life that you want to have and we're going to think about that strategically. So you're making $50,000 a year right now. Maybe you should be making $150,000 in three years. And they think, well that couldn't happen. It's like not with that attitude. That's the first thing. It's like, no, that's not going to happen if you, if you don't ask people for the damn money, if you don't look for a better job, but they're going to come along and just shovel a boat full of money at you. It's like, no, that's not going to happen, but if why is that impossible? Look at you, you people in here. it's like, what the hell is wrong with you? Nothing.

Speaker 1:          14:23          So you probably have what you want. If you could figure out what the hell it was and then you know, you diligently pursued it. So. and then maybe you wouldn't whine about being alive. That'd be good because people who whined about being alive or dangerous to themselves and other people. So you might think I can have what I want, but you better well figure out what it is and you can't just wait for the like have what you want fairy to show up at your doorstep and granted because obviously that's not going to happen. So. So conscientiousness, while we talked about how you could improve that social networking, that's another big deal. It's one of the advantages that older people have over younger people. And so for example, now that I'm in my fifties, roughly speaking, I know a bunch of other people who are relatively well positioned in the dominance hierarchy and they know all sorts of people.

Speaker 1:          15:09          and so when I go to one of them and say, can you do x or do you know x? They say no, but I know someone who cat. And that's a huge advantage. So another thing that you want to think about as you move through life and this is, is that use your ability to network properly. And that doesn't mean schmooze and it doesn't mean go out and impress people. That's all just complete bloody rubbish. It means you, you, you try to surround yourself with people who are competent in multiple different dimensions and you maintain your relationships with them. And that's a trading relationship to right? It involves research, reciprocity, but it's a huge advantage. A social network is a huge advantage and that's something extroverted people can be really good at because you know they have that sort of social ability and that goes along with the ability to sell.

Speaker 1:          15:52          So another place that you can pick up power and power for the good, for the right things is to, is to consciously develop and maintain your social networks. And that also means, well, let's talk about friendships for a minute. Here's how you know, if someone's, your friend A you can tell them bad news and they'll lIsten. They won't tell you why you know you're stupid and why that bad thing happened to you and how something worse happened to them once and you know, derailed the whole conversation. you can actually tell them bad news and they'll listen. So that's a good thing. And then this is a weirder thing. You can tell them good news and they'll help you celebrate. And that's a really good way of deciding who you should have around you. Because if you have someone around you, you know somethIng good happens to you and you're kind of afraid to even admit it because you know god, something good happen to you.

Speaker 1:          16:44          It's like you let that be known and will certainly be taken away. So you know, you come out and you sort of tell someone halfheartedly that something good happened to you, they give you a whack and then talk about, you know, the great thing that happened to them three years ago or worse, the great thing that happened to someone that they knew three years ago, you know, it's like go away from that person. They're not helpful to you and they're not helpful to themselves either. And so you want to surround yourself. You've got to think about this. You've got to surround yourself with people who want the best for the best part of you. You can hang around with weasels and losers that are trying to pull you down to justify the fact that they're spiraling downhill as well. And you know, the upside of that is you don't have to have any responsibility and he can all whine about how wretched life is, you know.

Speaker 1:          17:28          So that's pretty attractive. But I would say it's also a bad medium to longterm plan. And so it's, it's acceptable and desirable to try to surround yourself with people who were facilitating your development. You know when you might say, well, I've got people around, I know them well, you know they're, they're, they're not doing that well and and there and they don't fit into that category. It's like, what's your point? What are you going to do with them? Exactly. You feel if they'll listen and cooperate with you and move towards a better future, great. If they don't pay any attention and they keep doing the same damn things over and over and they're not going anywhere and is painful, then maybe the proper thing to do is say, you just have your misery. I'll go off and have my life and maybe you'll wake up at some point in the future and think that's a better way of being because just putting up with it is while they call that enabling, right?

Speaker 1:          18:22          You put up with that sort of behavior. You're providing tacit consent for it and even tacit approval. It's like it's bad idea. You have, I would say both the right and the responsibility to surround yourself with people who are good for the best part of you and that's not the same as you know. I don't have to elaborate on that. You can figure out what that means. Skills, that's another thing you can do and if you want to increase your probability of success every time you have an opportunity to take an opportunity that would provide you with a new skill. Do it right. Learn to program, learn to write, learn to read, read new things, learn to public speak. Learn how to introduce yourself to people. Learn how to social network, learn how to go talk to your boss in a matter. This is the right way to go.

Speaker 1:          19:08          Talk to someone who's supervising you. I see this problem and here's the solution and so I'm coming to talk to you about the problem and the solution. It's like that person is going to want to talk to you a lot site because the other people they're talking to, you are going to come and say, I've got a problem. Can you do something about it? It's like they don't want to do something about it. They already got 50 things to do, you know, so if you're the person who constantly brings forth a problem, even if they're accurate problems, is why are they going to want to have you around? It's you're just, you're just another problem. Don't be a problem for the people who want to give you money. That's a good rule of thumb, man. You know, if someone wants to give you money, then help them do that.

Speaker 1:          19:50          And if they want to give you status and success, then help them do that. Right? And you do that in part by bringing them solutions and partly you do that by developing your skills. And so if things aren't going very well for you, this is also a good way of evaluating an opportunity. Should you take an opportunity. Well, here's the rule, take the opportunity if it will teach you something that you can use for other opportunities because then even if it fails, which it probably will, it doesn't matter because you've accrued something of value that you can bring forward to the next situation. so you know, there's this old union idea that I told you about the sharp cathedral, for example, the cathedrals made in the form of a cross and the cross signifies the center of the world and the dome signifies the sky and so right below the dome at the center of the world, and it's a cross because the cross is the place of suffering. So that's the center of the world because that's what you are. You're the place of sufferIng, right? You're the place of conscious suffering. that's the center of the world.

Speaker 2:          20:48          And so inscribed on the floor is a maze and you, and it's a big maze and it's a mandela and, and there's a kind of a flower shaped resting place right in the center. And what you're doing is walking in the maze and you walk all four quadrants and you get to the middle, which is where you want to be. You want to be in the middle. Well, how do you get there? You walk everywhere and what does that mean? It means every bloody time you're offered an opportunity, take it and develop your skills. And that's better than wealth by the way, in fact, it actually constitutes wealth because wealth constitutes what you have when someone takes all your money away, right? That's real wealth. And so the way that you build up that sort of wealth is you turn yourself into someone who's competent in multiple directions and you can be doing that all the time, right?

Speaker 2:          21:37          Especially with the kind of technology that you people have access to. I mean, you can learn anything you want whenever you want. So what a good deal that is, man. And so there's, there's easy fruit hanging that you could pick and I would recommend that you do that. So here's an example. Let's say you're not doing too bad, so maybe you're in the middle of the normal distribution, then you lose your job. Okay? And so let's say you're a conscientious person and we can say just for the sake of argument, that you lose your job because of mass layoffs in your company. so it has nothing to do with you. It's fundamentally, it's just like luck Of the draw basically. But then what happens to you? Well, if you're conscientious, you're gonna, you're gonna, go after yourself pretty hard so you're gonna add, especially if you're also high in neuroticism.

Speaker 2:          22:21          It's going to depress you to lose your job and maybe you're in a situation where you just for one reason or another, you don't have that many other opportunities. Now maybe you should look for them, but maybe you're in a depressed strata of the economy or you're geographically located somewhere that makes moving difficult or so on and so forth. You know, so, but you lose a job and then you start to get depressed because of that. Well then as you start to get depressed, you know it decreases the probability that you're going to look for a job, but it also maybe starts to put stress on your family and it also starts to decrease the probability that you're going to engage in positive social interaction. So now not only are you unemployed and suffering from economic stress, but you're married just starting to suffer and you're starting to isolate yourself from your friends.

Speaker 2:          23:02          And then of course, as your marriage suffers in the stress builds up, then that's going to make you more depressed and that's going to keep you even farther away from your friends and that's going to decrease the likelihood that you're going to have enough positive emotion and enthusiasm to look for another job. And then you know, maybe you want to add a bit of a drinking problem too, that just for fun and you can see that you can get a spiral going that's just taken you down. Right? ANd there's all sorts of things because lots of times people conceptualize, let's say, you know, you're unemployed guy and you go to counseling and you get a diagnosis of depression. And the thing about a diagnosis of depression, it's sort of like the assumption is there's something gone wrong with your psychological structure. It's like if you're unemployed and you're, you're depressed, it isn't obvious at all that the problem is in your head.

Speaker 2:          23:47          You know what I mean? It's, it doesn't. If it isn't even obvious that it's a psychological problem, it's just a problem and problems can take you out. And so you know, if you're unemployed and you're under economic stress and your marriage just starting to shake and you're isolating yourself from your friends and you're less likely to be motivated to go look for a job, you can sort of think about that as a depressive spiral, but you can also think of it as a conspiracy in some sense of external forces that are arguing you into the ground and we don't tend to conceptualize psychological disorders that way, but we should because lots of times when people are suffering from something that you could describe in psychological terminology and depression is a very good example of that. it isn't obvious that there's something wrong with them psychologically.

Speaker 2:          24:32          Often they just are in trouble and there isn't a category in psychological diagnosis for client in serious trouble. But my experience has been almost without exception, that the people that come to see me come to see me because something's gone wrong with their life. Not because they have a psychological problem. Now you could say, well, there are psychological inadequacies such as they might be, are interfering with their ability to recover or maybe even served as precursors to, you know, increase the probability of the catastrophe, but it's still not exactly the appropriate way to conceptualize it and you know, because you're, there's you inside you and as a personality psychologist in, as a clinical theorists, most of what I've talked to you guys about is your psyche and its structure as if it was like a soul that inhabited you and, and there's some real utility in that.

Speaker 2:          25:23          You know, you're an individual demarcated from the community. You can be set up in a healthy manner road, not unhealthy manner. The problem with that is that you're not just an individual, you're connected to all these external network dynamic networks that are really, really important and it isn't even easy to separate them from you. You know, like you might say, well this is especially true once you become a parent is like, is your child more you than your arm? You know, you think it's pretty obvious that parts of you that are physically linked. Our more key to you to you as an entity, but it's by no means obvious. I think many people would much more happily sacrifice at arm than a child you know, and so your boundaries are not where your boundaries are located are not precisely isomorphic with the outline of your body.

Speaker 2:          26:07          It's not that simple at all, and so you're embedded in all sorts of networks that can pull you down rapidly or elevate you because the other thing that happens is that, well, let's say I've never traded with anyone and I go up to someone and I say, well, do you want to trade? And they say, well, why? How? How can I trust you? And the answer to that is, well, you have take my word for it with that's not. That's not a very good argument. You might say, instead, well here's what I have to offer and you can evaluate it, but the person's likely to say, well, I don't know how to evaluate it, and so I'm still stuck with taking your word. So that's a bad problem. And you'll see that if ever try to sell a product in the marketplace is if you don't, if if the product is new and it's complex, then you're forcing the person that wants to buy it to evaluate it and then you're forcing them to take the risk of being wrong as well as the time it would take to evaluate it and they don't like that.

Speaker 2:          26:59          WhAt they want is what's often called social proof, which is, okay, well you want to trade with me. Who else have you traded with? And if the answer is zero, then they are going to say, well, you're an interesting person and all that, but I've got these other people over here who've already traded with a bunch of people and therefore the risk is lower in part because let's say I have a supervisor and I'm going to make a decision and my primary concern is that my supervisor will not hate me for making the decision. It's not my that my primary concern is to make the best decision. It's not the same thing. It's that I want to make a decision that I'm not going to get in trouble for, okay, so how do I do that because I need a post hoc justification so I buy something from you and it turns out to be terrible and, and I get called for it, called on the table for it.

Speaker 2:          27:46          And what do I say? I say, well, you know, that person was buying from it and that person was buying from, from, from him and that person was buying from him like all these other people were doing the same thing. So it's not like the error is localized in me and that's often a very credible story. But if the answer is, well, you know, I, I have held you waited, it took, decided to take a risk. It's like out the door with you sunday because you know, that's just, that's an indication that you're not capable of doing that sort of thing. So I think part of the reason that people's spiraled downhill into zero is because po positive feedback, positive feedback loop is a loop that increases the probability that the loop will continue, right? A positive feedback loop is you've experienced this when you hear microphone feedback in an amplified system so you know the microphone sends a message to the speakers and then the speakers send out the message amplified and then the microphone picks up the message and it gets amplified again and you get this howling occur, which is can be deafening but can also destroy the system because it'll keep amplifying upward until the speakers blow, for example.

Speaker 2:          28:51          That'S a positive feedback loop and a positive feedback loop can spiral you upward or it can spiral you downward. And so a virtuous circle, a virtuous positive feedback loop is weird. Well, I've traded with him and I've traded with him and I've traded with him and now I can say to you, I've traded with these three people and you go talk to them and they say good things, and so then you say, well, I'll trade with you, and then because of that, then you're even more likely to trade with me. And it's like the thing starts to spiral uphill and it does that, I think in a nonlinear form. and so because one of the things you guys are going to be asking yourself as you mature, because what's happening is that income inequality is increasing, right? And you might ask, well, why that? Why is that? The first thing you need to know is that that's what income does. So it's not like you need an explanation for it. This is the explanation. It's like a rule. If you run a trading game to its logical conclusion, one person ends up with all the money and everyone else ends up with zero.
