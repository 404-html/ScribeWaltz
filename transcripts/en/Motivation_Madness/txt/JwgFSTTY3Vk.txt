Speaker 1:          00:11          A person's strengths are often their biggest weaknesses into. That also means that their weaknesses can be their strengths. I am weak in all those ways that I listed. I am, but I don't accept that. I don't accept that I am what I am and that that is what I'm doing to be no, I don't accept that. I'm fighting, always fighting. I'm struggling and I'm so hot. Wrapping him, kicking and clawing at those weaknesses, the cheap stock though, some days I win, some days I don't, but each and every day I'd get back up and I move forward with my fist clench toward the battle toward the struggle.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Hey, this temporary, it may last for a minute or an hour or day or even a year. What? Eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however it will last forever. I go dot. Because you feel in the loop, hey, at the end of pain, a success, I fight with everything. I've got to overcome those weaknesses and those shortfalls and those flaws as I strive to be just a little bit better today than I was yesterday. You got the best two jobs in your life, you've got your dream job would. This is only the beginning. This is nothing here. This is not where I want you to be for the rest of your life. Hey

Speaker 2:          03:00          is temporary. I've been trying to get that into your spirit. I've been trying to get you to celebrate. Hey, are you hear me? I'm trying to get you to have an understanding that hey is your friend. The pain is going to take them to the next level. It's not your circumstances or your seat, your whites, it that determines if you're going to be successful up. I've been telling you what's your mindset?

Speaker 1:          03:30          Okay?

Speaker 2:          03:31          Totally. You want to pay. I'm not what you feel it. I know exactly what I've been there. I've done that, but you gotta work through it. Well, on the other side is the reward. Listen to me. Hey, they permanent, no pain, a permanent. You can get through this. You're wiggling your pack. I use the pay to push me to greatness and I'm telling you right now, don't give up. I'm telling you right now, don't get me. Get through it. And if you can get through it, if you can work through your pay, if you can work through your pay, I'm guaranteeing you on the other side. I've got to commit my very being to this thing. I gotta, I gotta breathe it. I got to eat it. I got sleep sweeper and until you get there, you'll never be successful in life. Well, once you get there, I guarantee the world is yours.

Speaker 1:          05:01          Once you make yourself one single mom, it's too self ever. Then you can go watch your life become you actually want it to be. Because the very best for human beings is one that lives in the line. Your thoughts, your words and your actions all as one. Yeah. Not One day saying one thing and then off the next stage, doing something else. Thinking and wishing so badly that you could have something for them only to give up on yourself before you even tried. Plus you have to hope that good things will happen to you when you cannot trust yourself. You can't rely on your own capabilities and the fact that you will show up and do what you said you would. Of course you're going to rely on luck and chance. But if you build up your belief in yourself, keeping the promises that you make to you, your life will change instantly.

Speaker 1:          06:17          I'm not talking about an agreement that you made with somebody else. I'm love talking about a contract and we don't need anybody expecting you to keep your word for somebody else until you have done it for you. Why should anyone else ever believe in you? Why should anyone else ever trust in you? If you cannot trust your son? See the moment that you actually start doing the things that you said you would, the moment you start actually acting on your ideas is the moment your life changes flow ever. It's the moment where you access to power them. Most people never experience in their lifetime. You gained the power to make anything that you want. Anything that you dream of become reality. Because when you follow up your thoughts, when you follow up a dream with real action, well then nothing can stop you. Nothing can get in your way.

Speaker 1:          07:15          Nothing can really take you from your goal and absolutely nobody can take away your goal from you other than yourself is when you don't follow through speed. Don't do the things that you said you would do that other people start to disappear in fail too. We were talking about your dream here. We're talking about your passion. We're not expecting everybody else to show up and give us handouts. You give yourself a handout by following through with actions that you said you needed to do, that you know you needed to do that no will take you to the next level. So stop treating your word like trash. Stop treating it like garbage, like something you could just throw around saying one day that you can improve your relationship. They seem that you're going to be better socially, but saying that you're going to make progress in your career or that you're going to lose weight and get in shape and then the next day not do anything about it and just give up on yourself.

Speaker 1:          08:10          Even if you went half way there. It's the same damn thing. Go all the way followed through with real work, real effort, cause you can keep daydreaming and escaping your dream. You can keep thinking that one day we'll be real or you can actually step into it. Today you can make a real decision. I'm real life position, not a fantasy, a real choice to no longer daydream, but to use your name, to step into your dream. I heard my own trusted you. This no one else can approve of you except for you. You have to validate your dream. You have to validate your passion and you have to validate it with real work and you have to follow with passion. We'll drive determination and all such thing as giving up. How about you stop looking for other people scanning? What's, what's your guarantee success? What's your guarantee about reaching the point where you want to take you seriously? No, seriously stop letting yourself now because there is absolutely nothing, nothing in the world that feels better than doing what you said you would.

Speaker 2:          09:51          Problem is everybody wants to be obese and so it's time to do what real bees do. Everybody gets excited. He t the bull story, but nobody wants to get up at three o'clock. Well, I was excited when I say I wake up at three o'clock three o'clock

Speaker 1:          10:18          hi.

Speaker 2:          10:19          Well you walk out of here, popped up, fire it up. Who get some new information? You're ready? Everybody wants to be a beast. It turns time to do what bees do.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Okay?

Speaker 2:          10:32          What's you have to understand is everybody that you're going to hear from Eric Thomas. My mother got pregnant with me at 17 years old, high school dropout, ate out of trash cans, going to bed and building, slept in cars, multimillion company. That's changing the world. I didn't say America. The world. Why? Because not only do I want to be a beast, if you follow my 24 hours, I do what bees do. You can't just say you want it.

Speaker 1:          11:08          Yes.

Speaker 2:          11:12          Can't watch the video and say I want it as bad as I want to breathe. It's true to say it when the sun comes up, you've got all the books, you've got all the tapes, you got all the access. Now it's time charts.

Speaker 1:          11:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          11:33          I haven't is essentially a decision that your brain made at some point in that you made and then you stop making but continued back. I'm sure you've heard that cheesy quote about life being a journey. Well, it's absolutely you're not racing anywhere. She slow down. Stop looking around at what everyone else is doing and focus on where you are and what's important to you.

Speaker 1:          12:10          Okay.

Speaker 3:          12:12          We know from neurological studies and every habit has three components. There's a cue, which is like a trigger for the behavior to start and then there's the behavior itself and then finally a reward. And for years when people thought about habits, they focused on the VP. But what we know from all of these experiments is that it's the queue and then we'll warm. What are the secrets to unlocking a got understanding how it works and more importantly to change it. How do you gain for assistance and how do you start to have more good days than bad days? You're going to hate this advice, but it absolutely works. You must come up with a morning routine that you do every single morning or at least more and mornings than not. That puts you in control of yourself then in control of your day.

Speaker 1:          13:19          Okay?

Speaker 3:          13:22          We can choose. We can choose to create new habits. We can choose to extinguish old habits. Once you understand how they work according to studies, you get to reshape these automatic behaviors and then you gain this control over these parts of your life that otherwise just feel sort of just at the, just out of reach and foremost, wake up on time when that alarm goes off, get your butt out of bed. Five, four, three, two, one go. Why is that important for persistence? The reason why is because the first decision that you're making of the day is to actually get up and get moving.

Speaker 1:          14:11          Yep.

Speaker 3:          14:11          Means you are persistently bigger than your excuses. You are persistently vigor than feeling lazy, and you are persistently feeding the feelings that typically stop. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:25          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          14:33          Where it is that your two priorities are in your head. Why? The reason why is because of persistence.

Speaker 1:          14:45          Yeah. You got to

Speaker 3:          14:45          start off your day by getting up on time, figuring out your priorities, and then getting to on them. Single biggest reason why people have bad days is because they start them off by looking around at everybody else and seeing what they're doing. Instead of having the focus and the discipline to actually start your day off with you in, in troll,

Speaker 1:          15:17          get out

Speaker 3:          15:18          one time, figure out your priorities and exercise.

Speaker 4:          15:26          You've got to believe in yourself. You've got to believe in your abilities. You got to believe in your service, your company, your ideas. Unquestionably, you must have faith. It's hard. Yes. It's hard. It's difficult. Yes. Blight, and it's worth it.

Speaker 5:          15:54          Okay.
