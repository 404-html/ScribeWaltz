Speaker 1:          00:08          You're doing something for willingly is the fundamental of huge joy, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:14          Hello.

Speaker 1:          00:15          However simpler, stupid, or you'd your Dick Activity. It is. I'm doing something willingly makes a world of difference, isn't it? So

Speaker 2:          00:26          hello,

Speaker 1:          00:28          the difference between Heaven and Hell is just this. You are doing something willingly that you're having. You're doing something unwillingly. That's your hell. We are already taken on attitudes. What we like and what we don't like. I like this person. I don't like this person. Now with this person, I will do things willingly with this person. I'll do things, honey unwillingly. This maybe two people, two aspects of life to communities, to nations, too many things. This I will willingly this I do unwillingly. This means I've decided in my mind this is good. This is bad. When I hear even in national news channels, good guys and bad guys. Once you have this kind of thing, you are going to be disastrous to the planet. It's just a question of time. The moment you decide this is a good person, this is a bad person. This has gone deep into American society. No, there are no good people and bad people. Everybody's oscillating between the two. If you create a wedding, a pleasant, wonderful atmosphere, everybody behaves wonderfully. If you create an unpleasant atmosphere, a whole lot of people agnostic this no, there are joyful people and miserable people, but there are no good people and bad people

Speaker 2:          01:59          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:03          the moment we think we are good, we are entitled to destroy the bad isn't it? Well we've been destroying a lot of people for a long time. Time to stop typing because human beings had in different levels of experience and understanding

Speaker 2:          02:25          that idea of people.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Anybody who is not like you is obviously bad, isn't it? Isn't it? So those are not like me. Must be bad people because the basis of goodness and what you think his goodness is decided by you. No, you have no business to do that. Willing means this. I am just willing, um, 100% yes to life. I am not yes to this one, not to this one. No. I'm just yes and yes to life. If you are 100% a yes to life, you're a woman tier. You have a big, I'm a will in life. You have become sure willing that you have no will of your own.

Speaker 1:          03:15          People ask me Sadhguru, how do you operate with all these people? All kinds of horrible questions. They're asking, they're doing this, they're doing that. I said, my life is not about them. It's about me. It's about how I am. It's about me. It doesn't matter how they are, that's their choice, but how Ireland is my choice. This is my way. No matter what they do. I'm like this because I have not given the freedom to anybody that somebody can freak me, somebody can make me angry, somebody can make me happy, somebody can make me unhappy. These privileges I kept to myself each time you do the too because if somebody else can decide what can happen within you right now, he's in this the ultimate slavery, Huh? Isn't this someone else can decide what should happen within you. What happens around you? Of course him. So many people decide what happens around us is not 100% ours, but what happens within me lesbian, my making, isn't it right now just about anybody can freak anybody because they're not volunteers. They're unwilling. Wallen tiering means you have no will of your own. You can do whatever is needed. You know we are a volunteer organization. This means that all kinds of people, most of them are not qualified for the jobs that they're doing

Speaker 2:          04:48          and I cannot find them because they're all in tears. So people

Speaker 1:          05:00          coming up to me on a daily basis. I said, Google, I can't work with this person. She's so horrible. I gone do it. I tell them, see, in this world, this is the sort of people who exist like this, like this, like this, like this. That's the kind of people that are

Speaker 1:          05:18          not. If you want to work with ideal people, you must go to heaven today, but if you think what you're doing is very significant, you must learn to work with all these horrible people you saw the world is. If you think what you're doing is very significant, you learn to work with all kinds of people. You will see hardly will. People will do wonderful things. Yes, but if you want to work with ideal people, you won't find any. I haven't one yet. No. All kinds of mixed bags. But if you are willing that you are not yes and no as to one north, one of the use, simply one big ass, you will find a way.
