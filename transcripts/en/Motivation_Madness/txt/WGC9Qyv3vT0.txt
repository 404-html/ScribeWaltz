Speaker 1:          00:08          Move on, straight up, move on, forget them. They are lying and they are untrustworthy, so move on. Now, sometimes this can be hard, especially if they've somehow tied themselves into your life, especially like for instance, you get the kids involved in a divorce scenario, you can't move on, but you have to mentally move on. You have to emotionally detach from that human and that's hard to do because obviously they were someone that you trusted and the reason I know that you trusted them is because they got to a point where they were able to betray your trust and destroy you so they they. It's hard, but the fact that they trust that you trusted them, the fact that you had that relationship, that's even more reason to walk away. It's even more reason to move on. You've got to see them for what they are, and this is an important piece right here.

Speaker 1:          01:21          This is an important piece, is something I learned as a young lad out there in the world. That person is not who you thought they were, right? They are not who you thought they were. The idea that this person was a trustworthy, faithful companion is not true. It is not true. That person does not exist. They didn't exist and they don't exist. It was in your head. It was in your head that this person who is trustworthy and you the they were everything you wanted them to be and they were faithful, commanded. That is a lie. They are not that person. They have proved it. They've proved it by their actions, so move on and at the risk of sounding callous, get over it,

Speaker 1:          02:23          get over it. Do not dwell. Do not dwell on to not dwell on on what it was and don't dwell on what it could have been. You. Who are you and guys go through bad breakups. You know it's. I just thought we were going to say no. Don't dwell on that. Deal with what it is right now. What that person is. Deal with reality except reality and be be thankful free album. He thankful that you were able to learn before you invested more into this person. Be Be. Be Thankful that you found out when you did that this person was a liar, that this person was unfaithful, is untrustworthy. Be Be thankful that you know it and you know it now instead of later and you know what else is going to make it a lot easier to get over these situations is recognize that there's plenty of people out there in the world are trustworthy and that our faith, we're good people. They're out there. Go find one of them,

Speaker 2:          03:26          but

Speaker 1:          03:29          don't think that that person that you had was the only one in the world. They're not. And you know what if that as sometimes, sometimes people have a hard time making that trust because they're so caught up and they, they, they don't want to meet someone else right away. That's fine. Start with yourself, right? Rely on yourself. Trust yourself because we want. When someone breaks our trust, we, we, we questioned ourselves too, like we think are my judgments bad. I'm not a good judge of human character because I totally put my faith in this person and look what they did to me. So now we don't trust our. So you've got to build that trust up. You got to build that trust up back again with yourself. How do you do that? Read right? Learn workout, be alone. It's okay to be alone. Some people get freaked out when they're alone. It's okay to be alone. It's okay. It's okay to be alone. There's no big deal. Enjoy it.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Do something productive and build that trust up in yourself. You'll look back at a situation and learn from it. We do that. It's an post operational debrief. Oh, you've put too much trust in somebody. Cool. They broke your heart. All right, Roger that. Let's see. What would the steps, what should I have recognized? How many times did I say will? You know? They didn't call me, but it's probably just because their phone was out of battery. No, once your phone runs out of battery once. Okay. You don't let it happen again. Right? So you start seeing those red flags to you, the mistakes that you made, and then look for them next time around because you deal with people all the time that they made mistakes. The first run, they go back and they make the same mistakes. The second run, they go back and make the same mistakes.

Speaker 1:          05:10          That third rung, that's when you got to start blaming yourself on your situation. That's why. That's why I said you got to like build a relationship with yourself. You gotta learn yourself. You've got to trust. You've got to learn to trust yourself, so spend some time doing that and then when you go back and you start dealing with people, because that's what, that's what you got to watch out for is that you become a hardened criminal. You don't trust anybody like you were talking about cops. You know sometimes cops have a hard time because they're dealing with scumbags all day long and it builds up this, this mistrust of other people. So you don't want to have that happen. You want to be suspicious of people, but you want to be able to build trust once they proved themselves. So take those small steps and start build up

Speaker 3:          05:58          overtime. Don't just jump in and give someone 100 percent trust out of the gate. You don't know him, don't know him. You know, back in the day, back in the day when old hardcore bands used to have this t shirt that just says trust. No one was like, yeah, that's legit. Right? You don't. Don't go out of the gate with the big trust on somebody with important stuff. Don't do it. But the good news is, like I said, there's plenty of people out there that are good people that you give you. Give all your trust to just take it slow brother. Feel crazy how you just explained that. So simple and it makes total sense when you're in the situation though, you know, like you can't just detach it.

Speaker 1:          06:41          Be like, what are the red flags that I didn't know? You're too busy missing the person or whatever, your disaster, but even going and looking at pictures has to work to get out the picture and stare. I've seen guys do that. I'm like, Bro, give me that. Let me throw this away for you. That's not going to help that person. If that. I was always to me was, was explaining like, listen guys, what she was. No, no, she wasn't a. That is a lie, that person that you put put together in your head that you've assembled in your mind, that person doesn't exist. They don't exist. The person that you dealt with was a liar, was unfaithful, was a cheater. That's the person, the person who wasn't this person that you're putting forth in your mind. That person doesn't exist, so stop, but you don't understand the good time. Yeah, I know. I know. I know.

Speaker 3:          07:38          Here's the trick. Okay, so if. Okay, that person will lie. That part of the cheater and what I kind of said there was like you don't understand the good time. That's a real part of it. That's really it. It's like, sure they did this. Sure. She. I'm a flats. My tires when she gets measured, all that, but the good times we have are so good. So it's. It's, it's proof that it. It's not about the person. It's not about the person that you can see all the red flags and how they mistreat you from time to time or they you. It's about yourself and how you're sad now because of all these reasons, but the trick comes with what one of the tricks come with. Um, same thing I said about drinking where it's your brain because it's like chemicals when you bond with someone in certain in certain ways.

Speaker 3:          08:18          And it's different from, you know, it varies from person to person, but it's like, I think it's like oxytocin or I don't know, something where it's, it's it, but yeah, it's going to. But you feel this bond with this specific person. That's why you have these feelings. Even though this girl like lies to you, you see her lying text messages on your phone right now. You're looking at him. Meanwhile, you still, men still miss him. It's a trick because it seemed like that your emotional wellbeing is attached to this person kind of thing. Right? And all the other stuff, you just kind of ignore it. So it just like, I'm the same with drinking, right? Why know? Consciously like, I'm going to be hung over tomorrow. I get anything done, all this stuff. Why do I want to drink so bad right now? You know, kind of thing and it's the same thing.

Speaker 3:          09:02          The chemicals in your brain are telling you like this girl is essential for you. You know, for your wellbeing is not yet. Oh, that's the logic though. That's a lie. It's a tricky. Listen to that. Don't listen to your brain. Listen to me that she's not essential. That's all you bro. I'm telling you. But that's the logic. Those chemicals are blocking. I have seen so many situations where guys are just in. What's horrible is I'm sitting here saying this, it's. You could be smacking someone in the face telling them, move on, move on, and they're not to listen to that too. So you gotta make that decision. Yeah, that's, that's, that's it's hard. And guys ruined their lives. I mean the oldest due to the girls and guys, they ruined their lives, you know, with over somebody that is completely abusive, whether mentally or physically that just completely abusive and they'll ruin their lives for this person.

Speaker 3:          09:51          That per se, in my mind, I think it's because they build a person, they build a person on the framework of reality. They build a fantasy and they're in love with that fantasy and they want to keep it going. Right? It's a fantasy. So stop and they get away ignore like all the quona version for sure, and they remember the good times. Even if it's like like 10 minutes a week, they remember those good times. They ignore the red flags because of that, that you know that trick, that chemical trick in their brain and so it reinforces that thing that they built. You know, that fantasy that they built there. It's true, this big. The reality is this big and look the street and they just attached to it. You ever see a friend or whatever because I'm assuming you're in, you've never been in this situation like you ever had a friend where they're really into it.

Speaker 3:          10:42          They're almost ruining their life. They're in bad shape or whatever, and then whether it be all of a sudden or years later, whatever they're thinking back in, they're like, whoa. Was. I think because the chemical trick so to speak, wears off, and then they can see all of that logic that you're talking about. You're like, oh my gosh, man, it's, it's almost like, it's almost like you feel like you were a different person when you recover your kids. I mean, just the fact that you can't talk any sense into people when they're in that situation is the trick. You got to try and. Yeah, it's hard. It's hard, but I think knowing that that's it. It's a chemical in your brain that is tricking you and it goes for a lot of stuff. Donuts, like all this that's tricking you. If you know like, Hey, and you say, I'm not going to be tricked. I feel it. I feel this. I feel the sadness. I feel missing this person, but it's a trick, you know? Yeah, it helps. It totally helps. I like it. So move on, man. I know it's hard. Trust us. Speaking of moving on, next question, unless we want to talk about this anymore. No, I think you're ready to move on. Exactly right. Let's move on.

Speaker 3:          11:53          In what circumstances

Speaker 1:          11:54          do you recommend direct? I will hold on. Oh, we're not going to be stuck on, but what's horrible is been people killed themselves in these situations over a lie. Yeah, that's, that's me. That's the trick, but it's a lie in guys or girls get so distraught over this fantasy that doesn't exist and what's really jacked up is if they could just move on, they'd find a reality that was actually congruent with what their desires are. It's out there. You can see people all over the world. They're there, they're in relationships. I having fun from every level, right? There's someone out there, but you, you get caught up in this mental trap and, and obsessing over a fantasy. It's a fantasy. Don't, don't, don't obsess over the fantasy, man. There's, you can, you can get over it and there's plenty of other human beings out there that are awesome. So go find one of them, and in the meantime, hang out with your Badass self, right? Become a better person and working out is a big one for sure. For sure. That's it. That's the 100 percent. Just get, get into the gym and get after it. Jujitsu solves everything. Yes, lifting solves everyday.
