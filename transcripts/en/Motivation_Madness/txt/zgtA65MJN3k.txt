Speaker 1:          00:46          Their destiny will never be reached if you don't depart, you must never stopped. Understand the work. Concrete does not voluntarily admit the obstacles that are to come, but simply allows you to chance to greet them yourself. You will feel as though you are blindly running through life, but asked you to close your eyes and trust your mind. Trust your body, trust her spirit, trust you. Your future is simply a vision of the paradise you have created in your mind. You must venture into the unknown with the acceptance that everything you go through, we'll have a purpose. Purpose, to learn, purpose, to change, a purpose, to create. You see, we're all here on this planet for a specific reason. We must find it. Define it and never stopped believing in our destiny because life has no meaning until you create it. It is the obstacle that we overcome that grant us the true beauty and life, the beauty that confirms that everything that you have ever struggled for, it was worth it. If you find trust in your faith and what the universe has for you, you will find what you have always been looking for because life is not about the destination. It's about the journey.
