Speaker 1:          00:00          What is it that gives your life a sense of meaning and purpose? Because once you find that,

Speaker 1:          00:07          it puts you in your power place. See if you know what your life work is. I encourage you to start working on it. If you can't do it all at one time, do just a little bit of it and if you don't know what it is that you showed up to do, if you don't know why you're here, I encourage you to find out what your purpose is here. What is the meaning of your life? What will be different? Have you ever asked yourself that question? I've done that. I, I remember coming from a friend of mine's funeral and I was reflecting on how much time I had left and I went for a walk in the park thinking about this guy whose life was so promising and I mean he wasn't an old guy who was quite young in fact, and I thought about all of the things that he said he was going to do and he never got a chance to do those things.

Speaker 1:          00:57          And I start thinking about my own life and how much time I had left to do the things that I would like to do. And at that time I wasn't sure what my life purpose was, what my life's work was. I wasn't sure about it at that time and I thought about it quite a lot. I had some idea, but I wasn't convinced that I don't think I felt worthy. I didn't believe that it could be me to do this kind of work that I'm doing right now. And I say to you that if you began to take a conscious effort to find out what it is and you're supposed to do, I say that it can literally save your life. I said that it can literally save your life. 80 five percent of the American public. I caught him to recent studies are going to jobs that they hate working on jobs that do not challenge them. They get sick. Thinking about going. Because see, when you go to a job and you already know how far you can go, you can already see that proverbial glass ceiling. See, when you're going someplace and you already know how much you're going to make, you already know how far you can go. You're in a dead end position. It erodes your self esteem. It lowers your sense of yourself. It creates an inner turmoil. It creates an emptiness in you. Say That your life is worth finding what it is that you're supposed to do,

Speaker 1:          02:42          and I'm not saying quit your job. I'm saying find it to do just a little bit on just on working at it just a little bit, but do find out what your work is and hold onto it and don't let your dream go. Don't let it go. See, and here's something else I want you to begin to look at. Why is it that most people don't pursue their dreams that don't do better than what they're doing? If they're capable of doing it? I think that many of us don't go the next step because we don't know what to do yet, and I say that, that the reason that we don't even explore the possibility of what to do is because subconsciously we don't believe that it can happen for us and we don't believe that we deserve it. So here's what I'm suggesting. How much time do you spend working on you? How much time do you spend every day working on your dream and the last 90 days, how many books have you read and the last year, what new skill or knowledge have you acquired? What kind of investment have you made in you?

Speaker 1:          03:54          So I'm saying that as you begin to look at where you want to go, if you want to make it today and things are changing so fast, you have to literally run to stand still. I'm saying that you've got to make some conscious effort to begin to work to develop you. Here's something else. Most people are not living their dreams because of fear. Ladies and gentlemen, fear limited vision and lack of self esteem is what keeps most people doing things. They don't want to do. The same reason that people stay in relationships where they abuse or they're unhappy or it's unfulfilling. They can't see themselves beyond that relationship. They can't see themselves enjoying life without that person. They think that this has all been. They can do the same reason that people get stuck at a certain level in life. They can't see things being better for them and they think that this is, and this is all they deserve. This is all they've ever seen. It's been passed onto them and they fade with this is it for them. Oh No. I'll look in what Dr Blanton Smiley Blanton, who is a colleague of Dr Norman Vincent Peale, what he said about theories that fear is the most subtle and destructive of all human diseases. Ladies and gentlemen, fear kills dreams. Fear kills hope. Fear what people in the hospital fear can age you. Fair Ladies and gentlemen can hold you back from doing something that you know within yourself that you are capable of doing, but it will paralyze you

Speaker 1:          05:35          and it seems like you're in a hypnotic spell and I asked you a question. What is the benefit? What's the benefit of allowing fear to hold you back? What's the benefit of giving up on yourself? I'm not stepping out on life and taking life on what is the benefit for you? What's The plus in that?

Speaker 2:          05:57          So

Speaker 1:          05:58          one of the things I had to ask myself, so I didn't want to make any mistakes. I wanted everybody to like me. I want it to be perfect. The first time I did something. It's not gonna happen. You're gonna. Make some mistakes. You're going to hurt some folks, feel it. You're going to create some enemies whenever you decide that you want to begin to take life on, you got to ask yourself, how long am I going to allow this to hold me back? I like what Zig Ziglar says. He said, fear is false evidence appearing real.

Speaker 1:          06:31          That is the illusion that we create in our mind. It is a state of mind that can be changed, so let's look at how we can begin to take some steps to restructure that fear, to begin to expand our visions of ourselves to begin to increase our self esteem. Webster said that self esteem means competence and satisfaction in one self. Look at your life right now. Whatever you've done up to this point in time, your life is working. Whatever you have produced it came out of you as result of the kind of person that you have become as a result of your choices, as a result of your consciousness. Now you have to ask yourself, are you satisfied with what you had produced? Is this what you want? Would you like things to be better than this? Do you believe that you deserve better than this? Aren't you content? This is it. You don't have to do everything. Anything else that you already with Zan yourself in life and said, well, I'm happy I'm not starving like the people in Calcutta. Are you allowing yourself to get off the hook like that or do you believe somewhere in the back of your mind or in your heart that there are some other great work for you to do this, something else that has me you, and that's why you are here?

Speaker 1:          07:48          How do we handle this fear factor? How do we increase our self esteem? You have to begin to fortify yourself. How do we do that? I believe that you have to begin to consciously monitor your inner conversation and start talking to yourself. Start building yourself up. Sometimes the only good things you will hear about you, other things that you say to you. I'm saying, learn to be your own booster. Start building yourself up. Start encouraging yourself. Start saying, I can do this. I can make this happen. When I started thinking about becoming a speaker, I said, yes, I can do this. I can make this happen. When I stopped trying to convince myself I can be a businessman after flopping and failing and losing thousands of dollars and feeling stupid and dumb and having people take advantage of me because of what I did know, I had to talk to myself because people were saying to me that I was dumb and somewhere in the back of my mind I was saying, you're right.

Speaker 1:          08:45          Look at what I've done. I had to say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, hey. Come on man. Get your stuff together. You can handle this. You just haven't figured out yet. It's all right. This is your training theory. This is tuition. You have to pay for what you don't know you can do this other people have done it. Doesn't take an Einstein. Get you some people that can teach you some stuff that you don't go get you some people that have done it successfully and learn from them. Take some seminars, workshop. Read some books on how to manage your business, changed the way you see yourself and begin to attend to the personal details. Understand that nobody's gonna take care of your business better than you,

Speaker 1:          09:26          and when I started changing that kind of mindset of beating myself up because of my mistakes, and start looking at the possibility of my doing better of my making, the adjustments that would have enabled me to do what I want to do successfully, things began to change. I say stopped beating up on yourself. You do do it. I know you're doing it. I've done it. It's a natural inclination for us to put ourselves down. See, we're born negative. I think in a negative consciousness because we live in a negative world. Here's some other things. Ladies and gentlemen, begin to guard your mind against negative programming like turn off the television. Don't watch the news so you've got the God the kinds of things that you put in your mind. See, if you don't program your mind, your mind will be programmed because human beings are goal oriented.

Speaker 1:          10:15          That's why we die of broken hearts early. That's why we're running through life to early grades. We're going through life, ladies and gentlemen, and I think that Henry David Thoreau said that most men live in quiet desperation. Most of us go through life running scared, so we had created this in our mind is false evidence appearing real? We made it real in our minds. That's why Churchill said, there's nothing to fear but fear itself, that's the disruptive monster. So turn off things that can contribute to your fear. Turn a deaf ear to people that all they can do is talk about how negative things are because they have bought into the consciousness of the world. Start attending workshops, seminars, listening to tapes on a daily basis to begin to recondition your mind, to retrain your thinking. Faith comes by what hearing and hearing and hearing, listening to things that could empower you, that can enable you to create a new reality for yourself in a new life for yourself. You might appear to be strange around most people you know. Most people think you're strange. If you're happy today, say these people have not found their purpose in life. That's why they are grumpy, but that's why they're miserable. That's why they're so negative, they're hurting and they want to hurt other people.

Speaker 1:          11:35          So start practicing using programs for your mind, seminars, books, workshops. Keep a journal. Record your thoughts, what's happening with you everyday when you get up, have a journal near you. See, ladies and gentlemen, we get three to four thoughts a year that if we would act on those thoughts, hey can change I ally. What I did are you setting on write your ideas down and then once you get that idea, take the lead. Take the lead out here in the universe. If you don't take the pledge, I guarantee you somebody else will take the plunge. Go into action, and ladies and gentlemen, you will be surprised at how things will come together. You'll be surprised. Now you're going to have some difficult challenges. I can tell you that now. Be aware of that. Things are not going to work out exactly right for time. They will sometimes, and that's when life is just playing the game with you.

Speaker 1:          12:36          I want you to feel good and relaxed, but ladies and gentlemen, go into action with your dream and don't avoid where the fights are. Get in the midst of the fight. Get knocked down so you can learn how to fight so you can hold your position. Say, most people don't get out in the arena of life because they don't want to fight. Most people don't get out of there because they don't want to get knocked down. They don't want to be dropped to their knees, but say you're going to be dropped. Whether you on the field or where they're not just sitting on the sidelines, you're going to be dropped, so at least get dropped with something. See, that's not most people are spectators in life. You don't want to be a spectator. You want to get out in the field where the action is and you will be amazed after the struggle, there will be a calm period and it began to click for you.
