Speaker 1:          00:08          Be Open to experience, be willing to try new things. Don't have a rigid plan except random acts of hospitality without judgment or fear. Don't be afraid to wander. Don't be afraid to eat a bad meal. You know, if you don't risk the Bab Neil, you'll never get the magical one, but are the most important to be humble. Be grateful. Be Aware of the fact that you are probably the stupidest person in the room as far as you were the least prepared, at least equipped person to know who's really in charge of what's really going on. I think I made maybe before I started traveling, I thought that the human race as a whole or you know, could, could and would turn on itself at any moment. You know, Venal petty, cruel, arbitrary, and it's true with all of those things exist in this world, but I need mostly pretty nice people doing the best they can. Often under very, very difficult conditions. I met a lot of very nice people who've done very, very bad things that conflict with my deeply held conceptions of justice or sexual equality or acceptable practice or religious views.

Speaker 2:          01:24          Um,

Speaker 1:          01:26          a lot of gray areas in travel, um, but I think that on balance the world is filled with people doing the best they can, you know, we love their kids and you know, would like to, you know, put on a clean shirt every morning and live their lives in the little dignity and have access to food and water.

Speaker 2:          01:49          Hope. I'm

Speaker 1:          01:52          just like everybody else. Uninhibited. Creative freedom is something that I've been incredibly fortunate to have for the better part of my entire television career. Unlike anyone else I know of in television. I've been free to do whatever I want to make the shows I want, anywhere I want, with whom I want it in any style I want. So I, at first I don't know any other way and by now I won't have it any other way. Life is good. Why settle for less? And by the same token, when you're given that much freedom and you're, you have essentially no interference, nothing but support behind you. Um, what you don't want to do is get lazy and bored and sloppy. To me, I'd much rather not make tv at all or make even unsuccessful tv that make competent television. You know, it's very easy to make a conventional travel or food show at this point.

Speaker 1:          03:05          It's, it's like shooting corn. It's the same shot sequence at the same sort of limited a terminology. Uh, you know, how all of their little pieces work where you have to start and where you have to add. Um, I detest competent workman like storytelling and I'm always very, you know, the Times that we, we, we do that. I'm, I'm very unhappy with that. I'd rather I'd rather fail. Now. I've been fired many times by in my cooking career. Uh, I've been fired a number of times. I was not a particularly good chef. I had a lot of problems at various points in my career with narcotics.

Speaker 2:          03:47          Um,

Speaker 1:          03:49          I was very deservedly a fired on a number of occasions.

Speaker 2:          03:53          Um,

Speaker 1:          03:57          but I mean if you're talking about failure, you know, I accepted failure as a chef because I was at various times a bad chef or even a bad person these days. If I fail, it's because I tried to do something and did not succeed or I, I just was not able to do, uh, what I hope to do or wanted to do. Or maybe I tried to do something that is clearly in retrospect didn't work, but I would much rather than that I would much rather fail gloriously then not venture, not try.

Speaker 1:          04:47          I'm not in, as I said before, I'm not interested in, in competent making, telling, telling stories with, with competence. I'm looking at them with some style and originality and some creativity that is interesting to me and the people I work with and there have been times that, that, that has resulted in failure, a beating. It didn't work. It didn't communicate anything like what I wanted to. Often the story I think I'm going to get ends up being another story entirely that's even better. We're very different. That's good. But there are other times where I just failed miserably, you know, I tried to do with cecily shell again and it was not good. It did not capture the place. It did not, didn't show us anything of value. It, it did not live up to its subtlety and beauty of its subject. Um, and then there are, there are shows where some people are just going to hate it. They just don't like the style. They think it's self indulgent. They don't get it. But that's kind of failure. I like

Speaker 2:          06:01          no,

Speaker 1:          06:04          a powerful reaction one way or the other, uh, infinitely preferable to me than pleasing everybody. If you, if every. If I walk into a room where everybody agrees with me, I find that frightening and dismayed and pouring. It's fucking my answer. That question stems from my history is an addict. I'm a lot of other addicts look in the mirror every day and did not see somebody worth saving. Even at my worst, there was a level of vanity. I guess I look in the mirror and saw somebody who, somebody deep in there, regardless of how low I was, my circumstances, I had a high enough opinion of myself that I thought,

Speaker 2:          06:49          um,

Speaker 1:          06:52          it's worth going forward. I think a lot of people in a similar situation for whatever reason, look in the mirror and see somebody unworthy of good things and allow themselves or excuse a downward spiral because they don't really believe in their basic work I did. You know? So that's vanity. I think it's the same drive that allows me to tell stories in books and on tv because let's face it, anybody who writes a book or ged with the notion that they have a story worth telling that people might want to listen to. You're really already by definition now as sort of an aberrant personality and a monster of self regard. This is a very reasonable attitude. I have a unique, I have a story that you will want to listen to for 10 minutes. Why would any reasonable? And I might make a living doing that. So you might even want to pay for that story. To the point that I could make a living doing that rather than washing dishes or, or, or preparing meals that's not normal. That takes something and I don't know whether that's, you know, that's often a very much at odds with, with, you know, being a functioning well rounded good person in the conventional sense, uh, that kind of vanity and narcissism, self regard, self importance and cheerful willingness to examine your and share your feelings.

Speaker 2:          08:35          No,

Speaker 1:          08:37          I think Fran Liebowitz said at one point, you know, you know, if you're, if you're sharing your feelings, you don't need that. It's not sharing that's leaking. When that book came out, it was immediately a best seller and it changed my life overnight. Overnight. I was desperately and debt hadn't paid my rent on time. Ever had owed Amex for 10 years without making a single payment owed. The irs hadn't even filed, was in very, very, very insecure place. At Age 44. Suddenly people were offering me things, offering the opportunities. I think if I did, I was old enough and I fucked up enough already that I just said, you know, I realize this is a lucky break, was unlikely to get another, so I'd be very careful. Choices in that environment was very determined to not fuck up. Oh, I didn't go for easy money. I didn't grab the first thing. I did not give food, network the show they wanted and I said no a lot. So what seemed like a lot of money. Well look what's good for you in the short run is not necessarily good for you in the long run.

Speaker 1:          10:08          You know you're starting out as a writer. You've written one book and somebody got a TV show and somebody offers you a million dollars to represent that antidiarrhea medication. Well, that's a lot of money in the short run, but you're always going to be that guy with the shits. I'm admittedly, I'm a very contradictory impulses here. I'm, I'm old school and a lot of ways I think you should at least know how to make beef Bourguignon correctly according to the original recipe. To the degree that anything can be authentic, uh, you should know how to, you know, some dishes to me, like a conduit or a traditional Italian pastas. I get really pissy if people riff on them, you know, you put chicken in a carbon, are you lost me, it's unforgivable sin against God. But on the other hand, you know,

Speaker 1:          11:11          you know, the guys who came out of Blues and R and B, uh, who turned out to be Jimi Hendrix, you know, there are people who can riff on and improvise on classics and create whole new, wonderful worlds. And what is authentic is mostly meaning the city. When the tomato is not authentic Italian and it came from the new world of Chinese food is always evolving. So it was protective. It instinctively hostile to new as I can be a. I know too many really creative chefs and I understand the changing world. Is it pleasurable, I guess is the benchmark for the. If you're going to mess with a classic, are you making something more dazzling that says, look at me and how smart I am? Or are you in some way improving? It is it pleasurable? Is it chicken Caesar more pleasurable than a plain Cesar?

Speaker 1:          12:08          I think not. I think the chicken takes away, but that's my opinion. I'm relentlessly, pathologically a punctual, I think. I think that comes from all those years as a chef that is a, more importantly, as a cook, you know, can you showed up late as a cook? You're letting your people down in a very tangible way. Somebody else has to physically do the work, do the setup, or you lose the shift or you get fired as a chef cooks and showed up late who are disorganized. You couldn't keep a lot of stuff going on in their heads. They failed and when they fail, we all went down with them. So I am a relentlessly, you know, possibly either unhealthfully, you know, anal retentive, uh, you know, obsessive compulsive, uh, you know, cleaning up after my, when I'm cooking, I'm cleaning up after myself constantly. I keep things organized.

Speaker 1:          13:03          I write lists, I keep my schedule up to date. I am never late. And as part of that, if I say to you, I'm going to meet you tomorrow at 12 minutes after five to see John Wick seven, uh, I will be there at five. Oh, two hanging out across the street, discreetly observing to see what time you show up and I'll be making some very important decisions based on your arrival time. It's a curse and a blessing. But I think everything important I ever learned, I learned that I learned as a, as a, as a dishwasher and as a cook, a, you show up on time, you organize, you get, you know, you stay organized and clean up after yourself or you think about the people you work with. You respect the people you work with. Um, and like I said, you do the best you can.
