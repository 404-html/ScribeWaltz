Speaker 1:          00:14          A messenger of Satan to buffet me less. I should be exalted above measure. I want to talk to you from the subject sparring partner. You know what a sparring partner is. It's somebody that you box with in preparation for a fight, and if you are a fighter, a sparring partner is a gift because if you don't have a sparring partner, you won't be ready for the real fight. But as foreign partner may hitch made hurts, made challenge. Just because you got hit doesn't mean it was the devil.

Speaker 1:          01:16          I want to pray. Let me let me and then I've jumped on it. Hose figured out. Thank you for this opportunity to share the word and speak to your people today. I thank you for what to keep Matt Tracer, which again, I respect what she gave out on her. When you get me, I'm blessed because he said anything to me. Give me the ability to articulate effectively what you have shared with me in such a profound, at that didactic way, the people's lives are better because they have shared this moment with Uli. Speak Lord for that servant heareth in Jesus' name. Amen. You may be seated.

Speaker 1:          02:01          So I went to the movies the other day and uh, I went to see cream. I know I'm late, but I went to see Craig, you know, with Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan and it, and, and, and it was really, really, it was really, to me, it was a great movie, just unbelievable movie, but the movie's scissors around a young man with potential and trying to get semesters stallone's character to train him to continue the excellence and the legacy of his predecessor, his father. In the process of training, he is facing a daunting task of being trained in adverse environments so that when he gets to the stage, nothing that is thrown at him, we'll toss him away from the victory, but will enable him to accomplish what he was set out to do. I wanted to bring it up because I thought of it when I read what Paul wrote because Paul is coming to the end of a summarization of how blessed he is, how much God has done for him, the depth of revelation that he has and how much God has spoken into his life.

Speaker 1:          03:28          And right on the heels of a dissertation about whether in the body or in the spirit. I cannot tell us. I knew a man who saw things that were not lawful to be uttered and mostly alone. Just think that he actually is referring to himself, but to cast the light off of himself. He speaks in third person. But in reality he's saying the abundance revelation was given to me. It was given to me. Look at the abundance that was given to you. I was ministering to somebody the other day and it was a young man kind of depressed over his relationship with his father. And when I begin to talk to him, I said, you talk to me about what you don't have, but you say nothing about what she's doing. Look at the infrastructure that God put all around you to subsidize and replace what you didn't get.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Look at all the people who love and feed and care for you, and maybe we will never be your father, but we, we represent the sum total of God's commitment to get love to you. Even if he had to bring it in another way. And when I got to tell him all of his assets, it balanced against his liability. See, life is a combination of assets and liabilities. And we see and we want, and we crave the assets, but we are not prepared for the liabilities. Every advancement will cost you everything you've accomplished. You pay the price for it, for every accomplishment that exist in your life. And every victory and every revelation and every, uh, economic blessing, every kind of physical blessing, every type of emotional blessing there. There's always something that balances it out, lets you be exalted above measure. I want you to understand that it is not just God.

Speaker 1:          05:25          When the blessing comes, it is also God. When the buffet or the enemy cubs, Paul says, this was a gift to me, a messenger of Satan take with me a messenger of Satan was a Gif to me. My problem, and everybody's got one. Everybody's got something to kick. Kick. Everybody's got something. You be, everybody's got something that you struggle with, it let you wrestle with. It can be insecurity and can be an intimidation. It could be. Fear is, it'd be about, it can be low self esteem. It could be anger, it could be everybody has their uniquely designed devil, but Paul says, this was given to me. Why wouldn't God gives you or sin a messenger of say the first of all, let me stop there and talk about how I'm glad to know that if he access me, God had to allow it.

Speaker 2:          06:34          Okay?

Speaker 1:          06:35          The good news is he couldn't just come at me all his old, the very fact that he came at me, men that he had to get permission to get near it. Now that's good for me because it lets me know that God is in control, that the devil has not been able to do whatever he wanted to do in my life, but I live in a controlled environment and soda. You are controlled environment, a controlled environment. God controls how hot it gets, how cold it gets, how much suffering you go through, how many blessings you have. He control. You will not let allow your haters, your [inaudible], your lace, eight years to get their hands on the control switch of your life. If it I accessed you, be it good or bad, right or wrong, up or down, evil or card. If it got to you at all, it had to have permission because you are kept.

Speaker 2:          07:47          Oh, you are?

Speaker 1:          07:53          Look at some ads up and kept. I been, I been framed it. I, I, I'm a gated community. You can't just drive up on me. You have to ring a bell and get permission. I'm David. I got boundaries. I got walls around me. Don't you remember how when in the book of job does, the Bible said when the subject, God came around the throat, a Muslim came Satan and he said, where have you been trading going to and fro, in and out throughout the earth. And God said, have you considered my servant job? And say, they said, now you know you got a hedge around. Do you not know all the sisters? My sisters make some noise.

Speaker 1:          08:43          All the to tell somebody I'm going kep lover. I'm a kept woman. He got fences around me. He's got various around his trophy wife. I've reserve well taken care of. He opens doors. He makes ways he controls who comes in, who goes out. I'm a kept woman. What my brothers at make some noise. He's keeping me too. He kept the gun from board off. He kept the car from crashing. He kept me from losing my mind. He kept me from throwing in the towel. He kept me from being locked up in a jail cell. He kept it from being at this stage and age in my life. I wouldn't be here right now if God hadn't kept me,

Speaker 1:          09:32          I no, but whatever access this lead has to give permission because I know I look gay. Community. I'm a gated community. You can't just walk up on this trade. Just walk trouble. Jane's doing sickness. Can't do it. The Preston kid blew it. Fear of kate do it. You can't just walk up on this property. This is God's property from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet. This is God's property. In fact, if you 5 million, not even the Mama lists the Lord because I'm Kevin. If the enemy comes, he has to have permission to do it and Paul says, it was given to me a messenger of Satan, thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me. If God says the Messenger of Satan to buffet me, whatever he is trying to do in my life is bigger than what he use to buffer it. Lead I am saying the big tree, then it's not in. Getting rid of the for the colon is a blessing to keep you from some enemy that is worse than the corn. The thorn is how God treats you to balance you, to stop you from getting too impressed with yourself.

Speaker 1:          11:35          He's an to bless you so that if I didn't break you anywhere, the blessing would go so far in your head that you would give besides yourself, because I hate pride above everything else in the world. Yet I want to bless you. I'm going to bless you, but to stop you from being proud of yourself. I'm going to give you something that makes you drop your head.

Speaker 1:          12:07          I want to talk to you this morning about the thing that makes you drop your head. When people compliment you, the thing that stops you from really taking it all live, something that you know about yourself, realize about yourself, some deficiency, some area of brokenness in your life that humbles you may not be spiritual warfare. It may in fact be a gift from God to control your character, to give you common control, to stop you from being judgmental about other people, to get rid of your arrogant demeanor. God will send a messenger from Satan to buffet your flesh.

Speaker 1:          12:52          Who in the world would think that the apostle Paul, who was healing the sick and raising the dead and writing most of the epistles for the New Testament church, the Bible sees he was getting beat up all the time, getting beat up, writing, preaching, laying hands, healing the sick, raising the dead, but secretly, secretly, somewhere in your life. You can punch right now somewhere in your life. You're getting hit right now somewhere in your life. You're up under attack right now. Have some of you think the victory is stop the attack, but the Lord gave me a message this morning to tell you that the attack is your blessing. I'm going to mess with you that I'm a mess with here today. I'll go left. Tell your neighbor the attack is my blessing. Yeah. I want you to see that it was sent to buffet me.

Speaker 1:          14:06          The word buffet means to be big lift fist, something big shoe. With this I never will forget. It was probably the highlight. I don't know if I should say that. It seems like one of the highlights of my life and ministry church was exploding. Muslim ministry was exploding, going five servers. Oh, Sunday. Here, people getting saved. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people getting saved every week. Thousands more over the television. People get healed. People being delivered, people coming out of crutches and wheelchairs and getting touched by the power of the Holy Ghost. Casting demons out of witches, screaming and hollering and yelling, running out the door, rebuke in the powers of the enemy. They tried to curse me. There's frequent chicken blood out in front of the building. Y'All remember what I'm talking about? We rebuke. The trick is I remember standing in an old church and I told them they should have fried them chickens.

Speaker 2:          15:11          The bands top off shit that toe. Hallelujah.

Speaker 1:          15:20          Yeah, the the, the trick of blood everywhere. I told her to shut a fried them. I went to Babson over top of him and check right old preaching

Speaker 1:          15:29          and that was amazing. It was amazing. Every time you turned on the TV set it was when the show opened up. Get Ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready. It was amazing, but when I came home, my mother in law died and before I could get over it, my mother developed Alzheimer's and so in between the get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready. I was coming home trying to get her to swallow, to remember love to whole food in her mouth and then having to clean the food out of her mouth with my hand. I remember vividly, vividly a great anointing service we had over here. I was running my own robot. I was running my own revives people were all backed up on the highway to come to the providers. I remember one service is the holy ghost move. People would get healed and delivered. I left here, I ran him to the hospital, wet, wet with sweat cloud low top of my mother's bed and told God to heal her. How could I be this powerful?

Speaker 1:          16:56          How could I call fly up down from a habit over here and come over here and whole somebody who's truly with it? Wow. Everything else. What's going on? Number one, we need economic support and supporting. The Bible says if we don't support economically, we are less than an infidel that we need to provide, but we also understand now that this support is more than money. So we want to talk about number two, we want to talk about social support. We want to talk about your social support around you, your family, your, your family needs social support. Does it have support? Everything in this room needs support, support. That gets a little boring, but it's very important. You came in, you saw the carpet and you didn't see the concrete, but the carpet means nothing without the concrete support. Have you gotten support around you for what you're trying to do? You're trying to build a career, do you have support? You've been telling God you're ready for the next level. Is Your family wedding? Have you built it a love support to support you getting ready to run for Congress can have your kids handle it?

Speaker 1:          18:07          Have they got the right kind of friends and support, but he surrounded this wife had the right support for your next move. This is why God has given you this at the first of the year because you're getting ready to go to another level

Speaker 3:          18:21          and for the level that you can read it and horn. You can't take old support and to new levels for the level that you're getting rid of the coin. You're going to need some social support to undergird you. It's not enough to have the vision and have the dream if you don't have the support and it's not just about you. It's about everything that's connected to you. You want to build a great work for God, but can the kids handle it? Is it the right time, the right season? Do they have friends around them that support your phone use or are you the only sane voice in the life of your family?

Speaker 1:          19:00          So what number two, we got to have social support. What? I'll give you a couple of things I have learned in life. The higher you go, the smaller your circle.

Speaker 3:          19:11          People who've got all kind of friends, they know everybody and they run them up. All kind of the people.

Speaker 1:          19:16          I ain't going very high

Speaker 3:          19:19          because if you get too big of a circle, you're going to have to stay low. If you're going to be like a pyramid and come up, the higher you get, the smaller your circle. Now to take the permit and turn it upside down and the soul gets bigger as it goes up, it's going to fall over. That means you can't take everybody with you. You gotta be careful who you're trying to take with you. The higher you go, the more discriminating you have to be and who you got to give your time too because we now understand that provision is blocked just money. It's attention, it's time, it's interest, it's affection, nothing that you have, we'll run right without you. So everything that you have requires more of you and you can afford to fund every situation you. Oh, it's not that they're not good people. It's just said that you are a limited resource and some of you are wore out now cause you aren't too many things to too many people. You got to bring your circle for work. God is getting ready to take you to,

Speaker 2:          20:30          yeah,

Speaker 3:          20:31          high five somebody said, Lord, that man is talking in the mood.

Speaker 1:          20:40          The third area that you need is spiritual support. Maybe he'd come home and support. You need social support, your social environment. You need spiritual support. Let me tell you why you need spiritual support because when you let me tell you something until you let me tell you, you would continue. Who can I tell every family is dysfunctional in some way?

Speaker 3:          21:16          Maybe they would believe that they believe it. They didn't believe me. Someone who,

Speaker 1:          21:22          but the frustration that we hear, we always think everybody got something that we didn't get.

Speaker 3:          21:27          It's not a only been raised by my mother had been so much better if my father would have been there. It didn't hit on a good people with mothers who are crazy. There are people with fathers who are crazy. There are people with mothers and fathers who are crazy. There are people were mothers and fathers who live in big houses that are crazy. There are people with mothers and fathers who live in big houses and have phds who are still crazy. There are people who are fine, who had mothers and fathers and have phds. They are good looking crazy. Let me tell you something. Every body, light skin, dark skin, white folks, but folks, Brown folks, everybody has secrets, effort, everybody, potluck. Everybody has issues. Now when my comic queasy Mary go kind of crazy, I live, we have five kids with five new flavor of a crazy. The whole house looks like baskin and Robbins. Have you ever notice how old are your kids get? The harder it is for them to be in the house, very easy. When they're small, they don't have no pagan put on the blue dress, put on the blue pants wearing a red shirt. Then one day they say, I don't write that check.

Speaker 1:          22:37          The more premium native, they give them more difficult to get it and the more that the functions begin to show and the most secrets the family has because secrets are equal opportunity and experiences that we all can share. The young people today say they all had little secrets. They say they keep it real. They are hilarious, hilarious. Then they put real on facebook and commit a new crime because people are talking about it. There are some things, if you keep it real, you will lose it

Speaker 3:          23:16          and the reality is you get on my nerves because just standing there staring at me like you don't like if you said everything you talk to people, it would be the third World War. Keeping it real is destructive. You don't want to keep it real. You want to keep her the woman.

Speaker 2:          23:32          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          23:35          I live on the Cape up woman. Sometimes you got to such a mouth, sometimes you've got a whole your pitch. Sometimes you've got to be still and let the Lord fight for battle. Sometimes you got to say, I take sis, this is a job. Fuck God.

Speaker 3:          23:53          I believe your husband, but I can't be your daddy. Your grandpa had the childhood. I couldn't text you when, how crazy itself, but I'm talking to y'all and I'm lifting you up to God and if God Paul Fritz and it can't be done, you're the spiritual support though. You hear them say, I'm calling for backup. I love somebody I can't fix. I love somebody. I came straight out. I love somebody. I can heal my or this is driving me crazy and loud. They're crazy and this is on top of that drives it. Now the kid's crazy. It's mixed it with the crazy

Speaker 2:          24:33          have holes

Speaker 1:          24:39          probably is at a time that I am the most tired. I have no place to lay my head cause there's this just I treat lid on my son because I can't let him otherwise because there's issues. I can't live at home. My husband cause there's this was, and you wonder why you're falling apart and why you can't sleep and why your food doesn't digest well and you're wondering why you had mood swings. The reason you're having problems in spite of all of your was is that you have a place to work. You have a battle to fight, you have a job to kill, you have a mission, but you have no place too late.

Speaker 2:          25:29          Okay?

Speaker 3:          25:39          Oh,

Speaker 2:          25:45          okay.

Speaker 1:          25:52          The reason you are physically sick, right?

Speaker 3:          25:56          The reason who are hypertensive, diabetics stressed out eating disorders, the reason you have migraine headaches, the reasons that you're getting cancerous tumors is years and years and years of being a tough guy, crawled woman. Reality is you had no place to lay your head. You can't even wash up in the service because you felt worried about your image that when it's time to wash up, you're so busy trying to look masculine. That to miss a one place. He's got to take the weight up off of your phone.

Speaker 1:          26:33          Hey, I've got to stop there, but it's been a real joy to share the word of the Lord with you. I believe the best is yet to come in. I pray that the word you heard today will produce fruit in your life tomorrow. In Jesus' name. Be Blessed. I want to thank our partners for helping us make a difference in the lives of hurting people. No partnership has provided food, clothing, clean water, medicine, distribution. It's so much more at home and abroad. In fact, to the mega care, we are establishing medical camps and health clinics to increase the rate of survival while giving hope and healing to a hurting community. If you are not a partner, I encourage you to become one today.

Speaker 4:          27:16          God wants to give you the grace to be grounded in every aspect of your life.

Speaker 1:          27:20          You are a limited resource. Oh, blow out loud. God. It's getting rid of

Speaker 4:          27:34          for your gift to the Ministry of any size you will receive grounded in faith on cd from Bishop Jakes, mind renewing series, grace to be grounded.

Speaker 1:          27:41          It's basically a sub because it knocks it down to your knees

Speaker 4:          27:48          and when your gift is $110 or more, you'll receive grace to be grounded in its entirety on 70 days, your very own walk through the grace to be grounded series with Bishop Jakes, 28 day devotional and unique grace to be grounded art desk display.

Speaker 1:          28:09          Wow.

Speaker 4:          28:11          Don't be stuck in in fertile territory. Get the grace to be grounded.

Speaker 1:          28:25          Have you seen him as responsibility? You have turned salvation, the work I'm coming to the Lord. You are so performance oriented. You think you have to perform for God who can see your thoughts so far off? There's nothing about you. The Bible says that is not method before him with whom we have to do and the one chance you have to keep it real. You been keeping it moving with the one person that's safe to keep it real with and when they can find nothing else wrong with it. Then they attack his methodology. They kept asking this guy over and over and over again to tell the story. He said, it's just like I just told you. Then they took him to the first day. Tell him again. Yeah, I'm telling it again. It's interrogation. They weren't, they weren't even interested in whether he could see or not. They were using him to attack Jesus. Some of you are up in the battle right now and the battle is even about you. They are using you to attack somebody else around you. You might be going through a battle that's not even yours,

Speaker 2:          29:49          okay?

Speaker 1:          29:50          Because it's like you're getting the say the right thing. They could use his mouth to kill his master and when the enemy is out to assassinate someone who was a gifted or noise or promising, he will always try to use somebody's mouth. Are y'all going to talk to me? I'm not. They don't care whether he's blind or whether he could see they don't care whether he got a job but doesn't have a job. They don't care whether he has a future. I doesn't have a future. They have to keep asking them the same thing, a different way. Trying to get him to say something that they can use to attack Jesus. They don't care that he's blind or that he can see that he's not here. They are trying to get him to say something and then the Bible mentions that Jesus did it on the Sabbath Day.

Speaker 2:          30:53          Yeah, and from the fact then he healed him on the Sabbath Day. They concluded he is a sinner, a center.

Speaker 1:          31:10          It's not like Jesus was washing clothes or mended fences. Oh, working on the Sabbath Day. Jesus had a conversation and he spit. That's all he did on the Sabbath Day and from that

Speaker 2:          31:26          they said he is a sinner. He is a sinner.

Speaker 1:          31:37          Once people put a name on the how they hate you,

Speaker 1:          31:44          once they give that hate our name and the name is hateable, they want to find a category to put you in so that they can hate you better. When I came here, the pastor of this church, the Lord told me to call it the Potter's house in the early days of the church. You know what I'm about to say? In the early days, the church, new members are coming to me and they say they want to know what kind of church it is, is a potter's House Baptist Potter's house. Hey, ame Potter's house, Church of God in Christ Potter's House happened style church. What kind of church is it? So I went to God and I prayed about it. I said, the people want a name for the Potter's house they want. They want to know what kind of church it is. And the Lord spoke something to me. I will never forget. He said, son, don't give him no name because it's a cage fight. You know, fight the name you gave her once they got amazing that they could say

Speaker 3:          32:40          that Jesus wasn't God, they couldn't hate Jesus. But when they said Jesus is a sinner, no people who wouldn't have hated him, no hates him off the label that they put on him.

Speaker 1:          32:59          Let me tell you something, and all of a sudden Jesus is up under this cloud of suspicion that the pharisees have created around something that he set out to do. That was good. Now I'm really going to dig down and some of Y'all with me. Have you ever been doing something good with good intentions, right?

Speaker 3:          33:27          Really prime. It helps somebody and got kicked in the face for doing something good. It's not like you've never done anything bad. You go things bad before and got away with it and then did something good and all of a sudden all hell breaks loose. As you were saying, how in the world could you attack me?

Speaker 2:          33:51          Okay,

Speaker 3:          33:51          you attack me after I paid your rent. Talk for you to get a job opened up a door. You Go, I'm off. I don't mind being a time

Speaker 1:          34:06          when they found out it was the sabbath. They said he is a sinner. When they called him a sinner, the blind man said, I don't know. He's, I don't know whether he's the center now. I don't know anything about his doctrine. I don't know anything about his theology. I don't know anything about that. I don't know what you're all talking about it. I've never read the book of revelations. I don't know what his stance is. I don't know whether he democrat or Republican. I don't know whether he's got two wives or dog or billy goat.

Speaker 2:          34:39          Oh No.

Speaker 3:          34:44          Can I get a witness up in here? Can I get a witness?

Speaker 2:          34:50          Oh No. Okay.

Speaker 3:          34:53          Here's our one. I met him. I was blind and not the rest of it. Y'All can fight all day long, but all I know is that it works for me. Touch your neighbor. Tell them it works for me. You are in a season in your life that you don't have to prove anything to anybody. Oh, you got to do is tell him. Oh, is that it works for me. I don't know about your God. I'm not gonna argue with you about your religion. I don't tend to wash up Buddha. I don't serve the moon and the stars huddled, carefree, prayed to pluto

Speaker 5:          35:47          is that it works for me. This man Jesus, this man, Jesus set me free. This man, Jesus, Rog said my wife stopped me from killing myself. This man, Jesus picked me up off the ground. This man, Jesus gave me a second chair. I want somebody give yes.

Speaker 3:          36:26          How far somebody told him it works for me, my faith, my faith, my faith, my faith, my faith, my faith, my faith, my faith, my faith.

Speaker 5:          36:41          Cause whenever I start praising the name of Jesus, then the tremble. Because if I can't do that by the holiday, broken bow wellbeing, I want somebody to throw your head back in the Holler. Sure does he live in that night? Somebody out of place that turns water into wine. What are the goodness of Jesus and it all that is done for me. Wow. Radical. Open your mouth so people don't like y'all Bible Church. When you think about what God has done in your life,

Speaker 3:          38:31          mules to the way we wash them, they don't think it takes all of that. They think that you should come the church and the pastor says speech and you should sit there and be quiet. But the problem with that is as long as I speak and you don't say anything, it's a sign. You're not of age. They came to the boy's parents, parents to speak for him, but the parents said he's away. He can speak for himself.

Speaker 5:          39:07          You don't need this. Some shakes trump praise y'all, Lord. If he he'll do, he doesn't limit you. Bless you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. For the lamb shank somebody by the hand and tell him something that know he did. You hear that? A wax, you're in Hawaii

Speaker 2:          40:42          works for me.

Speaker 5:          40:46          It works for me. You can laugh at me. You can make fun of me. You can say it doesn't take all of that, but you want the one that was blind. You want the one that was down. You weren't the one that was suicidal. You weren't the one that was that job.
