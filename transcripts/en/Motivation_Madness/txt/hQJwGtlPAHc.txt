Speaker 1:          00:03          We all have this negative self talk that goes in our head. Guess what? There's enough people that are telling us we can't do it, that we're not good enough. Why do we want to tell ourselves that we know for a fact that thoughts influence actions? We sat there with the, um, with the video sheldon, Dr Levy, so right. We know that our thoughts influence actions. Why do we want to see that negative self talk to ourselves? We need to get our own self affirmation, Muhammad Ali. What was his self affirmation? I am the greatest. Who else is going to tell you they need to be quiet moments in your bedroom, quiet moments when you're brushing your teeth, that we need to reaffirm I am the captain of my ship and the master of my fate. That is my affirmation and looking forward to a time that I would feel good again, helped me to keep moving forward.

Speaker 1:          01:00          And sometimes I had to be brave and it wasn't always easy. Sometimes I faltered, I had bad days, but I realized that being brave isn't supposed to be easy. And for me, I feel it's the key way to keep moving forward. So all at all, I don't waste energy feeling bad for myself. I surround myself, people that I want to be with, and I keep moving. So with this philosophy, I hope that all of you, regardless of your obstacles, you can have a very happy life as well. When I am the captain of my ship, I don't see it. If no one else will get away, there's enough of that Muhammad Ali, I am the greatest. There is no one better than me. It's a difference between Hubris and ego and false pride. It's just reminding yourself and quiet silent moments. I put it down on the list. It's right beside my mirror

Speaker 3:          03:00          but you just feel within yourself some way somehow with the help of God, I'm going to make it happen. Repeat after me please. No matter how bad it is. Oh, how bad it gets. I'm going to make it. I'm going to make it shakes his hand on your right and left and say you got the right stuff. Yes, it's possible for you to live your dream

This has to be the important thing. Is this like what I'm saying? Listen, to me, the most important thing is this. To be able to sacrifice what you for.
