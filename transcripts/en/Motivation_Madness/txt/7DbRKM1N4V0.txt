Speaker 1:          00:07          I have a terrible experience, made a lot of mistakes when I was young and child. I think if you succeed, every mistakes become a legendary. If you feel that's just the garbage, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          00:32          I think

Speaker 1:          00:34          everybody has great stories. Everybody had a lot of mistakes, everybody have lot of problems. But very few people listen to you one day where it becomes successful. People listened to you say, wow, you are great. I'm not that great. I was born a normal family and I'm not a good as schooling. Of course, I tried to study hard, but as a boy, you know, my school was not that good at that time. So I felt looking for jobs, looking for joining university, joining good schools. But I never give up. And I think there's one thing I learned is that, um,

Speaker 1:          01:30          why, why you should have a chance to be successful. Everybody should get used to beat, get used to feel and get used to be accepted by other people. Why other people should help you. You should earn the right to be helped. So the thing I learned is that don't give up. My opportunity has not come yet. When everybody complain, that is the opportunity. I always thought when I was young, when I was graduate in the high school or university, I thought Bill Gates took up my job. You know, Bill Gates did all the successful things. Larry Ellison from Oracle, they, they took all the wonderful opportunities. IBM benefit, we people have no opportunity and I think our aim too high. I should aim to support and help the people around me to tiny things. I never thought I could be today after 18 years, Ali Baba become today's size. Not because I'm smart. I don't think I'm a smart person, but I have. I work with a lot of smarter people

Speaker 1:          03:00          and most of the smart people, they always want to do successful things, quick, easy things. And I think it's not easy to be successful quickly. Every time. Everything we do, we prepare for 10 years. I know I'm not smart. If we want to be successful, we have to win 10 years later. If we want to be successful, we have to work with smart people. If we want to be successful, we should make a lot of mistakes and never give up. A lot of people, they make mistake them problem. They give up. We never give up. We learn from the stakes and I think when we're filled their message, the experience that I want to give you a device, I want to give you, you a judge. When this person will be successful, not by where his cell, he thinks it's his fault or the other Ford, if he thinks my field, because of the others, this guy has no chance.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Those people who feel always think, hmm, it is my fun. I did not do the properly. I should change care or change you there. These guys have opportunities, so I learned a lot from those people who fail. I learned a lot from those people who made mistakes. I learned a lot from my mistakes. So this is what I, when I, this is my life attitude. When I feel I say, see, I will fail when I succeed. I said, well, I never know. I could be successful. This make me very positive and optimistic and because of so many mistakes, too much of failure that make me never complained. God, I get used to that. We are making this stick everyday. Even to today, we made stupid decisions almost every day. Nobody knows. We thought as smart, but finding approves stupid. But we learn. We'll do again. We'll learn. We'll do again. That's the way. That's the live attitude. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          05:32          I'll leave a, bob was born in China, but it was created for the whole world. So can you tell us what Alibaba does now outside of China and in particular in Russia? We're good buddy. Alibaba builds notice of the lawsuit, the [inaudible] Moses chimps than you might sally. Bubba [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          05:57          Yeah. Ali Baba stuff from no money, no technology, no people in my apartment, 18 people decide that we want the using Internet technologies to help small business. That was the idea. After 18 years, we grow from 18 people. Two today close to 60,000 people. It is really not easy, but we survive today. We are one of the biggest internet companies in the world. I think we're lucky we made so many mistakes, but we still survive. How can you be continued to be lucky? That is the question. Keep on asking me. I think if you want to continue to be lucky, you have to give your lot to the others.

Speaker 1:          07:10          You give luck to the others. You help others. The operas in the future, we're helping you. That was my, our thinking in the past 10 years. Ali Baba was born in China, but Alibaba should not be a Chinese company. The name the day when I choose the name Ali Baba, Ali Baba is not a Chinese name. It's a Arabic name and Iran's that is Iran nicknamed Turkey says taking him. I don't, I don't know we're in name, but it's the name from Alibaba, 1000 when mistakes or Alibaba, one founder, one nights the story. We want to make this company a company that Boeing Chinar enabled the world helping the global young company, young people. As I said that every century there's a company for the century. Microsoft was the company of last century as a great century. Ivn was a company of the century. What is the company of this century, 21st century and I think it's, we should not think about Alibaba. We should always, we make money, serve Chinese. We should have made the money, serve the world, serve this century. This only think in that way we can do more.

Speaker 1:          08:43          Our company today is big but compared to yesterday it was big but compared to tomorrow it is still a tiny company. The world changes so fast. So this is our thinking. We want to make all the Moba be the company of the century. We want make Alibaba the company supporting global, small, medium size companies. We want to make this company supporting global young people and we want to make this company to making sure women can have a more jobs online because people don't care. You're a woman or man online. This is what we want to do and we're doing a lot outside China, Southeast Asia. We are also doing lot in Indian. We just started doing more in America and the and also Canada. In Russia we have a small business that's called Ali Express. Maybe I'll express here is very big, but in Cha, all company, probably less than 1% of our business, Ali Express, but on express is not our main purpose of doing business in Russia. We do not want to be a Russia e commerce company.

Speaker 2:          10:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:12          We are not ecommerce company. We help other company become ecommerce. We hope what we want to do in Russia, we wanted to help you rusher to boot up their logistic system. Raj is so big, the live of things so difficult. Oh, I can. I imagine. I met to some Russian girls two years ago. I say, do you use Ad Express? A yes. Oh, sure. Uh, how long? What about the speed of delivery? They say it's great. I said, what do mean by grade? She said, only 45 days. I mean, Greg was 45 minutes, not 45 days. Now we've reduced from 45 days to 15 days, but that is not enough. Russia should have a more than logistics system that'd be able to deliver within 48 hours or 72 hours anywhere, any place or Russia where you place on an online, we should get it within 72 hours and this should have using technology. This is your opportunity. Young people logistics terrible and you have the chess. If were just as good, we have no chunks. We should have [inaudible] or the payment online, online payment today in China, the mobile phone payment, so popular. I went to

Speaker 2:          11:53          see a few weeks ago, I saw some beggars on the street. You are you back money. They use difficult mobile phone because people don't have a pocket of money.

Speaker 1:          12:06          So we in a rusher, we should have built up a good payment system. I'm more than payment system that every young people can receive money, pay money at the lowest cost. Every young people should have be able to reach financial assistance and we should have good up Russia's art express. We should have built up a Russia, alibaba.com this is what we want to do.

Speaker 1:          12:32          I'm okay whether on express someday in Russia, no business. But we should have luck rushing young people to develop its own logistic oh e commerce platform all click the payment platform. We would love to join this force. This is what we've been doing in the past two years. But how went to the Moscow university? I have a, I have a personal and dream in path two years cause I'm not a good at a mess. But computers size, big cloud computing. The basic is by the math. Physics. There's about computing technology. Moscow university, I think a, you guys have the best of physics to scientist and a mathematics. So I would hope that Alibaba, we just announced two weeks ago that we invested 15 billion US dollars. I'm building up a lab to solve the problem for future solve the problem for the world economy and social science.

Speaker 1:          13:52          So we hope that in Russia, in Moscow we can viewed a lab that work with the young excellent mathematicians from Russia, young physicist, scientist from Russia. We work together, China rushing young people, young scientists working together, solve problem for future. And I wanted to announce cure. Our cto of chief technology officer is coming to Moscow university very soon and we want a high as many young people as possible. Join. You don't have to work in China if you don't like. But if you love to work in China, we are very happy you can work I office here and joint together full cloud computing, big data for the future and artificial intelligence and machine intelligence. This is something we want to do. You Russia and this is something we wanted to do together with Moscow university. That was your talents. Here we have technology, we have data, we have consumers, we have a little bit money. You have talents. We work together. We can do something really big in this way. We can make Alibaba the company of the century.

Speaker 3:          15:29          I would like to hear your thoughts on technology today. Many people are wary of it and especially about the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs and society. What are your thoughts on this? Um, Jack? Yeah. Boy. [inaudible] minogue. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] that shot.

Speaker 1:          15:59          Don't worry about the future. All right. Don't worry about Tech College. Let me tell you one thing. Why are you worried about the future? That is because you are a lack of confidence. You lack of imagination. We don't have, I may not have the solution for future, but there is a solution for future. We don't have the solution for future, but our young people have a solution for future. I find and this wall, young people don't worry about the future. Older, the people worry for the future. I've found those six. Today's successful people, they worry about the future.

Speaker 1:          16:51          Let me tell you, future is the opportunity for everybody, especially the opportunity for young people because we have nothing to lose, right? This is what I tell myself. 18 years ago, 18 years ago, we did not have money so we can, we have no money to lose. We don't have the technology. We have no technology loose and then we say we believe 10 20 years later, e commerce. Internet will be powerful if we start to do now when a lot of success people successful people don't like technology, don't like Internet. We started doing 10 20 years later, we will be the expert. 10 20 years later we'll be successful. So I think don't worry about the future. Prepare for the future. Make your own future cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence. They are new to anybody. You are successful, new to you, you are not successful, new to you. So what do you worry about? Second thing is don't worry about the things the other people worry about, especially don't worry about the things president and prime minister worry about. Worry about things you worry about.

Speaker 1:          18:23          We everybody have too many things to worry about. If you do not worry about yourself, you worry too much about the world. Now today, Ali Baba should worry about the world. You should not worry about the world president of put these worry about what you should not worry about the world. You should worry about where you graduate. How can you make a living? How can they do something that is different? How can you do something that is fun, interesting, and helping others? By the way, don't believe that technology is going to take our way. Human beings jobs. Technology is going to replace a lot of stupid jobs. When the first, the technology revolution come, the steam machine comp people worry, oh my God, steamer, she is going to take our, we a lot of jobs. After 50 years, the steam machine created more jobs way electricity comps. Lot of companies worry about losing jobs. That electricity created so many jobs at the Fisher intelligence, they will create more jobs. The problem is next to 2030 years may lose credit, lose a lot of job, but this is shut period. So we people have to learn how we can survive in the artificial intelligent period. By the way, why human being can wing machines, machines, they might be stronger deck human being. They might be smart to that human being. They might be rough faster, the human being, but they can never be as wise as human beings because human being, we have belief, we have religion, we have a heart,

Speaker 1:          20:33          which machine does not have. So if you want to be ready for future, please did not follow yesterday's way of learning and teaching. Do not try to memory things harder and more because computer can't remember. Things are the more than you do not try to calculate to faster because the computer can, cal could it much faster than you do. So try to be creative, tried to be innovative, tried to be constructive. These are the things, everything you learn, you think about is this thing can make me more creative. This one can be mum making me more innovative. This thing can be make me more constructive as do it. And also I think when other people worry, opportunity comps, make them worry. You should know nobody will and nobody can stop this technology revolution. You worry, it comes. You don't worry. It comes. So what's the point of a worry? So I said people's a jet. Have you ever cried in the past 18 years doing the business internet in China?

Speaker 1:          22:10          I don't cry because I know quiet does not make any sense. Does that help me? If cry can help me, I would cry every day. We should not have cried. We shouldn't make competitors cry. So think about, be positive. Get ready for that. If you, people from Moscow university cannot a solve the problem. If you worry the whole, whoa, 19 nine 9% of people have no future. So don't worry about it. The positive started do it. And when people worry, open the door, see what are the worry about and the solve the problem. That's what I think. And we will work together.

Speaker 2:          23:11          You're a great believer,

Speaker 3:          23:14          young people as a c and you spend so much time with students and with young entrepreneurs. What advice is maybe some more you can give to all of us? Dick, we watch in village more than two d but [inaudible] [inaudible] that,

Speaker 1:          23:36          yeah, I love to be with young people first. I'm still yom. And a second is that when you mel young people, you know, you're young all the time and young people are the solutions for tomorrow.

Speaker 2:          23:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:56          Young people are the solutions for all the worries. Uh, young people. If you stay with them, you will be full of energetic. But the advice I give to the young people is that also the advice I'd give to myself, that nothing is easy. Nothing is free. If you want to be successful, you have to pay the price. I'll IBA by 18 years to today's size. Yeah, we are lucky. Oh, we work much harder than most of the people will never sleep well and sound in the evening. I travel last year, 867 hours a year in the flood plane in the plane. I'm working hard. My team working very hard. 18 years. We work like a normal company. 70 years, day and night. Nothing is free. Nothing is easy. Easy beings. You have to think different. You have to do different.

Speaker 2:          25:22          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:22          If you, everybody, if a John said this is the right you for John, why you so you have to think, for example, early days in my company, where's some ideas come to my desk. Jack, he's is a great idea and I look in every like everybody's saying it is a good idea. Uh, normally through into the rubbish because everybody say there's good. Then all the other people think of, if everybody say this is going to be very tough. I'm very interested in that tough question and a pickup and see how can we do in a different way. This is to be unique, to be different and the third, this is my advice and this is also telling myself every day today is very tough. Tomorrow is more tougher. The day off tomorrow is beautiful, but most people die tomorrow evening. You have to work very hard every tough days, every tough situation, problems with meat. That is the training of yourself where you graduated at your school,

Speaker 2:          26:45          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          26:47          graduate from this school. You just to start to your career of learning, you got a Ph d diploma, a bachelor diploma. This is just a certificate. Your Paris pay the tuition for four years. Your real challenge is where you leave the college. The real life starts. The real exam stats, the real test of stats. That's life. One thing you got lucky, as I said, if students from Moscow university cannot survive, 19 9.9% of people in the world cannot survive. Only you have this confidence, you will be able to face the challenge of future.

Speaker 2:          27:45          You

Speaker 3:          27:46          do jack for all these stories for all the sponsors. And now I will turn to the audience and you will have an ability and time to ask your own questions and I'll appreciate if you formulate them on English. But if you have some problems, we have someone who can repeat and we will help you. So who wants to be first?

Speaker 2:          28:08          Okay,

Speaker 3:          28:10          can you, can you tell us who are you your name and Bailey

Speaker 2:          28:18          law school? Yes. Oh,

Speaker 4:          28:23          my question is actually a little just retold rhetorical. So the times from one market is more complete and there are times when market is more competitive as an error is it's hard to keep being confident on yourself and your future.

Speaker 2:          28:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:38          Okay. So you formed the Lord Department. The question is that in the time the market is going to be more competitive, how can you keep the confidence for the future? Right. Knock it is never easy.

Speaker 2:          28:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:57          In the early day, just like a doing business is never easy. People say, Oh, I'm doing business more difficult. No, never is a continuum of more difficult. The confidence is not. The best way to do it is that find a good team. Find the people that share the same vision, same dreams, work with them. The only thing you listen is you listen to grover up people. If you doing a company, listen to customers. If they are happy, if they your customers are happy, don't worry too much. You Stu, have competitive. Is your companies of your customers happy? Listen to your colleagues, your team, a big confidence. If they have confidence, don't worry about it. Don't listen to a divisors lawyers. I'm sorry. Don't listen to those people are you have no chance whether the market as a child, so not custom tell you, your colleagues tell you.

Speaker 2:          30:19          So

Speaker 1:          30:21          nobody is the expert of future. Most of the experts I yesterday. So for the future, the best way you learn it is know the early days. Ali Baba had no money, no revenue, nobody pay us the revenue. We got all the, all the email of thanks from customers. The customer send us email. Oh Ali Baba, you're so great. You're helping me a lot, but I don't have money to pay you fine. We know one day they will pay if we really help them. So the confidence is from the customer's confidence is from your team. Hey, y'all competitors always tried to destroy your competence. If your competitors spend a lot of time is joy, competence or confidence, that means you're good.

Speaker 2:          31:21          Thank you.

Speaker 5:          31:28          Oh, oh, sorry. No, my question is going to be watching price from us as well. To me just keep, uh, Jack, uh, my question is going to be a bit sophisticated. Well, each is going to be regarding Russia and delivery system. Uh, that's, you inspired us to build up, to build up the good one better than it is now. Uh, however, obviously we do not have this financial opportunity that your company has steel. We do not have a labor model delivery now. Well, it as the first question, second question. Uh, he does all of this that as like ass others fees of production of goods and services in Russian economy is monopolized by government corporations. What do you think of prospectus and efficiency in Thomas in terms of economic development of this current situations

Speaker 1:          32:35          in the current market? Thank you. Thank you. Good crushes. The first question is will a good of a logistic system, but we don't have as much money as Ali Baba, so how can you be successful? Right? Tell me anybody who has some money for building up our logistics system.

Speaker 2:          32:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:00          I don't have money for good apple. I don't think Ali Baba has the money to build up rusher logistic system cost then is then as billions of money. Nobody has the money back has the money they would not give you. This is the opportunity. You don't it first. It's impossible to build up of sophisticated at the logistics. Them within one year takes about 10 1512 years and you have to do little by little.

Speaker 2:          33:42          Okay,

Speaker 1:          33:42          this is the challenge. I got nine year to file the one who's on them to people's came to me say when we go for raising money, people ask, how can you be successful? No Internet in China enough, no logistic, no credit card, no money, no talents. How can they be successful? This question, I'd been challenged year up to you because everybody has no money. That's the opportunity for entrepreneurs sync. Great. If every business stopped from tiny business,

Speaker 2:          34:31          we,

Speaker 1:          34:32          well we start Alibaba, we try, I go to a lot of, I go to China Post. Yeah. I go to SOS say, can you help us to deliver this are no, no, no, no, no. You're too tiny to small. We don't deliver. So we went to the entrepreneurs who want to deliver from their own village on city owned properties. So we're helping them

Speaker 2:          34:58          today. We

Speaker 1:          35:04          65 million packages per day in China. We delivered them. How many people work here on that? 3 million people working on that. We never do ourselves. We do that a high 3 million. We help them get the jobs. So let me tell you, 15 years ago, Chinar logistic system was so bad trying to post same speed like the Russia today, nobody believe it to work. How can you work, right? China is also a big country. The only thing is we have a bet more population, more people,

Speaker 2:          35:59          but

Speaker 1:          36:00          we think it's opportunity. The developer countries, the logistic cost of the economy is today 12% of the GDP of the other cost country and I can China under developed countries developing countries, they like six 16% today because of the Internet we are able to lower down to seven and 6% this depends on you. It's your opportunity. If you want to do it, it's young. If, if young people want to do it, you will be. There's a chance. Don't talk to success. This woe to convincing successful people is the most difficult thing. We are not successful. You say I want to deliver this thing for my city. I don't think about the whole rusher just in my city. You will win if you say I want to build up a whole logistic for whole rusher. You don't have channels. Nobody would give you money because everybody working for same cities where you connect, it's going to be big. This is my advice. Rusher has chest. You can learn a lot from Alibaba experience sharpton.

Speaker 2:          37:31          Hm.

Speaker 1:          37:33          Right. So we are our, our packages delivered every day off our company alone. Big then whole us and package hold country. We made it happen in 10 years. You also can make it happen, right? It's not about money. When you do, right, where do proper, if you do the right direction, money will come. If you, a lot of people say, if I have money, I'm going to do this. I say, you will never have the money. If you do this things delicate, you really want to do it a made progress. Money will come. This is the first question. Second is have a monopsony.

Speaker 1:          38:18          Yeah, rusher. I saw Moscow very beautiful this time. Much cleaner, more traffic, very sad, but I've never been to a lot of other cities. I think Russia economy should be focused on more private business. Small Business. Not sure. We really rely on the oil. Gasoline amage big s he stayed on the business. Big private company. We should have more entrepreneurs. Dynamic, tiny, small business and this is what we think. This is the future business model of 21st century. I think if we have more small business, every small business can export thing. Well, by the way, let me tell you, people say, oh, Russian commerce and very developed Russia. Ecommerce today is a tiny infant baby less than a baby. Your ecommerce put together less than 1% of the total Russia retail. It's more like a 12 years ago. China. It's a huge opportunity, but don't wait for the monopoly. They would do it. Don't wait for the SOE. Don't wait for the logistic ready. Don't wait for the back. Ready. You should do before they are ready. If everything's already why they need to you is everybody. Everything's already. You have no chance because everything's already you have the chance, but get ready for the tough days.

Speaker 2:          40:12          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          40:19          Curly hair. Oh, of course. Of course you will be next.

Speaker 2:          40:41          Uh, and uh, yeah. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          41:14          Yeah. First let me tell you that the language is very important that you speak good English does not mean you will do global business knowledge or don't use. He made a speech here, right? Maza dog does not speak, uh, English. Nixon did not speak Chinese, but this older two guy made a global deal. China, us, you're working together. It's the vision. It's the belief that you have that change the world. But let me tell you another thing. Language is so important. It helped me a lot because of artificial intelligence. In the future, you don't, people say, I don't need to learn English or Russian or Japanese or something. A chip here can check later quickly. No, it's not about language. It's about the culture where you learn the other language. You start understand the other culture. You start to appreciate, respect the other culture where you appreciate respect the other culture.

Speaker 1:          42:35          You will be respected and appreciated by the others. Then you can work it out together. I learned my English by myself when I was child. I never got to one day English training class all side China, but I think I understand the western culture much more better than those Chinese students study outside because I'm not learning language and learning culture where you respect the other culture where you appreciate the other culture. It's easy to make friends if you don't like the other culture. You will never make friends if you don't have friends, how can you do business? So I would say language helped me a lot, but most thing helped me is my respect for the different culture. I wish I could speak Russian. The more I come here, the more I learn a lot. I asked one of the Russian guy, why no rushing through tough and Chinese too gentle. How can they mix together? And he asked you a very good, he said, check this country is so code. We have to be tough. I the house is so good weather so we don't have to be tough. Yeah. So if you, if you have to everything with a translator, no. Cool. Sometimes you have to write, but if you can't understand a language that can community, it's easier for you to communicate. Easy to understand and be understood. Thank you. I hope I answer your question.

Speaker 2:          44:51          So

Speaker 3:          44:54          let's ask this girl who turned one to Tusk and then someone next.

Speaker 2:          45:01          Yup.

Speaker 3:          45:02          Please. Please present yourself.

Speaker 2:          45:10          Yup.

Speaker 3:          45:14          Hello, my name is [inaudible] Tech Entrepreneur, uh, and then founder of hydro, which is a unique nona cosmetics, a brand for apparel and footwear is it was developed here in Moscow State University. Uh, so my question, um, Mr Ma, before you created an Alibaba, all the small businesses in China, all the small manufacturers is they didn't have access to the global market. And right now we have a similar problem in Russia, but wasn't intellectual products, not was manufactured goods, not with commodities, but with innovations, with inventions. Like look at this audience is this pool of scientists and inventors and we have many more, we'll have millions of talented people in Russia who are developing a high quality, creative and innovative technologists. But our local market is too small. It cannot digest and it's a huge waste is, and this such a shame that all of this, um, technologists are not serving to the humanities. So my question is, what would you advise us to do in order to give to Russian intellectual products? Uh, access to the global markets.

Speaker 1:          46:30          All right, thank you. Sure. Lot of people have a great technology inventions, but they cannot do a, Russia is too small market and the offside market, there's no access. So what's, how can do it pops in though with the others popped into was a company like Alibaba. Okay home. So a lot of people, if you are good that invention, but you may not a good at the marketing. If you're good at marketing, normally you're not a good animation. So people need to work it together. If you have a great invasion or you extremely strong and good at invention and creative to college, must've fine good business people to pop in there and finding good. So like me, I know little about technology today. I'm so happy we don't use PC. The only thing I can use my pc and the sen receive email and the brows, I don't know how to use to. I'm happy we all use a mobile phone. I'm not a technology guy, but I know if we, if I want to, if we want to realize our dream, we must have the technology. But if I don't know the technology, we should invite the best engineers and science I worked with them or listened to them.

Speaker 1:          48:14          Nobody can do anything. What you should do is always

Speaker 2:          48:21          form a team. I think

Speaker 1:          48:26          it is very difficult to make exact company like Alibaba. Again, you can make a company better than Alibaba, but it would be difficult to make exact business model. Our model, I will not say be great, but it's a very workable our model because of 18 years, especially for the first 10 years, nobody believe it. Everybody say Jack, my stupid crazy too is something that will never make money. So the smart people, rich people never be our competitors

Speaker 2:          49:08          that give us chance. So finding good partner, find a good team

Speaker 1:          49:21          and always focus on the things that you are good at. Focus on the things that you love and that is the record of partnership. I see that. I give you a device for those young people.

Speaker 2:          49:43          If you

Speaker 1:          49:44          uh, 20 to 30 years old, please find a good boss. Not, not necessarily good company. Learn from the bus. Learn how to do it while you have 30 to 40 years old. Try to do something yourself if you really want to try while you're 40 to 50 years old, two things that you are good at after 20 years of learning is you should do something or good at where you are. 50 to 60 years or so. Spending time supporting young people where you are. Sixth over 60 are sold. Spend time with your grandchildren. Right. Is normally a lot of people like that. So where you are graduate, why you just in the university don't think about I want resigned from the school and be under the Bill Gates because Bill Gates left Harvard. There's only one bill gates in the world. When you graduate find a company most important. Find a good boss. They can see you, discipline you and tell you what is good and right is more important in a good company. Right. Of course. I'm good comment. I go Boston even better and then continue your life. It's all about the partner.

Speaker 2:          51:23          Sure. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          51:31          These guys one? Yes. You or your friend. Okay. Well yeah, I'm not supposed to meet him across from yes. And it will be the last question. Sorry. I'm fortunate to be our time runs out.

Speaker 2:          51:45          Okay. Can you repeat it?

Speaker 3:          52:35          Yup. I'll just repeat the question. So every week. So um, she said three weeks ago, Alibaba launch team all in Russia and is wondering what opportunities there are for people in the room to contribute to to Alibaba is team all team. How will you and your team developed team all here in Russia?

Speaker 2:          53:03          Okay. Thank

Speaker 1:          53:05          you very much for this question. I think Timo rusher is something that Web testing personally my wish is that she more rusher k in spy. As many people, as many entrepreneurs as possible, they can do the same thing. We not necessarily want to make Timo Russia big. I hope you understand my seat cause we don't want Ali Baba one day become the largest e commerce company in Russia. This is no, this is my dream. This is not our dream. We won by work held Timo rusher. Lot of no house, lots of experience, lots of things we'll learn from Russia market. Can you share with people so more young people in Russia start to do things our ecommerce, that is something that really want to do. So we

Speaker 2:          54:14          sing that

Speaker 1:          54:17          Alibaba. Aliexpress is something we want to do a better job. Odd Express today is helping Chinese products. Oh, you're a or you ship product to Russia. The peppers is what we want is help you Russian products to the world. This is what we want to do. So we are very, very happy that we are just her. Before I came here, I was, I was having a lunch with our team in Moscow. We have about 100 colleagues here

Speaker 2:          54:59          and I sat

Speaker 1:          55:01          in 10 15 years, we must have 5,000 people in Russia. That means we need at least four foul than 900 people.

Speaker 1:          55:16          These 5,000 people is not to the economy because five people do ecommerce in Russia does not a work. 5,000 people kiss support rusher, sme to do ecommerce. 5,000 people can help logistic to better. 5,000 people can help payment better. 5,000 people can helping the sme promoting their products better. So this is our thinking. So many people keep on asking me, Jack, you know you are coming here to conquer and the occupy a whole rusher. You're not going to take our way. A lot of our business, no, no, no. This is not our purpose. We're not Amazon Ali Baba.

Speaker 2:          56:11          No,

Speaker 1:          56:11          I mean we are better than Amazon. We just have a different the business model. So we want to have him more talents from Russia joining Ali Baba. And we also have a lot of problems or translation for Ali Express. Right? People say, I have a funny translations, which I'm sorry I don't understand, but people say it's great we have a unique language capability, but I hope that

Speaker 2:          56:42          I ope

Speaker 1:          56:44          more and more young people in Russia getting jobs because of ecommerce infrastructure. Finding jobs on the logistic but not logistic does not mean delivered. Logistic is smart logistic based on data, technology and payment. So this is something about how to joining Ali Baba. I'm very happy to hear that. And uh, we have a office here and uh, maybe I should, uh, right to my eating. Yeah. Okay. Of course I ride a bike. I'm not my email that my contact email, the guys I don't read email.

Speaker 2:          57:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          57:41          I think the world is getting so complicated by reading emails. You write a long email with time. She grier iml and then everybody remail the efficient to the mobile phone is much more efficient. So, but I leave email address of the, uh, of the contact. So if you are interested at a, working with Alibaba, joining Alibaba and thinking about the physics or computer or all math, we'll be very happy and we will get the email and contact you. She's got money to you.

Speaker 2:          58:31          Y A N, yeah, at Tom Bout right.
