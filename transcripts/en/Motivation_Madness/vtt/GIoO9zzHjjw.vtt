1
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is intimate.</v>

2
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I was told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was told that the biggest problem</v>

3
00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:17.980
<v Speaker 1>tyler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have this afternoon is</v>

4
00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:20.470
<v Speaker 1>getting Tony Robin Robins to come out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his shell.</v>

5
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.670
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't be shy here today.</v>

7
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 1>It's all going to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking backstage and,</v>

8
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you teed up a question that,</v>

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>that I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is part of every business owner's</v>

10
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>journey and that is the art and science</v>
<v Speaker 1>of overcoming the obstacles that you</v>

11
00:00:41.351 --> 00:00:43.630
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are inevitable.</v>

12
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are existential.</v>

13
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they are fear inducing most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

14
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.490
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when you hit one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles?</v>

15
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really important.</v>

16
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great to be with you all here.</v>

17
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I know you've had a full day and I hope</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that's some real value to you in this</v>

18
00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>brief time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really critical that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that everybody wants to grow</v>

20
00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:08.590
<v Speaker 1>their business and we all go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>different phases,</v>

21
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Just like human beings go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>phases.</v>

23
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give birth to your business and</v>

24
00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>you're an infant and an infant as a run</v>
<v Speaker 1>for survival and cashflow problems or</v>

25
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>natural process in most cases in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

26
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you get to a teenager or were</v>
<v Speaker 1>now cashflow is not a problem.</v>

27
00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>You're growing like crazy and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a new problem.</v>

28
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:28.210
<v Speaker 1>You don't have systems in place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you get the young adult where you</v>

29
00:01:28.211 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 1>have to decide what you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do eventually hopefully get to prime</v>

30
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.450
<v Speaker 1>where you're growing your business</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenues and you're growing your profits</v>

31
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>and you've got a professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

32
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.430
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing it because as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it really you don't have a</v>

33
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:41.770
<v Speaker 1>business what you have as you're self</v>
<v Speaker 1>employed and there's nothing wrong with</v>

34
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:44.620
<v Speaker 1>being self employed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there whenever you meet someone</v>

35
00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>who's in businesses stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always a business operator and</v>

36
00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 1>my focus has become a business owner.</v>

37
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You realize that the choke hold on,</v>

38
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>the growth of your business is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader and it's your skills and it's</v>

39
00:01:56.531 --> 00:02:00.310
<v Speaker 1>your psychology and I've found it's 80%</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology and 20% skills.</v>

40
00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:02.590
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have the marketing skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be able to lead,</v>

41
00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:04.450
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be able to recruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to do all those things.</v>

42
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.690
<v Speaker 1>But really most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get it through what I call the</v>

43
00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>threshold of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this to me is the secret to really</v>

44
00:02:11.021 --> 00:02:13.360
<v Speaker 1>succeeding in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty simplistic.</v>

45
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you a snowboard or ski?</v>

46
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Anybody out there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some numbers?</v>

47
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Can you give me a sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

48
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.970
<v Speaker 1>most people are terminally intermediate</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they get in that sport,</v>

49
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

50
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:23.860
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

51
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 1>they really never get back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

52
00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 1>They're not really a belonger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of you in the middle and</v>

53
00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 1>they never get much better.</v>

54
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason is they never</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed themselves beyond what they can</v>

55
00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>handle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.431
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

57
00:02:33.431 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 1>you're used to Greens or blues and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>find yourself on a double black.</v>

58
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything inside you freaks out because</v>

59
00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:42.010
<v Speaker 1>you're a pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I call the threshold of control,</v>

60
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>your comfort zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you look down and you go,</v>

61
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I could die doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you have two choices.</v>

62
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people slam themself on the ground</v>

63
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:53.740
<v Speaker 1>and hang on for dear life and try not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>skid off the cliff and at best what you</v>

64
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 1>do with survive or a few people let go</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their fear,</v>

65
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>no matter how scary it is and goes I to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go down this thing and there's no other</v>

66
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they focus on where they want to go</v>

67
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>instead of what they're afraid of and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find a way to carve.</v>

68
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And once you carve a few of them that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doba black is your bitch,</v>

69
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry about that</v>

70
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what happens in business.</v>

71
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember going and starting my</v>

72
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>first business in Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British Columbia,</v>

73
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got on the radio show and this person</v>

74
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>was a shock jock radio show and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

75
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>And they started attacking me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

76
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm a wire and a charlatan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do these things.</v>

77
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>And this therapist called me up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

78
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with people forever.</v>

79
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>You can't wipe out a phobia in less than</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour.</v>

80
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>It can take seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've a patient right now,</v>

81
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with for seven years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>been able will solve this.</v>

82
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:39.904
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

83
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>bring that patient tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a free guest event at the</v>

84
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Holiday Inn and all take care of it.</v>

85
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>It should take me 10 to 15 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do it.</v>

86
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was able to do it.</v>

87
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>A wrap the snake around this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had a snake phobia phobia is an</v>

88
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>uncontrollable response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because of that I had people coming</v>

89
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>to these guests events like crazy and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I hit the home run right.</v>

90
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>And I did this big guest event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like a thousand people there</v>

91
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>for me would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

92
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>100,000 people under that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

93
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>after I was done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people signed up for my</v>

94
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>seminar because I did a free value add</v>
<v Speaker 1>event and then I would invite them to</v>

95
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>come spend three days with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this man walks up to me and he's</v>

96
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 1>from immigration.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And these people have classes of 20</v>

117
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>people and you've got a class of 500 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they say,</v>

118
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 1>you're taking jobs.</v>

119
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 1>So your event is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean your events?</v>

120
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you walk on that stage tonight,</v>

121
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 1>we will handcuff you and deport you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I call a threshold with</v>

122
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

123
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to get the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

124
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get the money back.</v>

125
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I spent all the money and put on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>seminar.</v>

126
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a good businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to help everybody,</v>

127
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I spent all the money and he goes,</v>

128
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>you have no money while you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to deal with that.</v>

129
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>So I walked out of the building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have 40 minutes.</v>

130
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>People are going to arrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't go on stage.</v>

131
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my three staff members,</v>

132
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>two of which were volunteers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

133
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:31.084
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

134
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we're doing.</v>

135
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

136
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go to jail so I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to jail.</v>

137
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:41.731
<v Speaker 1>So how close is the board?</v>
<v Speaker 1>True story?</v>

138
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.031
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

139
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>this a place called Bellingham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>

140
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>It's about an hour and 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

141
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>rent money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six buses,</v>

142
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>and I'll meet the people out front</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they go on the hotels is not a</v>

143
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:53.450
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made everybody up front.</v>

144
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.990
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a traveling seminar.</v>

145
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:56.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

146
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.170
<v Speaker 1>We're going to</v>

147
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.690
<v Speaker 1>go into America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a three day seminar.</v>

148
00:06:01.691 --> 00:06:05.200
<v Speaker 1>We had to go and come back each day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>night for three days in a row.</v>

149
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I got all the four people to agree to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

150
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.450
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I got to go here in Washington</v>

151
00:06:09.451 --> 00:06:11.110
<v Speaker 1>at the Holiday Inn there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>

152
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.230
<v Speaker 1>there was like a bar Mitzvah or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wedding or some stuff mixed door and it</v>

153
00:06:14.231 --> 00:06:17.470
<v Speaker 1>was so loud you couldn't hear anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I said,</v>

154
00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:19.750
<v Speaker 1>just lie on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close your eyes is going to hit the ties</v>

155
00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:21.040
<v Speaker 1>you into this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

156
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.460
<v Speaker 1>But so what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you learn how to get through</v>

157
00:06:24.461 --> 00:06:25.150
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

158
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.780
<v Speaker 1>And we learned how to be resourceful</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you realize that your problem is</v>

159
00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:33.400
<v Speaker 1>not a lack of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not a lack of money or technology or</v>

160
00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:35.500
<v Speaker 1>contacts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If not,</v>

161
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.670
<v Speaker 1>it's your psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the ultimate resource is</v>

162
00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:41.950
<v Speaker 1>resourcefulness and human emotion.</v>

163
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.590
<v Speaker 1>That's what starts wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes a business begin.</v>

164
00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:47.140
<v Speaker 1>That's how you have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we end wars.</v>

165
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:49.600
<v Speaker 1>It's all emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I really learned to do was</v>

166
00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:51.720
<v Speaker 1>how to manage my emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

167
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.470
<v Speaker 1>once you saw that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next one shows up.</v>

168
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I had somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started franchise and cup Franchisees</v>

169
00:06:56.921 --> 00:06:59.020
<v Speaker 1>were really upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're wanting people representing on my</v>

170
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:02.140
<v Speaker 1>side said they didn't make things clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them and you know,</v>

171
00:07:02.141 --> 00:07:05.110
<v Speaker 1>it's all bullshit but cost me $5 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>in four years.</v>

172
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I thought the first one was like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,000 challenge and I've got a $5</v>

173
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.600
<v Speaker 1>million challenge and it took all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money I'd saved in my entire career to</v>

174
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:15.340
<v Speaker 1>pay that off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was starting over again.</v>

175
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.000
<v Speaker 1>And then I grew from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I finally got,</v>

176
00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:21.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to add a partner in business.</v>

177
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:24.340
<v Speaker 1>And long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a business that was losing $1</v>

178
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.970
<v Speaker 1>million a day and he turned it around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make it 1.8 billion and Ebitda the</v>

179
00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:28.870
<v Speaker 1>offer be his partner.</v>

180
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.240
<v Speaker 1>And I signed a document saying we're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>joint and several,</v>

181
00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:33.790
<v Speaker 1>there's 40 million in debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured I had 10 million of the debt</v>

182
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.240
<v Speaker 1>to have 1,000,008 1.8 billion in</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure.</v>

183
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.590
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out my partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.210
<v Speaker 1>two of them were broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't billionaires,</v>

185
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.580
<v Speaker 1>they had lost their money and the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>one was the son of a billionaire in his</v>

186
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:47.860
<v Speaker 1>dad had given them nothing at $5 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>to his band.</v>

187
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.870
<v Speaker 1>I was on the hook shortly after $420</v>
<v Speaker 1>million when they didn't have $120</v>

188
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.400
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget how to deal with that.</v>

189
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.040
<v Speaker 1>By doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eventually took my companies to this</v>

190
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.910
<v Speaker 1>year will surpass $6 billion and 33</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies cause I made it through the</v>

191
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:03.430
<v Speaker 1>threshold of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want you to know when you see these</v>

192
00:08:03.431 --> 00:08:07.750
<v Speaker 1>big numbers by any entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all started with blocking and</v>

193
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:11.020
<v Speaker 1>tackling and they all started with how</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I get both the skill and the more</v>

194
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:13.240
<v Speaker 1>importantly the psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get the skill.</v>

195
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.970
<v Speaker 1>If you can get that part of you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't die,</v>

196
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.240
<v Speaker 1>the part of me that finds the way to add</v>
<v Speaker 1>more value than anybody else that you</v>

197
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:22.420
<v Speaker 1>can keep growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does the perseverance come from</v>

198
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.000
<v Speaker 1>for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

199
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.290
<v Speaker 2>cause the indomitable spirit come from</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

200
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.310
<v Speaker 2>The title of your book unshakeable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does the,</v>

201
00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.510
<v Speaker 2>does the drive come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did not grow up in easy</v>

202
00:08:36.511 --> 00:08:37.550
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

203
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.220
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No College at all.</v>

204
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All self educated,</v>

205
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.840
<v Speaker 2>self educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a household that was not easy.</v>

206
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.160
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that part of the reason that you are</v>

207
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:55.220
<v Speaker 2>as perseverance as you are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As optimistic as</v>

208
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.100
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it was a way to comp it.</v>

209
00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Toot too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it developed moxy.</v>

210
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother was a really good woman.</v>

211
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't talk about it when she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive and I frankly,</v>

212
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 1>even if she passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't talk about it until one day I</v>

213
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 1>was sitting in front of a group of 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids that are all are abused by their</v>

214
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:16.170
<v Speaker 1>parents and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I told them that,</v>

215
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your biography is not your destiny and</v>

216
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 1>you're not defined by what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I could see in their eyes,</v>

217
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 1>big Paul White,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich guy,</v>

218
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't understand.</v>

219
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 1>And so I told him the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom beating me against the wall,</v>

220
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:29.210
<v Speaker 1>to my head bled point with itself down</v>
<v Speaker 1>my throat too.</v>

221
00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I threw up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think in order to protect my</v>

222
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>younger brother and sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to become a practical psychologist</v>

223
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.670
<v Speaker 1>that drove me and I developed moxy to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to deal with stuff.</v>

224
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 1>So that was the gift that my mom had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been the mother I'd wanted to be.</v>

225
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be the man I'm proud to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so that was the gift in it.</v>

226
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.210
<v Speaker 1>But I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drive part is falling in love with</v>

227
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 1>your customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love people.</v>

228
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I've always loved people and I hate</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering because I've suffered and I</v>

229
00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 1>loved the white people up and not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>light him up,</v>

230
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 1>pump them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to have another skill.</v>

231
00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Having a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a system,</v>

232
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:01.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do my bootcamps each year for our</v>

233
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 1>business mastery programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee everybody there,</v>

234
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 1>and the day one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have $1 million of value in your</v>

235
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or we'll give you,</v>

236
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>keep all of this stuff you've got and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll give you your money back.</v>

237
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:13.440
<v Speaker 1>No one ever leaves because I know how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>add that value in the business for those</v>

238
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

239
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.770
<v Speaker 1>So I think the drive is the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

240
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I think businesses make as many</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses are started by people that</v>

241
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 1>you built a product you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that may still be true for you.</v>

242
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Like you built this great jewelry or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>built this great software or you or</v>

243
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:31.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever skill set you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is the world changes so</v>

244
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 1>fast now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

245
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm old enough who remembers the Sony</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walkman?</v>

246
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Anybody ancient and that that product</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than 20 years now product like</v>

247
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even last a year,</v>

248
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The competition is too high.</v>

249
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.570
<v Speaker 1>So today if you and I are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really succeed,</v>

250
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:48.360
<v Speaker 1>you got to fall in love with your ideal</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer.</v>

251
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know that right now the</v>

252
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:55.110
<v Speaker 1>economy we have is looking pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to correct because we've</v>

253
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:58.380
<v Speaker 1>done nothing since 2008 set print,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more money and we didn't print money and</v>

254
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 1>we put ones and Zeros and computers.</v>

255
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 1>So there's gonna be some corrections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when those happens,</v>

256
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>it's going to shake people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to fall in love with a client</v>

257
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 1>who's going to do well with you even</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the economy goes to hell.</v>

258
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starbucks,</v>

259
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting across from our jolts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a great conversation and say,</v>

260
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 1>what does he most proud of him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

261
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:15.330
<v Speaker 1>he used to say starting starbucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he said,</v>

262
00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 1>now it's surviving 2008 as they closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 1300 stores,</v>

263
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:22.470
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly it for $2</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

264
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.570
<v Speaker 1>So you need to get your ass ready for</v>
<v Speaker 1>winter because it's coming and if you</v>

265
00:11:25.571 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 1>ever got challenges now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do,</v>

266
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 1>if you do well in winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll dominate for the rest of the time</v>

267
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.380
<v Speaker 1>and the way you do well mentor is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall in love with your ideal clients and</v>

268
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:36.810
<v Speaker 1>then you come up with the irresistible</v>
<v Speaker 1>offer for them.</v>

269
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.810
<v Speaker 1>You know Steve Jobs created 99 cent</v>
<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>

270
00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:41.880
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't create that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know that we're to come from</v>

271
00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:44.310
<v Speaker 1>WHO's old enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Columbia House where you got</v>

272
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:46.920
<v Speaker 1>like 10 albums for a buck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that are for corridor and</v>

273
00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:49.140
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They built a billion dollar company,</v>

274
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Tom Shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty product.</v>

275
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Greg,</v>

276
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 1>what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but two for one,</v>

277
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 1>being able to do something where I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I benefit somebody else.</v>

278
00:11:58.091 --> 00:11:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the whole company on that,</v>

279
00:11:59.911 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 1>he didn't build on the product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he booked it on the mission,</v>

280
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need an irresistible offer for</v>

281
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>the client who is ideal for you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to fall in love with a client.</v>

282
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't fall in love with your product or</v>
<v Speaker 1>service because those need to change.</v>

283
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 1>And if you fall in love with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>product or service,</v>

284
00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.100
<v Speaker 1>somebody is going to beat you.</v>

285
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.410
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be anticipated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell businesses,</v>

286
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.440
<v Speaker 1>there's two businesses you have to run</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage right now.</v>

287
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.560
<v Speaker 1>You have to run the business you're in</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't want him at your</v>

288
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 1>castle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your challenges are going to bite you.</v>

289
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.260
<v Speaker 1>But you also have to run the business</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're becoming and both businesses you</v>

290
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 1>have to making progress on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get all excited about the future</v>

291
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>and all the cool stuff that's coming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go work on that and there's no</v>

292
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 1>cashflow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you're dead in the water.</v>

293
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>If you just work on today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to wake up and go,</v>

294
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:40.330
<v Speaker 1>what the hell happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My competition beat me.</v>

295
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 1>It's those two sides and my 33</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

296
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I look at what the company is now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it has to be constantly.</v>

297
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.370
<v Speaker 1>So there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing the,</v>

298
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

299
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 1>the grunt work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

300
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:54.010
<v Speaker 1>the important day to day work while</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're anticipating the future.</v>

301
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.470
<v Speaker 1>When you were building your businesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've gone through an evolution,</v>

302
00:12:59.471 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>it's all business owners do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what you were doing 30 years ago</v>

303
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:07.951
<v Speaker 1>isn't really what you're doing today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How and when did you know that you were</v>

304
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:14.521
<v Speaker 1>doing in life what you were meant to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I think that's part of the quest</v>

305
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.390
<v Speaker 1>of the entrepreneur is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to achieve that.</v>

306
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 1>When did you know it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you know it?</v>

307
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.690
<v Speaker 1>When did I know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've known you,</v>

308
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different stages at different levels</v>

309
00:13:27.851 --> 00:13:28.750
<v Speaker 1>at different times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

310
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:30.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

311
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I can remember one that stands out from</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and yes,</v>

312
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.750
<v Speaker 1>that pops in my head is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Clinton calling me.</v>

313
00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I was with Peter Guber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

314
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.660
<v Speaker 1>my partner in the sports business and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>both them the yellow AAFC new in the mls</v>

315
00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:42.440
<v Speaker 1>franchise soccer franchise to build a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stadium there.</v>

316
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I was at his home and asked him that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

317
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 1>the president is on the line for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was President Clinton and I</v>

318
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>picked the phone and I talked to present</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a few minutes and he told me what's</v>

319
00:13:51.191 --> 00:13:51.821
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

320
00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Mister President,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely honored.</v>

321
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:55.120
<v Speaker 1>You want me to come visit with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd love to,</v>

322
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:57.390
<v Speaker 1>but I want you to know I'm not a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

323
00:13:57.391 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

324
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.400
<v Speaker 1>it was the time when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you said the economy stupid.</v>

325
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And then he turned around and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things aren't related to the economy and</v>

326
00:14:02.561 --> 00:14:04.210
<v Speaker 1>he looked like a very weak president at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>

327
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 1>And I remember Peter Looking at color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just told the fucking United States</v>

328
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 1>you're not a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

329
00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:11.680
<v Speaker 1>you tell him inviting you to come out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camp,</v>

330
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was great.</v>

331
00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:14.081
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

332
00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:14.914
<v Speaker 1>I want to be sincere.</v>

333
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I love to serve you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not,</v>

334
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a sycophant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

335
00:14:18.041 --> 00:14:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I went there and spend time with</v>

336
00:14:20.141 --> 00:14:22.390
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the moment I know that I was</v>

337
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:24.640
<v Speaker 1>doing what I loved was when there were a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of other people,</v>

338
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.140
<v Speaker 1>then they're all trying to get his</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

339
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:27.940
<v Speaker 1>And he and I went through this walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

340
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and this deer went by and he was telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>me about all these past presidents.</v>

341
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.510
<v Speaker 1>He was honestly at the time complaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how unfair things were.</v>

342
00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:35.980
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a pressing United States and</v>

343
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:40.981
<v Speaker 1>these F up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm 31 years old and I got to help</v>

344
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:42.070
<v Speaker 1>this bastard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

345
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.130
<v Speaker 1>And then that night he wanted me to stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was new years and I left Aspen</v>

346
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.620
<v Speaker 1>with my family and Peter and I promised</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family and come back.</v>

347
00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

348
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.410
<v Speaker 1>promised my family was present.</v>

349
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.610
<v Speaker 1>I said I'd be happy to work with in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future and I left leaving the president</v>

350
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:57.560
<v Speaker 1>when everybody else stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

351
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 1>was a moment I realize I'm doing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really supposed to do.</v>

352
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I've kept my party straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family still number one,</v>

353
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.150
<v Speaker 1>making contribution is number two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to play on the scale that's</v>

354
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.700
<v Speaker 1>global and a male playing this play</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale that matters most,</v>

355
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 1>which is local and family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be a moment that</v>

356
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:12.350
<v Speaker 1>sticks out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to spend a lot of time on</v>

357
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but since you brought up the subject of</v>

358
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:17.000
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask you about the current</v>

359
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:17.834
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

360
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Have you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you advised him and if you haven't,</v>

361
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>how would you help him?</v>

362
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Brain transplant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

363
00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:35.120
<v Speaker 1>just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the president quite well.</v>

364
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I've known for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave him his first big speech I'm,</v>

365
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I might be to blame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote about in his book,</v>

366
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 1>he thought he was coming to speak to 200</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in my seminar with 10,000 people.</v>

367
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 1>And you just kind of lost it a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

368
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then his number one piece of</v>

369
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 1>feedback on how to succeed was get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prenup.</v>

370
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

371
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.730
<v Speaker 1>And I know Mrs. Clark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Know Mrs. Clinton very well as well.</v>

372
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:56.564
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

373
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I had a great difficulty in this last</v>
<v Speaker 1>election because I felt like both</v>

374
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 1>parties lied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's extremely hard.</v>

375
00:16:03.621 --> 00:16:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody goes white lights,</v>

376
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 1>but some were pretty exaggerated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously on both sides.</v>

377
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought it was a more difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

378
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I help people on both sides of the</v>

379
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:12.080
<v Speaker 1>aisle.</v>

380
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't talk about it and way help</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they talk about it publicly.</v>

381
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Clinton is shared,</v>

382
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:18.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called me one day and said,</v>

383
00:16:18.401 --> 00:16:19.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I got the overhead speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president's calling them in my</v>

385
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>offices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big offices in two floors.</v>

386
00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I went to the pickup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stone,</v>

387
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 1>and sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the secretary and the presence</v>

388
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 1>waiting and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

389
00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna impeach me in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should I do?</v>

390
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you call me sooner</v>

391
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.650
<v Speaker 1>morning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

392
00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.160
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

393
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

394
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:42.770
<v Speaker 1>what should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

395
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:45.110
<v Speaker 1>the answer is not what should they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're asking the wrong question.</v>

396
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.060
<v Speaker 1>The first question you gonna ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

397
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you want parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moms,</v>

398
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:54.320
<v Speaker 1>dads to have their kids look up to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you want him to stay in office?</v>

399
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different outcome.</v>

400
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to stay in the office,</v>

401
00:16:57.621 --> 00:16:58.431
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy for me.</v>

402
00:16:58.431 --> 00:16:59.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a lawyer and I'm not in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

403
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:02.480
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to get thrown out of</v>

404
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:04.250
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many votes on your side.</v>

405
00:17:04.251 --> 00:17:06.110
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to stay an office if be do</v>

406
00:17:06.111 --> 00:17:07.490
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I said,</v>

407
00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:09.560
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to be respected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

408
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.930
<v Speaker 1>you can share the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a lawyer without putting yourself</v>

409
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:13.990
<v Speaker 1>at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And still get more of the truth out.</v>

410
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.020
<v Speaker 1>And we had a great conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's near.</v>

411
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.290
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I do.</v>

412
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.210
<v Speaker 1>So I'll call you back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll call you back in 20 minutes,</v>

413
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:24.170
<v Speaker 1>some weight and 2030 45 and an hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>later secretary calls me and says,</v>

414
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.240
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] want you to know he's still</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolving things.</v>

415
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 1>He wants to get back to you.</v>

416
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:31.460
<v Speaker 1>And then another 30 minutes went by and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking like an effecting history here,</v>

417
00:17:31.461 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw him standing with all the</v>

418
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Democrats beside him to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

419
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.730
<v Speaker 1>we're doing to kind of keep this theme</v>
<v Speaker 1>component and went through things.</v>

420
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:40.820
<v Speaker 1>So over the years I've had the chance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work with people on all sides.</v>

421
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.790
<v Speaker 1>And what I think about the current</v>
<v Speaker 1>president is he's terrible communicator.</v>

422
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:45.410
<v Speaker 1>But I think he actually has some good</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

423
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.800
<v Speaker 1>And I also think he's communicated so</v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly in our world is so,</v>

424
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.410
<v Speaker 1>but now anything he says is seen through</v>
<v Speaker 1>that filter.</v>

425
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 1>If I think you are the nicest man in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

426
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.960
<v Speaker 1>it totally controls my experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

427
00:17:57.961 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my belief.</v>

428
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.760
<v Speaker 1>If you treat me mean one day and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>best friends,</v>

429
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're having a bad day,</v>

430
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can't resolve it with you and who's</v>

431
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:07.800
<v Speaker 1>ever had a bad day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look,</v>

432
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:10.080
<v Speaker 1>somebody else thought that about you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just having a bad day,</v>

433
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:10.970
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

434
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I think you're a manipulative</v>

435
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.400
<v Speaker 1>bastard and I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe it and you don't treat me</v>

436
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:21.120
<v Speaker 1>me and you treat me real nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the first question in our mind?</v>

437
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:24.810
<v Speaker 1>What does he want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your questions,</v>

438
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 1>your belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your emotion or your experience has</v>

439
00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:29.190
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shaped by what you believe in.</v>

440
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Most of you believe what you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by enduring interacting with these</v>

441
00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 1>people personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it through the media and</v>

442
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:37.380
<v Speaker 1>the media is a great component that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's soundbites.</v>

443
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 1>And let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no longer about informing you.</v>

444
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.430
<v Speaker 1>It's about startling you in farming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will never get your attention.</v>

445
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 1>There's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got oceans,</v>

446
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say that we're living in an</v>

447
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 1>information society that's total</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

448
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.230
<v Speaker 1>The information society died a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

449
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're drowning in information,</v>

450
00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 1>we're starving for wisdom.</v>

451
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.710
<v Speaker 1>And what we get now are sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now people don't,</v>

452
00:18:58.711 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not news anymore on both sides of</v>

453
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:03.720
<v Speaker 1>the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People basically pretended snooze when</v>

454
00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:05.670
<v Speaker 1>it's all commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your perception,</v>

455
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like I just had lunch recently with</v>
<v Speaker 1>George W.</v>

456
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought them out to speak to a,</v>

457
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.290
<v Speaker 1>a group of my funding groups and I bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>up people on both sides of the aisle.</v>

458
00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 1>And this year we're working with has an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama so you could get him in,</v>

459
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Speaker 1>but to give you an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people their thought they were more</v>

460
00:19:19.381 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 1>liberal and they were like thinking like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is evil.</v>

461
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.360
<v Speaker 1>And after two hours of conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't a person that you're like,</v>

462
00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:27.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that right.</v>

463
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.970
<v Speaker 1>They really liked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like I was getting on as decisions</v>

464
00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:32.310
<v Speaker 1>and they got to see why he made the</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions he did.</v>

465
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.950
<v Speaker 1>And when you see the why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of all the bullshit you hear and</v>

466
00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the generalizations that he's an evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

467
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:37.980
<v Speaker 1>you start to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

468
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I might've made a different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different incentive.</v>

469
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I might not have without information</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had at that time.</v>

470
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I asked him about the current president</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was still during the election</v>

471
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:46.370
<v Speaker 1>when this is occurring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

472
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I know you wanted your brother</v>

473
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:50.160
<v Speaker 1>to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I admired person Bush for never</v>

474
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:52.440
<v Speaker 1>attacking the past present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never attacked President Obama.</v>

475
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:54.090
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a class act even when he</v>

476
00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:56.400
<v Speaker 1>disagreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he told me privately what he felt.</v>

477
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.860
<v Speaker 1>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

478
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Nixon was elected and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

479
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the end of the American</v>

480
00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:04.680
<v Speaker 1>presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

481
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.580
<v Speaker 1>the pressing United States is God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

482
00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the wrong thing.</v>

483
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.700
<v Speaker 1>And he said he didn't destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't.</v>

484
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what I figured out.</v>

485
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.820
<v Speaker 1>The office is bigger than the occupant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really believe that's true.</v>

486
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I think if you want to go home tonight</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a little bit of comfort inside,</v>

487
00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:21.480
<v Speaker 1>go back to that truth.</v>

488
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.090
<v Speaker 1>The office is bigger than the occupant</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see it when he does things.</v>

489
00:20:24.091 --> 00:20:26.220
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a judicial branch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>balances it.</v>

490
00:20:26.221 --> 00:20:28.590
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we're in a situation where</v>

491
00:20:28.591 --> 00:20:32.250
<v Speaker 1>the biggest challenge we have as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>society is we demonize the other side on</v>

492
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:33.320
<v Speaker 1>almost every issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

493
00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.530
<v Speaker 1>They used to be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

494
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:37.500
<v Speaker 1>congressmen and senators would go fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>like crazy on the floor and then they go</v>

495
00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 1>have a beer together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now your radioactive,</v>

496
00:20:39.661 --> 00:20:41.800
<v Speaker 1>if you talk to somebody and that's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

497
00:20:41.801 --> 00:20:44.730
<v Speaker 1>I met Mr Gorbachev,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a chance to fly him for four and</v>

498
00:20:44.731 --> 00:20:47.170
<v Speaker 1>half hours and I asked him what ended</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cold War and he said at the end of</v>

499
00:20:47.171 --> 00:20:49.420
<v Speaker 1>demonization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said it used to be you guys were</v>

500
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:51.340
<v Speaker 1>attacking us and everything he did was</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

501
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.650
<v Speaker 1>We were the evil empire and we knew you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were evil.</v>

502
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:56.500
<v Speaker 1>And he said one day said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting there with President</v>

503
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was lecturing me and he said,</v>

504
00:20:58.481 --> 00:21:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I could feel the anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could feel my face burning red.</v>

505
00:21:01.231 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I was so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said to him,</v>

506
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 1>you are not my teacher and I am not your</v>
<v Speaker 1>student and you will not lecture me.</v>

507
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:07.750
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I lectured him.</v>

508
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm able some capital.</v>

509
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I remember going back and forth and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

510
00:21:12.091 --> 00:21:13.350
<v Speaker 1>so that's one of the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

511
00:21:13.351 --> 00:21:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really great answer,</v>

512
00:21:14.431 --> 00:21:16.710
<v Speaker 1>but I'm with you for four hours and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to know the moment.</v>

513
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.140
<v Speaker 1>What's the moment I'm spending this time</v>
<v Speaker 1>with history?</v>

514
00:21:19.141 --> 00:21:20.490
<v Speaker 1>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what changed the world?</v>

515
00:21:20.491 --> 00:21:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Because most of us forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably take away terrorism.</v>

516
00:21:24.121 --> 00:21:29.121
<v Speaker 1>Terrorism is nothing compared to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of nuclear salt the USSR and the</v>

517
00:21:29.341 --> 00:21:33.060
<v Speaker 1>US had at that stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest change we've had and he thought</v>

518
00:21:33.061 --> 00:21:35.170
<v Speaker 1>from old talking mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He showed this great moment with bay,</v>

519
00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.780
<v Speaker 1>said he hit his leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking to the interpreter,</v>

520
00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:39.750
<v Speaker 1>but he recognized us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why the English,</v>

521
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.270
<v Speaker 1>he's smacking his legging giggling like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little kid.</v>

522
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.030
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will tell you the moment he said we</v>

523
00:21:45.031 --> 00:21:47.730
<v Speaker 1>were having this fight back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth,</v>

524
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.710
<v Speaker 1>was lecturing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was lecturing me and you all of a</v>

525
00:21:49.711 --> 00:21:51.660
<v Speaker 1>sudden you just stood up like this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

526
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.890
<v Speaker 1>this is not working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He turned and walked three steps away</v>

527
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.380
<v Speaker 1>and he turned back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we start fresh?</v>

528
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.850
<v Speaker 3>My name is Rod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to have that same impact they did on</v>

529
00:22:04.851 --> 00:22:06.350
<v Speaker 3>you this now he said he was laughing</v>

530
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.363
<v Speaker 1>uncontrollable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

531
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.040
<v Speaker 1>I knew I could do business with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

532
00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:11.080
<v Speaker 1>You have the love the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Minnie said,</v>

533
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Reagan also knew the Gorbachev loves</v>
<v Speaker 1>children and there were no children</v>

534
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:17.110
<v Speaker 1>going to go to the USSR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

535
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.890
<v Speaker 1>So the union and Reagan brought a group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of children over and let them be in the</v>

536
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:24.410
<v Speaker 1>care of Gorbachev and he said the</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely changed the game for him.</v>

537
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.160
<v Speaker 1>So it was a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a moment of breaking someone's</v>

538
00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.190
<v Speaker 1>pattern and that works in an intimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

539
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.340
<v Speaker 1>It works in a business challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also works out of scale of</v>

540
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 1>society in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to audience questions and I</v>

541
00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:38.080
<v Speaker 1>hope you all had sent some to the iconic</v>
<v Speaker 1>tour Hashtag.</v>

542
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to those in just a sec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

543
00:22:39.881 --> 00:22:43.180
<v Speaker 1>but from politics back to to</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial is in the</v>

544
00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:45.850
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've built businesses,</v>

545
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 1>you've faced business challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have talked to people like the</v>

546
00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:51.190
<v Speaker 1>people in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs.</v>

547
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.360
<v Speaker 1>What do they ask you most and what do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell them?</v>

548
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time seems to be the largest issue.</v>

549
00:22:59.951 --> 00:23:03.040
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have time issues and run</v>
<v Speaker 1>your business having to have a life and</v>

550
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:04.600
<v Speaker 1>your time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he show hands out there who feels</v>

551
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:06.900
<v Speaker 1>like that's there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see it's about nine years ago</v>

552
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.130
<v Speaker 1>and some people are just too tired to</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise their hand.</v>

553
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.380
<v Speaker 3>But the issue of time is not</v>

554
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.290
<v Speaker 1>the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real issue is that they're operating</v>

555
00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:18.610
<v Speaker 1>as an operator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not an owner.</v>

556
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.310
<v Speaker 1>And so when I start to do in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning you have to do both,</v>

557
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I start to do is show them how</v>

558
00:23:23.711 --> 00:23:25.990
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to break off and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people to do things.</v>

559
00:23:25.991 --> 00:23:27.670
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I teach people.</v>

560
00:23:27.671 --> 00:23:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

561
00:23:28.601 --> 00:23:31.250
<v Speaker 1>a five day bootcamp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called business mastery with a couple</v>

562
00:23:31.251 --> 00:23:33.760
<v Speaker 1>of times a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we bring in businesses from all over</v>

563
00:23:33.761 --> 00:23:34.421
<v Speaker 1>the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>

564
00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:36.610
<v Speaker 1>And we have people just starting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and we have people with,</v>

565
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something they're doing a</v>

566
00:23:37.781 --> 00:23:39.010
<v Speaker 1>billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2,000,000,003.</v>

567
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.000
<v Speaker 1>And what you find is that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>common pattern amongst all these group</v>

568
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:47.690
<v Speaker 1>of people where they find if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a small business,</v>

569
00:23:47.691 --> 00:23:50.300
<v Speaker 1>they do everything because they figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that was the only one can do it or</v>

570
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:51.750
<v Speaker 1>they tried someone else and they fail.</v>

571
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 1>But that happens in every business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to begin to leverage yourself</v>

572
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.510
<v Speaker 1>or you're just going to be self employed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll never have the scalability.</v>

573
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:04.570
<v Speaker 1>A business is a system that adds value</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when you're not there and you as a</v>

574
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:08.480
<v Speaker 1>leader have to get good enough to both</v>
<v Speaker 1>hire people and train people so that</v>

575
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.720
<v Speaker 1>you're not a manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A manager works with people to make sure</v>

576
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 1>they get the job done while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

577
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.910
<v Speaker 1>but if you have to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cry run 33 companies.</v>

578
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean every four days I'm on a plane</v>
<v Speaker 1>train helicopter on stage,</v>

579
00:24:19.911 --> 00:24:22.940
<v Speaker 1>somewhere on average in a year and I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>33 companies.</v>

580
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:26.780
<v Speaker 1>There's 12 I managed directly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't do that by management.</v>

581
00:24:26.781 --> 00:24:29.810
<v Speaker 1>I do it by leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I build leaders who can make their own</v>

582
00:24:29.811 --> 00:24:31.880
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hire people that are the best of the</v>

583
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:32.360
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

584
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Now in the beginning that's hard cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no money,</v>

585
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you hire the best,</v>

586
00:24:35.931 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 1>it's called you and you pay them</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

587
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.090
<v Speaker 1>And then now you try to hire other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and what do you do?</v>

588
00:24:41.091 --> 00:24:43.550
<v Speaker 1>You hire your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you know is a disaster because</v>

589
00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:46.130
<v Speaker 1>they're not as skilled and you love them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to manage them.</v>

590
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.430
<v Speaker 1>And then I hired people that were really</v>
<v Speaker 1>talented but they were mean.</v>

591
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't share my values.</v>

592
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 1>And so eventually you get to that place</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can find the right people.</v>

593
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:58.130
<v Speaker 1>But I think the most important secret</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the growth of any business,</v>

594
00:24:58.131 --> 00:24:59.690
<v Speaker 1>and the question that got us on how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go over the time,</v>

595
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is you've got to take two</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

596
00:25:01.941 --> 00:25:04.280
<v Speaker 1>many minutes a week with your team of</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

597
00:25:04.281 --> 00:25:04.941
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

598
00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:07.850
<v Speaker 1>2000 and you got to meet where you work</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the business.</v>

599
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.660
<v Speaker 1>And I teach people a format called seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven where there's seven areas of a</v>

600
00:25:11.661 --> 00:25:13.610
<v Speaker 1>business that you cannot miss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marketing,</v>

601
00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:15.980
<v Speaker 1>sales optimization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the financials,</v>

602
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.560
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll make sure that each week you</v>

603
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:21.020
<v Speaker 1>and your team focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not been bathed in a business.</v>

604
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:24.350
<v Speaker 1>But how do we strengthen our marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just for this run,</v>

605
00:25:24.351 --> 00:25:27.080
<v Speaker 1>but overall how we build the brand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do we do to change our sales</v>

606
00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:28.880
<v Speaker 1>process?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we optimize the business?</v>

607
00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:32.240
<v Speaker 1>How do we spend no money and grow the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business 30% in the next three to six</v>

608
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:34.790
<v Speaker 1>months?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you take small markers in the</v>

609
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:37.550
<v Speaker 1>business that are critical and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve them five,</v>

610
00:25:37.551 --> 00:25:42.160
<v Speaker 1>10 15% that you do 12 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll grow your business 120 130% and</v>

611
00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 1>40% because there's a compounding</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact.</v>

612
00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:46.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't just get the improvement</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've made.</v>

613
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.920
<v Speaker 1>So I try to help businesses to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>those changes so that,</v>

614
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 1>so you have time to think and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategic.</v>

615
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're just running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you are stressed?</v>

616
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest.</v>

617
00:25:55.311 --> 00:25:58.070
<v Speaker 1>If you had today being here and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being at your business,</v>

618
00:25:58.071 --> 00:25:59.930
<v Speaker 1>how many pills?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some stress in your business being away</v>

619
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:01.130
<v Speaker 1>even for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

620
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:02.690
<v Speaker 1>write down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a business operator.</v>

621
00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:05.690
<v Speaker 1>F that I'm going to come a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>owner.</v>

622
00:26:05.691 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

623
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to a question from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

624
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would the 13 year old version of</v>

625
00:26:11.691 --> 00:26:16.691
<v Speaker 1>yourself say to you today with</v>
<v Speaker 1>conviction and be flat wrong about,</v>

626
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.650
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get a 30 year old.</v>

627
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.143
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

628
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.920
<v Speaker 1>he's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's not gonna say shit today.</v>

629
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I buried him a long time ago was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifth 57.</v>

630
00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

631
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the 30 year old would say,</v>

632
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:38.690
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're going to do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

633
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.350
<v Speaker 1>And it would be these huge numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I develop a principle around the</v>

634
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:46.920
<v Speaker 1>time I was 30 is most of us overestimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>work we're going to do in a year.</v>

635
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 1>And we underestimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do in a decade and a</v>

636
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.080
<v Speaker 1>decade happens that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll blink,</v>

637
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:54.870
<v Speaker 1>your eyes will be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I really,</v>

638
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:55.560
<v Speaker 1>truly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

639
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.840
<v Speaker 1>everything I do as long term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the biggest challenge we</v>

640
00:26:57.841 --> 00:27:01.710
<v Speaker 1>have in your corporate America is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for the next quarter instead of,</v>

641
00:27:01.711 --> 00:27:02.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best business people,</v>

642
00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:04.630
<v Speaker 1>the Marc Benioff's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Steve Wynn's.</v>

643
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Peter Guber is and people that I hang</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

644
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.920
<v Speaker 1>they all are decade long people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was 14 I said,</v>

645
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>this is how my life's going to go.</v>

646
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat in my twenties I'm going to help.</v>

647
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I want to have the skill to help anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed their lives.</v>

648
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 1>If I'm committed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're committed,</v>

649
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be done a hobby ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got to build to that,</v>

650
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:24.360
<v Speaker 1>which I did and I said in my thirties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 14 I said,</v>

651
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that with groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a one on one and then in my</v>

652
00:27:27.331 --> 00:27:30.300
<v Speaker 1>forties I'll do a big groups in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties I'll do it with companies and my</v>

653
00:27:30.301 --> 00:27:32.580
<v Speaker 1>six p's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll either do it in government as a</v>

654
00:27:32.581 --> 00:27:35.760
<v Speaker 1>servant there or in a religious context</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm a spiritual person.</v>

655
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:37.320
<v Speaker 1>But I don't tell people what to believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>religiously.</v>

656
00:27:37.321 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 1>But at that point I've lived long</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

657
00:27:38.611 --> 00:27:40.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe a well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well do you have a run for office,</v>

658
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.360
<v Speaker 1>a Iul?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've said yes.</v>

659
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Now the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've served on both sides of the island.</v>

660
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not really about the office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about fundraising right now.</v>

661
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 1>So much of the time I would not do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless I ran with in my own money on,</v>

662
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:52.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a small number of friends.</v>

663
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 1>But at this stage I think it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupt my wife's life so much.</v>

664
00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very public person and she's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I feel bad for her.</v>

665
00:27:59.191 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that would be right.</v>

666
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to Jeff Collins question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If mindset is the key or a key,</v>

667
00:28:04.991 --> 00:28:08.590
<v Speaker 2>how do you shift your mindset?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to ask a question that's</v>

668
00:28:08.591 --> 00:28:13.150
<v Speaker 2>related to that and that is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're now,</v>

669
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:16.450
<v Speaker 2>but when you say your top of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're a confident guy,</v>

670
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.580
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do when you have self doubt</v>

671
00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:25.630
<v Speaker 2>and that's sort of how your mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you deal with self doubt.</v>

672
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.160
<v Speaker 2>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a lot of it at this stage,</v>

673
00:28:28.161 --> 00:28:31.150
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's shocking.</v>

674
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm being honest.</v>

675
00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I think self doubt is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

676
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.850
<v Speaker 1>instead of self doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say questioning.</v>

677
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's critical to question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certain stages.</v>

678
00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:45.940
<v Speaker 1>If you're questioning all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have nothing but fear and doubt,</v>

679
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only believe something cause you</v>

680
00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:49.420
<v Speaker 1>don't question it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

681
00:28:49.421 --> 00:28:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Someone tells me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh so and so talked behind your back</v>

682
00:28:51.521 --> 00:28:52.121
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'd go,</v>

683
00:28:52.121 --> 00:28:53.800
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're my friend maybe ever do that.</v>

684
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Your belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your certain,</v>

685
00:28:55.421 --> 00:28:57.040
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to do it so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even entertain it.</v>

686
00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.410
<v Speaker 1>But if two or three people tell you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>

687
00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.131
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good John,</v>

688
00:29:00.131 --> 00:29:02.190
<v Speaker 1>really be doing this by my back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

689
00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 1>and you start questioning it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever done that?</v>

690
00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.310
<v Speaker 1>You've been upset with somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you confront them and then you find out</v>

691
00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:07.900
<v Speaker 1>it's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do anything wrong and you</v>

692
00:29:07.901 --> 00:29:09.400
<v Speaker 1>feel like an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

693
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.890
<v Speaker 1>so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a time to question.</v>

694
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.740
<v Speaker 1>And so I organized that when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning something,</v>

695
00:29:14.741 --> 00:29:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my investments is a perfect example,</v>

696
00:29:16.841 --> 00:29:17.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

697
00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.420
<v Speaker 1>if you look at somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

698
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

699
00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:24.580
<v Speaker 1>like Richard Branson for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard is this giant risk taker,</v>

700
00:29:24.581 --> 00:29:26.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he questioned,</v>

701
00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:28.990
<v Speaker 1>he's got one question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he questions within himself and everyone</v>

702
00:29:28.991 --> 00:29:31.090
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are we gonna protect the downside?</v>

703
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.160
<v Speaker 1>It's his number one question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never believe it.</v>

704
00:29:33.161 --> 00:29:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Cause I got risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His life when it comes to investments in</v>

705
00:29:35.051 --> 00:29:36.160
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't risk anything.</v>

706
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.350
<v Speaker 1>When he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me I was building virgin,</v>

707
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.800
<v Speaker 1>he's taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm British airlands and it's giant</v>

708
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.220
<v Speaker 1>outright at capitol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this could literally bankrupt I</v>

709
00:29:44.221 --> 00:29:46.570
<v Speaker 1>and everybody said it would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

710
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.220
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to protect the downside.</v>

711
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.350
<v Speaker 1>And he negotiated with Boeing for a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half and convinced them that if he</v>

712
00:29:53.351 --> 00:29:55.690
<v Speaker 1>went out of business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was wrong and lost his business in</v>

713
00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 1>the first two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could get back all the jabs and have</v>

714
00:29:58.091 --> 00:29:59.410
<v Speaker 1>no liability whatsoever.</v>

715
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 1>So his whole focus is asymmetrical risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>

716
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 1>How do I take the least risk with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most upside?</v>

717
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.110
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go entrepreneurs in this room,</v>

718
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 1>the illusion that you've been taught is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that great entrepreneurs take giant</v>

719
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:14.020
<v Speaker 1>risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's total bullshit.</v>

720
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 1>There are some exceptions that have and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gotten lucky,</v>

721
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently succeed,</v>

722
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.540
<v Speaker 1>they know the upside will take care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

723
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:24.460
<v Speaker 1>They focus on how to protect the</v>
<v Speaker 1>downside.</v>

724
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:28.210
<v Speaker 1>And they take risks where they know I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a limited risk for an unlimited</v>

725
00:30:28.211 --> 00:30:29.350
<v Speaker 1>upside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm wrong,</v>

726
00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:30.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm still okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

727
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I worked with Paul Tudor Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the top 10 traders in the history</v>

728
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:35.800
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Paul,</v>

729
00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've coached now for 24 years.</v>

730
00:30:37.811 --> 00:30:40.360
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't lost money in those 24 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>on his own personal training.</v>

731
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.350
<v Speaker 1>And during that time I've learned so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much from him and the biggest thing I</v>

732
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.010
<v Speaker 1>learned from him was this asymmetrical</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk reward that when he risks a dollar,</v>

733
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.560
<v Speaker 1>he wants to be certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to make five where he doesn't</v>

734
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 1>rest of the doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must be worth a dollar to make 10% or</v>

735
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:55.720
<v Speaker 1>20% you won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

736
00:30:55.721 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go broke because here's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>

737
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.830
<v Speaker 1>You risk a dollar to try to make five</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're wrong,</v>

738
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:01.330
<v Speaker 1>risk another dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you win,</v>

739
00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:04.720
<v Speaker 1>you still win big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be wrong four to five times and</v>

740
00:31:04.721 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 1>still break even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the best in the world do it.</v>

741
00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:11.140
<v Speaker 1>They don't do it by taking these</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic risks where everything's on the</v>

742
00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:12.730
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it doesn't go perfectly,</v>

743
00:31:12.731 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 1>you're out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why most businesses go out.</v>

744
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Speaker 1>You want to think of asymmetrical risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward</v>

745
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.470
<v Speaker 2>tutor Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>curiously as an aside,</v>

746
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:22.500
<v Speaker 2>was a classmate of mine at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>University of Virginia.</v>

747
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:23.423
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

748
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I met him there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would never remember it,</v>

749
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.640
<v Speaker 2>but a but a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

750
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.800
<v Speaker 2>another aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you mentioned that he's a hedge</v>

751
00:31:30.801 --> 00:31:35.660
<v Speaker 2>fund manager in Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You did a brilliant interview with Ray</v>

752
00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Dalio for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was facebook not long ago.</v>

753
00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.940
<v Speaker 2>And his book is really terrific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called principles.</v>

754
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I recommend you all go get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

755
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:44.650
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the greatest business books</v>

756
00:31:44.651 --> 00:31:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I've ever read because if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

757
00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:48.800
<v Speaker 1>ray is in most of you know Warren</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buffet.</v>

758
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 1>That's because Warren buffet is sweet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shares and is public nature.</v>

759
00:31:52.691 --> 00:31:56.110
<v Speaker 1>But Ray is actually most successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>investor of its type in the history of</v>

760
00:31:56.111 --> 00:31:58.240
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's returned more money to investors</v>

761
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.190
<v Speaker 1>and the Hedge Fund perspective than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody in history.</v>

762
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.720
<v Speaker 1>When I met Ray now 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had of a $5 billion net worth for</v>

763
00:32:04.721 --> 00:32:06.970
<v Speaker 1>him to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't be a billionaire that's too</v>

764
00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:09.460
<v Speaker 1>weak and you got to give them 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>million to start.</v>

765
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won't take your money no matter who</v>

766
00:32:10.901 --> 00:32:12.280
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I went to go interview him the</v>

767
00:32:12.281 --> 00:32:14.800
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prime minister of China was talking</v>

768
00:32:14.801 --> 00:32:16.720
<v Speaker 1>to him the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was coaching China on what to do with</v>

769
00:32:16.721 --> 00:32:17.050
<v Speaker 1>their money.</v>

770
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.970
<v Speaker 1>That's how brilliant his hedge fund</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

771
00:32:18.971 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're familiar with rich people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them money.</v>

772
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Hedge Fund's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be,</v>

773
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:23.980
<v Speaker 1>let's say 20 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 160 billion,</v>

774
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.070
<v Speaker 1>but go get his book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He flew down to palm beach and my home</v>

775
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.870
<v Speaker 1>and it's called principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

776
00:32:28.871 --> 00:32:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I want you to be the first person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview me and do it on,</v>

777
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.530
<v Speaker 1>on facebook live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did,</v>

778
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:36.430
<v Speaker 1>but I love this man and he will show you</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we built from nothing.</v>

779
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.800
<v Speaker 1>You literally started with nothing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he worked as a caddy.</v>

780
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started when he was 26 years old and</v>

781
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.380
<v Speaker 1>a two bedroom apartment and now he's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>1800 employees,</v>

782
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 1>160 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 100 richest men in the world and</v>

783
00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:49.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the top 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go meet.</v>

784
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 1>But his insights about how to run a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

785
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.160
<v Speaker 1>how to run your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all need principles to guide our</v>

786
00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:55.730
<v Speaker 1>decision making.</v>

787
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.580
<v Speaker 1>If you really think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>success is the result of good judgment,</v>

788
00:32:58.581 --> 00:33:00.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make great decisions,</v>

789
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.610
<v Speaker 1>you're going to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But where does good judgement comes</v>

790
00:33:03.611 --> 00:33:04.820
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

791
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:05.803
<v Speaker 1>good judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

792
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Often comes from experience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience often comes from bad</v>

793
00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:09.950
<v Speaker 1>judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

794
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 1>So what I found is the way to speed it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

795
00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.860
<v Speaker 1>way to have less of that bad judgment is</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of a,</v>

796
00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:17.510
<v Speaker 1>think about that for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

797
00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:18.890
<v Speaker 1>All good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

798
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:22.100
<v Speaker 1>So I found that the way to speed it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not learned through my own</v>

799
00:33:22.101 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but learn by modeling.</v>

800
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Others compress decades into days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can get an erase head,</v>

801
00:33:27.141 --> 00:33:28.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised in a very private man through</v>

802
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Larry Decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

803
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.650
<v Speaker 1>he's 68 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good friend and he's entering a</v>

804
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:36.830
<v Speaker 1>stage where he now wants to go public</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a short time,</v>

805
00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:40.400
<v Speaker 1>give everybody knows and then disappear</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he feels an obligation to give</v>

806
00:33:40.401 --> 00:33:43.310
<v Speaker 1>back to the society and human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have helped him to again.</v>

807
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:47.750
<v Speaker 1>So go pick it up and it'll be fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had them at another event and he</v>

808
00:33:47.751 --> 00:33:50.950
<v Speaker 1>talks about this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of radical transparency and yes,</v>

809
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.390
<v Speaker 1>how he runs his business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different,</v>

810
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:54.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure it would work for every</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

811
00:33:54.831 --> 00:33:57.550
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly worked for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to uh,</v>

812
00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set Torrie's question,</v>

813
00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:03.740
<v Speaker 1>but so many people wanting your help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the factors for you to select</v>

814
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.040
<v Speaker 1>who you privately train or mentor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said you're a busy guy,</v>

815
00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:13.040
<v Speaker 1>you've got a time management thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of people would like a</v>

816
00:34:13.041 --> 00:34:18.041
<v Speaker 1>piece of Tony Robbins mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you decide who whom you are going</v>

817
00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:18.801
<v Speaker 1>to help?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

818
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:21.540
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to do things online.</v>

819
00:34:21.541 --> 00:34:21.831
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

820
00:34:21.831 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a zillion things on youtube,</v>

821
00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:26.510
<v Speaker 1>so no one has to spend any money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who wants to be inspired to do</v>

822
00:34:26.511 --> 00:34:26.901
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they only,</v>

823
00:34:26.901 --> 00:34:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't like about that is it's random.</v>

824
00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm a system guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know how to take you from here to</v>

825
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:33.290
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have products that can do that for</v>

826
00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:34.730
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they have events and the events</v>

827
00:34:34.731 --> 00:34:36.380
<v Speaker 1>have gotten bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we do 10,</v>

828
00:34:36.381 --> 00:34:38.680
<v Speaker 1>14,000 people in a weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

829
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.160
<v Speaker 1>and so anybody can go who I coach or</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that I know by touching them,</v>

830
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I can touch millions more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I work with a Marc Benioff at</v>

831
00:34:46.911 --> 00:34:47.870
<v Speaker 1>salesforce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

832
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:49.880
<v Speaker 1>in the early days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark sat in the front row,</v>

833
00:34:49.881 --> 00:34:51.720
<v Speaker 1>came to three of my same seminars in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>row,</v>

834
00:34:51.721 --> 00:34:52.554
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

835
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:54.020
<v Speaker 1>are you new?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a little slow?</v>

836
00:34:54.021 --> 00:34:54.854
<v Speaker 1>As a teaser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there</v>

837
00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.910
<v Speaker 1>marches as big as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stands up and I'm looking at this</v>

838
00:34:58.911 --> 00:34:59.744
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I die.</v>

839
00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:00.261
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

840
00:35:00.261 --> 00:35:02.270
<v Speaker 1>my name is Marc Benioff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of you,</v>

841
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:03.440
<v Speaker 1>you finally pushed me over the edge.</v>

842
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna Start my own business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaving Oracle,</v>

843
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:08.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna Start this company called</v>
<v Speaker 1>salesforce.com and he said,</v>

844
00:35:08.271 --> 00:35:09.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you mark my words,</v>

845
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:11.360
<v Speaker 1>we're going to change business around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

846
00:35:11.361 --> 00:35:13.490
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do $100 million in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

847
00:35:13.491 --> 00:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this year he's going to do 10 billion.</v>

848
00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's grown a little bit,</v>

849
00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.350
<v Speaker 1>but when you're around people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to see what the distinctions are</v>

850
00:35:21.351 --> 00:35:23.360
<v Speaker 1>that separate people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to see what,</v>

851
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:25.610
<v Speaker 1>what makes them stand out and buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coaching him,</v>

852
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to affect everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only all of him and his employees</v>

853
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.070
<v Speaker 1>because he's that kind of owner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

854
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:33.820
<v Speaker 1>He's a leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also he's a leader in the social,</v>

855
00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social community.</v>

856
00:35:34.871 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 1>He's very conscious about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody from facebook,</v>

857
00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:40.880
<v Speaker 1>the apple to Ge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back end is salesforce.</v>

858
00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So impacting him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

859
00:35:42.411 --> 00:35:44.880
<v Speaker 1>some of the other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe by just picked people who I</v>

860
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:46.860
<v Speaker 1>feel the need is and somebody stops me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the street,</v>

861
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife will tell you I can't not help</v>

862
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 1>and I got to help someone that I may</v>
<v Speaker 1>have limited time.</v>

863
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:53.610
<v Speaker 1>So then I'll invite them in a seminar or</v>
<v Speaker 1>send them a book or a package or</v>

864
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 1>something so I can give them a guide to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the next level.</v>

865
00:35:56.011 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 1>So I don't ever say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't coach everybody one on one.</v>

866
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.420
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to do it in groups where</v>

867
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:03.900
<v Speaker 2>there was a wonderful anecdote I read</v>
<v Speaker 2>since you brought up Marc Benihoff that</v>

868
00:36:03.901 --> 00:36:05.610
<v Speaker 2>I guess he was a guest at one of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>bed,</v>

869
00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:10.590
<v Speaker 2>your home or resort in Fiji and middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the night you get he and all of the</v>

870
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.970
<v Speaker 2>other guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

871
00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.430
<v Speaker 2>it goes to the question of how do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome your fears?</v>

872
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Tell that story about Benny Hoff jumping</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the river river and what you didn't</v>

873
00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:21.090
<v Speaker 2>tell him about the river.</v>

874
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I have a home in Fiji.</v>

875
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I've been going there since I was 2124</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

876
00:36:25.801 --> 00:36:28.890
<v Speaker 1>So my favorite places in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people there are extraordinary.</v>

877
00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:33.060
<v Speaker 1>You're carried as a child every day for</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months by someone 24 seven so we</v>

878
00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:34.350
<v Speaker 1>talked about raising them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

879
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 1>being raised by a village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

880
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 1>They're on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sing in four part harmony when</v>

881
00:36:37.651 --> 00:36:39.210
<v Speaker 1>they're four years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I went there,</v>

882
00:36:39.211 --> 00:36:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I was touched by it and I went explored</v>
<v Speaker 1>this island and I was with this chief</v>

883
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.230
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this river that goes both ways</v>

884
00:36:46.231 --> 00:36:50.100
<v Speaker 1>because it's this river where the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in and it looks like out of Africa</v>

885
00:36:50.101 --> 00:36:53.310
<v Speaker 1>or something you'd see down in South</v>
<v Speaker 1>America and eventually goes,</v>

886
00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:55.170
<v Speaker 1>ms scary looking arrogant into a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake.</v>

887
00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:58.530
<v Speaker 1>But the tide is so fast it would just</v>
<v Speaker 1>take you.</v>

888
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.740
<v Speaker 1>And then your eight hours later when</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverses and goes back out.</v>

889
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 1>So I was whipping missed one day and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

890
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.350
<v Speaker 1>are there any fish in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Ratu,</v>

891
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.730
<v Speaker 1>which is the main key points that goes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little about that.</v>

892
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.520
<v Speaker 1>And we looked back and it's a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manta rays slowly going under the</v>

893
00:37:11.521 --> 00:37:13.110
<v Speaker 1>bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

894
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 1>F it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this.</v>

895
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I just jumped in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the thing took me and it took</v>

896
00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 1>me for a wild ass ride for about 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

897
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:24.450
<v Speaker 1>I end up this lake and then dumb ass me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think about how the hell am I</v>

898
00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:26.610
<v Speaker 1>going to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so strong,</v>

899
00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't swim against this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent eight hours on this little</v>

900
00:37:29.011 --> 00:37:31.980
<v Speaker 1>island airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I came back one time with a</v>

901
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:33.600
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was nighttime and I was like,</v>

902
00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about devil rock in</v>

903
00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:37.500
<v Speaker 1>shark alley and all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

904
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 1>let's do it at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had a boat waiting for us</v>

905
00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.673
<v Speaker 3>to bring us back,</v>

906
00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was scary as hell in all the,</v>

907
00:37:45.741 --> 00:37:47.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the phosphorescence going on.</v>

908
00:37:47.201 --> 00:37:48.310
<v Speaker 1>What's like Pixie dust?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

909
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:51.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a wild experience flying fish to</v>
<v Speaker 1>scare the shit out of here.</v>

910
00:37:51.141 --> 00:37:54.140
<v Speaker 1>They come by and so when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when mark came,</v>

911
00:37:54.141 --> 00:37:55.760
<v Speaker 1>he flew over and come spend a week with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me there.</v>

912
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I took him and woke him up and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do when the tide is,</v>

913
00:37:58.161 --> 00:38:00.410
<v Speaker 1>it was like two in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I woke them all up and so I got a</v>

914
00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:01.360
<v Speaker 1>surprise for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

915
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Just trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragged them on.</v>

916
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:08.480
<v Speaker 1>You know what gear on him gave him wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>life preservers and then threw him off</v>

917
00:38:08.481 --> 00:38:11.540
<v Speaker 1>and mark was freaking out and I grabbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hand and then we'll go on three one</v>

918
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.443
<v Speaker 1>we went on one.</v>

919
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.540
<v Speaker 3>If I can feel him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's as big as I tried to jump.</v>

920
00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:20.560
<v Speaker 3>You might be hanging me out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole mum,</v>

921
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:23.510
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark talks about that story a lot.</v>

922
00:38:23.511 --> 00:38:25.730
<v Speaker 1>But overcoming fear cause you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're afraid of.</v>

923
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:27.540
<v Speaker 1>It's never as much as you're afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

924
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:28.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how many things you've been afraid</v>

925
00:38:28.641 --> 00:38:29.474
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never happened.</v>

926
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember things you do are afraid of,</v>

927
00:38:31.611 --> 00:38:33.140
<v Speaker 1>if they do happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just deal with them.</v>

928
00:38:33.141 --> 00:38:34.250
<v Speaker 1>It's that old phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

929
00:38:34.251 --> 00:38:35.590
<v Speaker 1>coward dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>1,000 deaths.</v>

930
00:38:35.591 --> 00:38:37.930
<v Speaker 1>A courageous man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only once I discipline myself,</v>

931
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:40.270
<v Speaker 1>not perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part I don't worry</v>

932
00:38:40.271 --> 00:38:41.410
<v Speaker 1>about shit til that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

933
00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:42.940
<v Speaker 1>I anticipate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't worry about it.</v>

934
00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.920
<v Speaker 1>You have stayed is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I isn't.</v>

935
00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.770
<v Speaker 1>That means state of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you stay in a great state of</v>

936
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:49.330
<v Speaker 1>mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 seven.</v>

937
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Should that even be your goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's worthwhile to have as a</v>

938
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:53.590
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's realistic.</v>

939
00:38:53.591 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 1>24 seven whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a blurbs because we all have a 2</v>

940
00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:57.933
<v Speaker 1>million year old brain.</v>

941
00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Everything's roommates that I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not designed to make you happy.</v>

942
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:05.020
<v Speaker 1>It's designed to make you survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I said to all of you right now,</v>

943
00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:08.020
<v Speaker 1>like what does that bring look for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks for what can hurt you and it</v>

944
00:39:08.021 --> 00:39:10.510
<v Speaker 1>exaggerates it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since there's no saber tooth tiger,</v>

945
00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:12.880
<v Speaker 1>now it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did people thinking of me?</v>

946
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my business make it.</v>

947
00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Do I have enough money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are all easy things to solve,</v>

948
00:39:16.841 --> 00:39:20.350
<v Speaker 1>but our reactions in our gut and when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the fear part of our mind take over</v>

949
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:23.830
<v Speaker 1>that basically if the survival software,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it runs you,</v>

950
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:25.870
<v Speaker 1>you're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a few years ago,</v>

951
00:39:25.871 --> 00:39:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I actually lecture on this now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

952
00:39:27.671 --> 00:39:29.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to skills to have the quality</v>

953
00:39:29.471 --> 00:39:31.450
<v Speaker 1>of life you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want an extraordinary life life</v>

954
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:33.220
<v Speaker 1>on your terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever your terms are,</v>

955
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.400
<v Speaker 1>he need to master the skill of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>science of achievement.</v>

956
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 1>You've got to figure out how do I take</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I dream about and make it real?</v>

957
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 1>And it's a science and you can model</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people and you can learn.</v>

958
00:39:42.491 --> 00:39:44.290
<v Speaker 1>You can speed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent my lifetime doing that.</v>

959
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:48.340
<v Speaker 1>But the second skill and the one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people don't give enough value to</v>

960
00:39:48.341 --> 00:39:50.530
<v Speaker 1>culturally is more important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

961
00:39:50.531 --> 00:39:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you knew to Allston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want an extraordinary life,</v>

962
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 1>how many people you know that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved and how many have done this?</v>

963
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Who has achieved the goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big Ole,</v>

964
00:39:56.951 --> 00:40:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you worked your ass off and you achieved</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then your brain went,</v>

965
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.650
<v Speaker 1>is this all there is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's had one of these moments?</v>

966
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everybody.</v>

967
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:07.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's worse than failing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the low achievers miss riding where I'm</v>

968
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:07.901
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you fail,</v>

969
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:08.920
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get back up,</v>

970
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:09.820
<v Speaker 1>try another approach.</v>

971
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 1>You going eventually succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it and your God if you're</v>

972
00:40:12.131 --> 00:40:16.090
<v Speaker 1>really driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you succeed in your miserable,</v>

973
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.040
<v Speaker 1>now you're what I call technically</v>
<v Speaker 1>screwed,</v>

974
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

975
00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.940
<v Speaker 1>because if you're not happy with what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got,</v>

976
00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:24.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean feeling you'd get up and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something new but succeeding,</v>

977
00:40:24.161 --> 00:40:26.950
<v Speaker 1>where do you go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I really believe you look at somebody</v>

978
00:40:26.951 --> 00:40:27.784
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

979
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like somebody like say Robin Williams.</v>

980
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I think the loss of him was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest losses we had.</v>

981
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.550
<v Speaker 1>He's loved worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ask people all over the world last year</v>

982
00:40:36.551 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 1>and China asked him in Japan and Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia throughout the US,</v>

983
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 1>how many nos people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you loved,</v>

984
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.650
<v Speaker 1>don't let you if you liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you loved Robin Williams?</v>

985
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your hands up.</v>

986
00:40:45.941 --> 00:40:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Look around the room like 98%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only 2% assholes.</v>

987
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:50.614
<v Speaker 1>That didn't like her</v>

988
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

989
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.640
<v Speaker 1>when I say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say,</v>

990
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.550
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

991
00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.860
<v Speaker 1>And so here's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he an overachiever?</v>

992
00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.020
<v Speaker 1>He came to Hollywood ever when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Hollywood,</v>

993
00:41:01.021 --> 00:41:01.430
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

994
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:02.580
<v Speaker 1>my own show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

995
00:41:02.581 --> 00:41:05.010
<v Speaker 1>sure you are buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was old MR member the show?</v>

996
00:41:05.011 --> 00:41:07.650
<v Speaker 1>What was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mork and mindy organ to old people in</v>

997
00:41:07.651 --> 00:41:10.470
<v Speaker 1>this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly he does mork and mindy,</v>

998
00:41:10.471 --> 00:41:12.090
<v Speaker 1>but he also makes it the number one</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

999
00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have a beautiful family.</v>

1000
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he says,</v>

1001
00:41:15.421 --> 00:41:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to make more money than I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend.</v>

1002
00:41:16.771 --> 00:41:17.610
<v Speaker 1>He does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he says,</v>

1003
00:41:17.611 --> 00:41:18.810
<v Speaker 1>I want to make movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does that.</v>

1004
00:41:18.811 --> 00:41:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to win an academy award for not</v>

1005
00:41:21.601 --> 00:41:26.601
<v Speaker 1>being funny is number one skill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did it and then he hung himself</v>

1006
00:41:27.031 --> 00:41:30.690
<v Speaker 1>in his own home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving his wife and children to find</v>

1007
00:41:30.691 --> 00:41:31.650
<v Speaker 1>his lifeless body.</v>

1008
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Highly explained that I thought the</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

1009
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:41.180
<v Speaker 1>He made everybody happy but home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then his wife said he had lewy bodies</v>

1010
00:41:41.181 --> 00:41:42.830
<v Speaker 1>and upsets in his brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all true,</v>

1011
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:45.320
<v Speaker 1>but he used drugs and alcohol his entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1012
00:41:45.321 --> 00:41:49.040
<v Speaker 1>He suffered his entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made everybody happy but himself and so</v>

1013
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.030
<v Speaker 1>I love the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1014
00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my birthdays,</v>

1015
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I was at Ted and he did this talk was</v>
<v Speaker 1>very popular and he came to my birthday</v>

1016
00:41:56.481 --> 00:41:57.950
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of guys took me out to dinner</v>

1017
00:41:57.951 --> 00:42:00.350
<v Speaker 1>that night and jumped on top of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>table and saying,</v>

1018
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:03.530
<v Speaker 1>happy birthday as a Russian woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as a Chinese man,</v>

1019
00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.060
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never lost a suicide knock on wood</v>

1020
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:09.950
<v Speaker 1>out of thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've made films and followed up and I</v>

1021
00:42:09.951 --> 00:42:12.550
<v Speaker 1>had no idea that's where he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I looked at him and I'm like that.</v>

1022
00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:15.830
<v Speaker 1>I say he's a warning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As much as we all loved him,</v>

1023
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:18.890
<v Speaker 1>even more so because we left him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know none of you are going to kill</v>

1024
00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:20.210
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not worried about that.</v>

1025
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people live a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really live,</v>

1026
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they let,</v>

1027
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.560
<v Speaker 1>they let their stress and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration,</v>

1028
00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:29.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say achievers don't get</v>

1029
00:42:29.511 --> 00:42:30.980
<v Speaker 1>fearful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all achievers and they don't get</v>

1030
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Speaker 1>fearful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just get stressed.</v>

1031
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Stress is the achiever word for fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when I say to you,</v>

1032
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.460
<v Speaker 1>what are you stressing about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I gotta do this,</v>

1033
00:42:37.461 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I gotta make this thing happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you know,</v>

1034
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to,</v>

1035
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.701
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what of your own?</v>

1036
00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:41.990
<v Speaker 1>It'll fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it falls apart,</v>

1037
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.070
<v Speaker 1>then it will fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it fails?</v>

1038
00:42:43.071 --> 00:42:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you're a failure?</v>

1039
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:47.630
<v Speaker 1>And now if I follow the trail of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>

1040
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 1>it'll take me to your deepest fear.</v>

1041
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.340
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to have your life work</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the face that fear and push through</v>

1042
00:42:53.341 --> 00:42:54.530
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is courage?</v>

1043
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Courage does not mean you're not afraid</v>
<v Speaker 1>of means you're afraid and you do it</v>

1044
00:42:57.171 --> 00:42:58.850
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're scared shitless,</v>

1045
00:42:58.851 --> 00:43:01.700
<v Speaker 1>but you do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you're going to succeed</v>

1046
00:43:01.701 --> 00:43:03.410
<v Speaker 1>at the highest level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to face those fears.</v>

1047
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Leads right to the next question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1048
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.230
<v Speaker 1>based on your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the top three characteristics</v>

1049
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 1>to have in order to be successful for</v>
<v Speaker 1>these type of people?</v>

1050
00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:16.460
<v Speaker 1>What does success look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it feel like?</v>

1051
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.920
<v Speaker 1>What are the characteristics that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get you there?</v>

1052
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 1>What success looks like and feels like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different for everyone because we</v>

1053
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:25.430
<v Speaker 1>all define success in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I leave that to that.</v>

1054
00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:27.530
<v Speaker 1>But what does it take to succeed that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell you,</v>

1055
00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 1>cause I can be an idiot at this point.</v>

1056
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:30.740
<v Speaker 1>But when you've been with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1057
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.890
<v Speaker 1>50 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4 million in live seminars for days and</v>

1058
00:43:33.891 --> 00:43:36.890
<v Speaker 1>nights and days and nights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that whatever we do,</v>

1059
00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:39.380
<v Speaker 1>it's the result of our patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not us.</v>

1060
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.360
<v Speaker 1>There are certain patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll make you angry.</v>

1061
00:43:41.361 --> 00:43:43.400
<v Speaker 1>They'll make you frustrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll make you pissed off.</v>

1062
00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.390
<v Speaker 1>And there's certain patterns of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and feeling and using your body that'll</v>

1063
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:50.120
<v Speaker 1>make you playful and fun and grateful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and excited and passionate.</v>

1064
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.240
<v Speaker 1>And if you think it's you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've done a pattern so long,</v>

1065
00:43:53.241 --> 00:43:55.400
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to change yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy to change your path.</v>

1066
00:43:55.401 --> 00:43:57.800
<v Speaker 1>What are the patterns come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learned them through our</v>

1067
00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:59.150
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you first born,</v>

1068
00:43:59.151 --> 00:44:00.650
<v Speaker 1>you can do anything in your lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you can,</v>

1069
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scream,</v>

1070
00:44:01.341 --> 00:44:02.330
<v Speaker 1>yell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the bathroom,</v>

1071
00:44:02.331 --> 00:44:04.070
<v Speaker 1>your pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try that when you're 30 see if it works,</v>

1072
00:44:04.071 --> 00:44:04.904
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1073
00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.810
<v Speaker 1>but you learn very quickly as time goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

1074
00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:10.640
<v Speaker 1>your love for nothing as a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1075
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Your love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do because your</v>

1076
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:13.371
<v Speaker 1>mother is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1077
00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:15.980
<v Speaker 1>got oxytocin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's drug natural drug in her body.</v>

1078
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Men Get it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let me get 10 times as much.</v>

1079
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.840
<v Speaker 1>That's why a healthy woman cannot leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>her child.</v>

1080
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:23.270
<v Speaker 1>A healthy man can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a woman can.</v>

1081
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I have cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biochemically healthy.</v>

1082
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:27.040
<v Speaker 1>And so you look at this and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.270
<v Speaker 1>what are the three things needed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you what they are the number</v>

1084
00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:31.280
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love intelligence,</v>

1085
00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 1>live wickedly intelligent people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to hire as many of them as</v>

1086
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:35.040
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from them.</v>

1087
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.890
<v Speaker 1>But what's more valuable than</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is hunger.</v>

1088
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at,</v>

1089
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.360
<v Speaker 1>what's the calming down in between</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson,</v>

1090
00:44:42.361 --> 00:44:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Mark Benioff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give me your list of whoever it is.</v>

1091
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee if you dig underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hunger has never gone away.</v>

1092
00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Some people get hungry cause they got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal to achieve something or get in a</v>

1093
00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:55.470
<v Speaker 1>swimsuit by a certain date or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1094
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:57.780
<v Speaker 1>But that's when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the identity change,</v>

1095
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are people that are like myself.</v>

1096
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry today at 57 more than I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 26 you know,</v>

1097
00:45:04.411 --> 00:45:05.160
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1098
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling me out and when I say</v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

1099
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry to contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn,</v>

1100
00:45:08.641 --> 00:45:10.380
<v Speaker 1>to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a difference.</v>

1101
00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll never settled west when I can be or</v>
<v Speaker 1>do or share or give a create and</v>

1102
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:17.410
<v Speaker 1>everyone I know that's successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the driving force because without</v>

1103
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:19.260
<v Speaker 1>hunger you can get the skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With that hunger,</v>

1104
00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:21.570
<v Speaker 1>you can figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that there are a lot of very smart</v>

1105
00:45:21.571 --> 00:45:24.660
<v Speaker 1>people who can't fight their way out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a paper bag and a pragmatic way.</v>

1106
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.531
<v Speaker 1>And they got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1107
00:45:25.531 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great transcripts and shit like that.</v>

1108
00:45:27.721 --> 00:45:30.300
<v Speaker 1>I went to Harvard one time and I spoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>and right before I spoke,</v>

1109
00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:34.820
<v Speaker 1>they had voted at Harvard business</v>
<v Speaker 1>school to not release anyone's</v>

1110
00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:39.180
<v Speaker 1>transcripts to the recruiters of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses coming in to block it.</v>

1111
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And the argument was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your education is more than just your</v>

1112
00:45:43.411 --> 00:45:45.720
<v Speaker 1>grades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went to Buzzer.</v>

1113
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I got up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1114
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Tony,</v>

1115
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.770
<v Speaker 1>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that I expect to be,</v>

1116
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand people.</v>

1117
00:45:50.761 --> 00:45:51.720
<v Speaker 1>There are a couple thousand people</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1118
00:45:51.721 --> 00:45:52.231
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1119
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:53.190
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Gates is here.</v>

1120
00:45:53.191 --> 00:45:54.840
<v Speaker 1>We have 300 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be much smaller.</v>

1121
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.480
<v Speaker 1>But we ended up with about 1200 people</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing room only.</v>

1122
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And they gave me 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I went three hours.</v>

1123
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one laughed.</v>

1124
00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:03.810
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the first things I did,</v>

1125
00:46:03.811 --> 00:46:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this bullshit?</v>

1126
00:46:05.551 --> 00:46:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading this in the paper that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1127
00:46:08.461 --> 00:46:09.750
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be disrespectful,</v>

1128
00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:11.610
<v Speaker 1>but you been disrespectful to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1129
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:13.021
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1130
00:46:13.021 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 1>if you're not willing to show your</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcripts,</v>

1131
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I think I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your career,</v>

1132
00:46:17.371 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 1>who you are as more than just your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your degree here.</v>

1133
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:23.660
<v Speaker 1>But you chose Harvard for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are people here that have</v>

1134
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:25.640
<v Speaker 1>worked around the clock and gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1135
00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:30.390
<v Speaker 1>4.0 and you got yourself a 2.6 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to block them cause there's</v>

1136
00:46:30.391 --> 00:46:32.790
<v Speaker 1>more of you than the 4.0 it's not gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>work that way.</v>

1137
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:34.470
<v Speaker 1>When you get in business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you going a business,</v>

1138
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.380
<v Speaker 1>you guys who are doing this right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be judged on one thing.</v>

1139
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Results and your grades are the results</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this context.</v>

1140
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.670
<v Speaker 1>And if you think your grades are not up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and convince me as the interviewer that</v>

1141
00:46:44.671 --> 00:46:46.810
<v Speaker 1>the grades are a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's so much more united.</v>

1142
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.600
<v Speaker 1>If you can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're never gonna make it.</v>

1143
00:46:48.601 --> 00:46:49.434
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

1144
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.330
<v Speaker 1>you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody voted for that.</v>

1145
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Just count on a future that is full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>

1146
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:55.950
<v Speaker 1>And the room was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1147
00:46:55.951 --> 00:46:57.120
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty intense,</v>

1148
00:46:57.121 --> 00:46:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1149
00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was pretty soft personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden people stood up</v>

1150
00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:04.110
<v Speaker 1>and he did a standing ovation and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1151
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:08.010
<v Speaker 1>this is bullshit because this is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens sometimes in a democracy.</v>

1152
00:47:08.011 --> 00:47:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes in a democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lowest level standard is what</v>

1153
00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:13.110
<v Speaker 1>becomes natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing it right now on the</v>

1154
00:47:13.111 --> 00:47:15.750
<v Speaker 1>political side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing people that you know and</v>

1155
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:19.170
<v Speaker 1>Berkeley home of free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people throwing things,</v>

1156
00:47:19.171 --> 00:47:21.030
<v Speaker 1>burning things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying things,</v>

1157
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.060
<v Speaker 1>who are supposed to be liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should be open for open speech and</v>

1158
00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:26.640
<v Speaker 1>then you see conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just as dumb sing things that</v>

1159
00:47:26.641 --> 00:47:28.230
<v Speaker 1>inflaming people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1160
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not one side or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's us as a society.</v>

1161
00:47:30.671 --> 00:47:33.220
<v Speaker 1>We gotta shift that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to go from demonization to</v>

1162
00:47:33.221 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's a fight over guns,</v>

1163
00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.810
<v Speaker 1>very emotional fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem?</v>

1164
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:40.900
<v Speaker 1>We demonize upside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody in this room,</v>

1165
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.410
<v Speaker 1>whether you're pro gun or against Gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you want gun regulation or not,</v>

1166
00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:47.560
<v Speaker 1>there's nobody in this room that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want their children or their friends or</v>

1167
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 1>their family safe and protected.</v>

1168
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:51.730
<v Speaker 1>We just disagreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People disagree on how,</v>

1169
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:53.720
<v Speaker 1>and if we can start with what we agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1170
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.310
<v Speaker 1>we can actually make progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But today there is no progress because</v>

1171
00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.580
<v Speaker 1>we now also augment this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social media and we augment it with</v>

1172
00:48:00.581 --> 00:48:04.390
<v Speaker 1>a regular media and think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The media is not here to inform you.</v>

1173
00:48:04.391 --> 00:48:07.270
<v Speaker 1>They here to startle you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know if we say something</v>

1174
00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:09.670
<v Speaker 1>inflaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to talk about it,</v>

1175
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 1>share it on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they got a multiplied effect.</v>

1176
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:16.060
<v Speaker 1>It's all about advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to really discern yourself.</v>

1177
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand it's the wild</v>

1178
00:48:18.191 --> 00:48:19.540
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only on the Internet,</v>

1179
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:22.510
<v Speaker 1>but on television as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to decide if you're an</v>

1180
00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:25.720
<v Speaker 1>independent thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is really right and maybe be part</v>

1181
00:48:25.721 --> 00:48:29.140
<v Speaker 1>of the solution instead of another</v>
<v Speaker 1>person that attacks the right or the</v>

1182
00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:31.810
<v Speaker 1>left Donald Trump or whoever it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be attacking.</v>

1183
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.790
<v Speaker 1>And there's lots of people that are easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to attack,</v>

1184
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.770
<v Speaker 1>but attacking doesn't change your</v>
<v Speaker 1>approve anything.</v>

1185
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.680
<v Speaker 1>So in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1186
00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:41.560
<v Speaker 1>we gave you 45 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would anybody here mind if we went a</v>

1187
00:48:41.561 --> 00:48:42.394
<v Speaker 1>little longer?</v>

1188
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Would you mind if we went a little loans</v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

1189
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:49.690
<v Speaker 1>So let me five or six more hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or six more hours.</v>

1190
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.770
<v Speaker 1>We'll bring the bar inside as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll do,</v>

1191
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:57.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1192
00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.710
<v Speaker 1>so I want to finish what I said just for</v>
<v Speaker 1>one second.</v>

1193
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Please don't answer this person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

1194
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 1>which was three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got through one hunger,</v>

1195
00:49:04.031 --> 00:49:04.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go fast.</v>

1196
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Hunger is the number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the number two is having a</v>

1197
00:49:08.831 --> 00:49:12.520
<v Speaker 1>mission larger than yourself because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like having a child,</v>

1198
00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.413
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1199
00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:16.210
<v Speaker 1>having a child was a very exciting thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have a child and you go,</v>

1200
00:49:16.211 --> 00:49:18.210
<v Speaker 1>what did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes really,</v>

1201
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:19.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing with the business,</v>

1202
00:49:19.841 --> 00:49:20.674
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1203
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:23.440
<v Speaker 1>you've got to really be able to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you're doing it for,</v>

1204
00:49:23.441 --> 00:49:24.780
<v Speaker 1>that's more than you can in the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1205
00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:26.440
<v Speaker 1>The business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really make you any money and</v>

1206
00:49:26.441 --> 00:49:27.220
<v Speaker 1>you work your tail off.</v>

1207
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.170
<v Speaker 1>So you need pride of ownership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need joy,</v>

1208
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:31.900
<v Speaker 1>you need a mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really believe until you find</v>

1209
00:49:31.901 --> 00:49:34.030
<v Speaker 1>something that you care about more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

1210
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.210
<v Speaker 1>you'll never discover what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of because we're all doing more</v>

1211
00:49:37.211 --> 00:49:40.000
<v Speaker 1>for others that we love or respect than</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll ever do for ourselves.</v>

1212
00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the beauty of being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

1213
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Most of them to do more for our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1214
00:49:43.361 --> 00:49:45.850
<v Speaker 1>than other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I think the third thing is you</v>

1215
00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:50.860
<v Speaker 1>got mission in hunger is you really have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become obsessed with strategies</v>

1216
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:54.760
<v Speaker 1>because strategies can save you so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1217
00:49:54.761 --> 00:49:56.020
<v Speaker 1>The wrong strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1218
00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I'll get a stupid metaphor if you said</v>
<v Speaker 1>your number one goal is to see a sunset</v>

1219
00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:03.970
<v Speaker 1>and then you start running east as fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can.</v>

1220
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit how positive you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

1221
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how hard you work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how long you been putting</v>

1222
00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:12.670
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the wrong strategy,</v>

1223
00:50:12.671 --> 00:50:16.660
<v Speaker 1>but the right strategy in business and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life can save you a decade.</v>

1224
00:50:16.661 --> 00:50:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And someone else may have spent again a</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade figuring it out to trial and</v>

1225
00:50:20.051 --> 00:50:23.140
<v Speaker 1>error and then they figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be a learn it in six weeks or</v>

1226
00:50:23.141 --> 00:50:26.890
<v Speaker 1>six months or six days or six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that would be my third.</v>

1227
00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:31.390
<v Speaker 2>So let me ask you a question that may be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little off point but,</v>

1228
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:34.290
<v Speaker 2>but I hope helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people in this room and a lot</v>

1229
00:50:34.291 --> 00:50:38.340
<v Speaker 2>of people in the world want to follow</v>
<v Speaker 2>their passion.</v>

1230
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they've also got to put food on the</v>

1231
00:50:42.211 --> 00:50:45.870
<v Speaker 2>table and pay the rent and pay the the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bills.</v>

1232
00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:51.090
<v Speaker 2>How do you do both at the same time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you build,</v>

1233
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:53.400
<v Speaker 2>follow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have your mission,</v>

1234
00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:58.380
<v Speaker 2>have your passion and do that when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know the world is a tough place,</v>

1235
00:50:58.381 --> 00:51:00.780
<v Speaker 2>hard to make a living or to pay the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bills,</v>

1236
00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.120
<v Speaker 2>places expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>

1237
00:51:03.121 --> 00:51:04.140
<v Speaker 2>How do you thread that needle?</v>

1238
00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on who you're dealing with,</v>

1239
00:51:06.071 --> 00:51:08.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the person is entrepreneurial and</v>

1240
00:51:08.591 --> 00:51:10.510
<v Speaker 1>they asked me this question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell them,</v>

1241
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to take care of your kids.</v>

1242
00:51:12.551 --> 00:51:13.780
<v Speaker 1>You've got to pay the bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1243
00:51:13.781 --> 00:51:15.760
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me when you work.</v>

1244
00:51:15.761 --> 00:51:16.481
<v Speaker 1>And they tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you know,</v>

1245
00:51:16.481 --> 00:51:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I work nine to five or eight to five and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm exhausted.</v>

1246
00:51:19.181 --> 00:51:20.560
<v Speaker 1>And they also said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are you doing with the other</v>

1247
00:51:20.561 --> 00:51:22.600
<v Speaker 1>eight hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean cause that's what I did.</v>

1248
00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I worked as a janitor all my long</v>
<v Speaker 1>millburn everything else.</v>

1249
00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I could compress time there because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was based on results,</v>

1250
00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:29.880
<v Speaker 1>not time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I could do a great job in shorter</v>

1251
00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:30.820
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have that time.</v>

1252
00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.550
<v Speaker 1>But then you know what I started doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

1253
00:51:33.551 --> 00:51:35.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven o'clock at night and two in the</v>

1254
00:51:35.561 --> 00:51:37.990
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much at the time I work.</v>

1255
00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.750
<v Speaker 1>That's when I was developing myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the skills,</v>

1256
00:51:40.751 --> 00:51:41.680
<v Speaker 1>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educating,</v>

1257
00:51:41.681 --> 00:51:44.710
<v Speaker 1>starting the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think people just have to realize</v>

1258
00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:48.640
<v Speaker 1>it's gut wrenching process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an entrepreneurship is not for</v>

1259
00:51:48.641 --> 00:51:49.890
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people fail.</v>

1260
00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Entrepreneurship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority fail,</v>

1261
00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>96% of 10 years.</v>

1262
00:51:53.831 --> 00:51:56.710
<v Speaker 1>But what happens after 10 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All clear sailing after that.</v>

1263
00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Anybody Remember Lehman Brothers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ran a century that gross revenues</v>

1264
00:52:02.471 --> 00:52:05.530
<v Speaker 1>over a century of more than a trillion</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a t dollars.</v>

1265
00:52:05.531 --> 00:52:08.170
<v Speaker 1>That's when went through their bank</v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts over that century and they're</v>

1266
00:52:08.171 --> 00:52:10.840
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think it's right for every,</v>

1267
00:52:10.841 --> 00:52:14.320
<v Speaker 1>but I think you have to really be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your personality the right</v>

1268
00:52:14.321 --> 00:52:16.120
<v Speaker 1>personality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to begin in this area,</v>

1269
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:18.010
<v Speaker 1>and then if you're going to work for</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else,</v>

1270
00:52:18.011 --> 00:52:20.860
<v Speaker 1>you can still be company free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that means you've got to stop being</v>

1271
00:52:20.861 --> 00:52:24.400
<v Speaker 1>a consumer and become an owner of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>under entrepreneurs.</v>

1272
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.870
<v Speaker 1>You want to own businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1273
00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Get out of just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1274
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:31.270
<v Speaker 1>don't just own an iphone on the company</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just apple obviously.</v>

1275
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:34.240
<v Speaker 1>How do you keep your energy up and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm up?</v>

1276
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1277
00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wired for it.</v>

1278
00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:39.550
<v Speaker 1>You know what Miss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my nature to some extent.</v>

1279
00:52:39.551 --> 00:52:41.320
<v Speaker 1>But also the other part is I get to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

1280
00:52:41.321 --> 00:52:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who here has ever been touched by my</v>

1281
00:52:43.391 --> 00:52:44.290
<v Speaker 1>work before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.</v>

1282
00:52:44.291 --> 00:52:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Anybody in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look around the room and then I just,</v>

1283
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.260
<v Speaker 1>how's it hard to be inspired when I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a room?</v>

1284
00:52:49.261 --> 00:52:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Then a third or 40% or 50% have used my</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1285
00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And so people come up to me every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens of people a day.</v>

1286
00:52:54.791 --> 00:52:58.660
<v Speaker 1>If I'm traveling and they told me the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most amazing stories outside my children</v>

1287
00:52:58.661 --> 00:53:00.340
<v Speaker 1>and my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the greatest gift of my</v>

1288
00:53:00.341 --> 00:53:00.520
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1289
00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I never get tired of hearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just makes me want to deliver</v>

1290
00:53:03.221 --> 00:53:03.941
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give more,</v>

1291
00:53:03.941 --> 00:53:05.740
<v Speaker 1>have more impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the last word.</v>

1292
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Tell them what you want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1293
00:53:08.261 --> 00:53:10.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're entrepreneurs out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I'd say to you.</v>

1294
00:53:10.811 --> 00:53:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so damn hard on yourself.</v>

1295
00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds counter to being an</v>
<v Speaker 1>achiever,</v>

1296
00:53:16.061 --> 00:53:19.810
<v Speaker 1>but when you're beating yourself up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sucking out the energy and need</v>

1297
00:53:19.811 --> 00:53:22.690
<v Speaker 1>to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like I always tell people,</v>

1298
00:53:22.691 --> 00:53:24.820
<v Speaker 1>there's so much energy and I've built</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

1299
00:53:24.821 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of things to build my energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be incredibly strong and have really</v>

1300
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 1>strong endurance because to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy is life.</v>

1301
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.740
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have strong energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do anything.</v>

1302
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.820
<v Speaker 1>But even after we look at that energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it only goes so many places.</v>

1303
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:40.140
<v Speaker 1>So if your energy's being caught up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take energy and a business and</v>

1304
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:43.170
<v Speaker 1>you pour it into external marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going out and reaching people and adding</v>

1305
00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:45.240
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business is going to grow.</v>

1306
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.570
<v Speaker 1>But if their inner conflicts in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>business between people,</v>

1307
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:52.170
<v Speaker 1>then the energy's being sucked in here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and less energy is going out there.</v>

1308
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:54.810
<v Speaker 1>The business is going to have problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also true of you.</v>

1309
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:59.820
<v Speaker 1>If you allow your disappointments to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create these inner conflicts and fears</v>

1310
00:53:59.821 --> 00:54:03.600
<v Speaker 1>and you let them run wild within you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to suck the energy out.</v>

1311
00:54:03.601 --> 00:54:05.700
<v Speaker 1>You need to go to the next level in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

1312
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.440
<v Speaker 1>You have to discipline your</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment.</v>

1313
00:54:07.441 --> 00:54:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know mine is the 92nd rule.</v>

1314
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:12.450
<v Speaker 1>So watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try something real fast.</v>

1315
00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Look around this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you a task.</v>

1316
00:54:14.131 --> 00:54:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Look around this room and see</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1317
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:16.740
<v Speaker 1>It's Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to test you in a moment.</v>

1318
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Look behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look around you.</v>

1319
00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Look clothing like the people at</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's Brown,</v>

1320
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:20.611
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>

1321
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown.</v>

1322
00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Record recorded in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close your eyes.</v>

1323
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Now with your eyes closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me everything you saw just now.</v>

1324
00:54:27.511 --> 00:54:31.590
<v Speaker 1>That was red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see more brown than red,</v>

1325
00:54:31.591 --> 00:54:34.320
<v Speaker 1>say I open your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look for red.</v>

1326
00:54:34.321 --> 00:54:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Now really look for red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look for it.</v>

1327
00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Anywhere you can find a look around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

1328
00:54:37.111 --> 00:54:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Look beside you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at front back.</v>

1329
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.860
<v Speaker 1>How many found more red this time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hand.</v>

1330
00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:41.810
<v Speaker 1>If you did say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1331
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:46.980
<v Speaker 1>why did you find more red this time that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you told me to seek and Ye shall find,</v>

1332
00:54:46.981 --> 00:54:49.560
<v Speaker 1>but here's what's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seek and you shall find.</v>

1333
00:54:49.561 --> 00:54:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's not there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll prove it to you.</v>

1334
00:54:52.051 --> 00:54:54.720
<v Speaker 1>How many saw beige shit called it brown</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to feel successful?</v>

1335
00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:01.500
<v Speaker 1>How many saw burgundy and called it red?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just download pieces,</v>

1336
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:04.830
<v Speaker 1>so if you think you're a jerk or someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else's,</v>

1337
00:55:04.831 --> 00:55:06.090
<v Speaker 1>a jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to cover it.</v>

1338
00:55:06.091 --> 00:55:08.070
<v Speaker 1>You're going to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find the jerkiness and</v>

1339
00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.390
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find the jerk in you.</v>

1340
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.810
<v Speaker 1>It's really important that you manage</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mental,</v>

1341
00:55:12.811 --> 00:55:14.820
<v Speaker 1>emotional state because you are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

1342
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.910
<v Speaker 1>If you are the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your responsibility,</v>

1343
00:55:17.911 --> 00:55:19.200
<v Speaker 1>your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your opportunity,</v>

1344
00:55:19.201 --> 00:55:23.460
<v Speaker 1>your privilege is to be able to truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead and you cannot lead.</v>

1345
00:55:23.461 --> 00:55:26.790
<v Speaker 1>If you're living in fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot lead in a place of constant</v>

1346
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:28.680
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have uncertainty at times,</v>

1347
00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:32.550
<v Speaker 1>but if you watch an athlete go out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot a free throw or kick her in the</v>

1348
00:55:32.551 --> 00:55:35.100
<v Speaker 1>NFL to go kick the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many were seen that person?</v>

1349
00:55:35.101 --> 00:55:36.510
<v Speaker 1>They're about to kick it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're about to shoot.</v>

1350
00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.550
<v Speaker 1>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to miss it and you know</v>

1351
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:39.180
<v Speaker 1>they're going to miss it.</v>

1352
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Who's experienced this before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you know?</v>

1353
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:44.610
<v Speaker 1>You could see in their body that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing the core ingredient,</v>

1354
00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:48.180
<v Speaker 1>absolute certainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the great skills in the</v>

1355
00:55:48.181 --> 00:55:49.560
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you lose that certainty,</v>

1356
00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.630
<v Speaker 1>the athlete goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's usually when I get the call.</v>

1357
00:55:51.631 --> 00:55:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I got to rewire them and get them back</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they can execute at that level.</v>

1358
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:58.200
<v Speaker 1>So be kind to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Corny as that sounds,</v>

1359
00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:01.380
<v Speaker 1>not to be kind to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's more energy available to</v>

1360
00:56:01.381 --> 00:56:04.590
<v Speaker 1>solve the problems and to build the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and the meet your mission</v>

1361
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.540
<v Speaker 1>because the time you're beating yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

1362
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to prove yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really care.</v>

1363
00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:11.280
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile what you're doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking the energy out of your growth.</v>

1364
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I had somebody who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who embezzle some money when I was a</v>

1365
00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:15.990
<v Speaker 1>tiny company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I want to tell me this $3 million</v>

1366
00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:20.340
<v Speaker 1>and the guy in a quarter million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was seven and $58,000 in debt and</v>

1367
00:56:20.341 --> 00:56:21.420
<v Speaker 1>thought I was in profit.</v>

1368
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.550
<v Speaker 1>And in those days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1369
00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:28.240
<v Speaker 1>every told me I have to go bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I was just like so angry.</v>

1370
00:56:28.241 --> 00:56:30.880
<v Speaker 1>There's so much anger because my</v>
<v Speaker 1>business was like my child,</v>

1371
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:32.710
<v Speaker 1>this guy tried to kill my child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1372
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:35.950
<v Speaker 1>so I was chasing him in Mexico so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could beat the hell out of him,</v>

1373
00:56:35.951 --> 00:56:38.280
<v Speaker 1>put him in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1374
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.880
<v Speaker 1>and then I realized in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>

1375
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:42.820
<v Speaker 1>I got to let go of this because while</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm busy being angry and pissed off,</v>

1376
00:56:42.821 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 1>the business is gonna go under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm chasing birds.</v>

1377
00:56:45.341 --> 00:56:46.510
<v Speaker 1>When we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it gets to the bird,</v>

1378
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:50.920
<v Speaker 1>I got to focus on how to have the value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so take your energy.</v>

1379
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.510
<v Speaker 1>That's all you have in this life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>invested in the things you love and</v>

1380
00:56:55.511 --> 00:56:59.020
<v Speaker 1>those you love and the mission of Your</v>
<v Speaker 1>Business and in your clients.</v>

1381
00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:03.280
<v Speaker 1>If you fall in love with what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you do with and who you do it for,</v>

1382
00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:06.310
<v Speaker 1>there'll be no limit to your impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you gotta be willing to do it for</v>

1383
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:09.490
<v Speaker 1>decades because it's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll hit the lucky thing and</v>

1384
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:11.860
<v Speaker 1>don't happen in 12 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if you don't,</v>

1385
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.840
<v Speaker 1>even if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1386
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a friend who's one of my</v>

1387
00:57:15.581 --> 00:57:19.670
<v Speaker 1>partners in the La Aafc and so forth in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chat and started youtube for example,</v>

1388
00:57:19.671 --> 00:57:22.630
<v Speaker 1>and one point $6 billion in what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 months,</v>

1389
00:57:22.631 --> 00:57:23.890
<v Speaker 1>24 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that type of thing,</v>

1390
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:27.730
<v Speaker 1>if not always the best thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because ultimately in life,</v>

1391
00:57:27.731 --> 00:57:30.820
<v Speaker 1>whenever you meet people at succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost always we talk about the toughest</v>

1392
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 1>times and laugh and remember because in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to have the foreground,</v>

1393
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you need a background and to appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreground,</v>

1394
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you need the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I found that the most difficult times</v>

1395
00:57:39.941 --> 00:57:43.600
<v Speaker 1>have been the best times because they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>made me appreciate what my life is like</v>

1396
00:57:43.601 --> 00:57:45.490
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll be able to take care of</v>

1397
00:57:45.491 --> 00:57:46.600
<v Speaker 1>yourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope today,</v>

1398
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 1>this whole day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the speakers and hopefully a little</v>

1399
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:49.720
<v Speaker 1>of our conversation has been helpful</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1400
00:57:49.721 --> 00:57:51.070
<v Speaker 1>And I thank you for letting me address</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1401
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much.</v>
