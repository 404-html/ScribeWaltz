00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.461
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2
00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>when most people think of success or</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure,</v>

3
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>they think of these big giant things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but failure is not an overnight</v>

4
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>experience and neither is success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Failure was the result of failure to</v>

5
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>make the calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Failure to follow through.</v>

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Failure to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Failure to give 100% that creates</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate failure in life.</v>

8
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 1>The feelings we want to avoid it almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>all costs and yet successes also one</v>

9
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's successfully making the call and</v>

10
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>successfully getting herself up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>following through it successfully.</v>

11
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Making sure you make that unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contact it successfully breaking through</v>

12
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>the limits that used to stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the culmination of all those little</v>

13
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>successes over a lifetime that</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually creates a life that we have</v>

14
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>total pride and joy knowing is our own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm here to tell you that anything</v>

15
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:56.460
<v Speaker 1>you focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a consistent basis,</v>

16
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>you put 100% of yourself into and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can try and prove daily on you will</v>

17
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:02.340
<v Speaker 1>improve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will get better.</v>

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>The problem is most of us in life do not</v>
<v Speaker 1>control the power of our mental focus.</v>

19
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of us focused on things like,</v>

20
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

21
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>how come my life isn't working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come this always happens to me?</v>

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>And if you focus on that enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you'll experience in</v>

23
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever we focus on consistently,</v>

24
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>we tend to manifest in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you already believe that my</v>

25
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>hallucination is you already do or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have picked up a tape program</v>

26
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key is getting ourselves to live by</v>

27
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>these factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>most people in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major and minor things that is,</v>

29
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>they're focused on how to make a living</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of how to design their life.</v>

30
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>You may be wondering what drove me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to really study success in this</v>

31
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>level of depth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

32
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

33
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>how did you become so successful?</v>

34
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 1>While I'm complimented by the statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my response usually is the same</v>

35
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>thing that drives all of us to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of two experiences,</v>

36
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>either inspiration or desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

37
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>it was more desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in an environment I did not</v>

38
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>like and it started back as far as high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

39
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>For me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember looking around and being</v>

40
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

41
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're dissatisfied with some area of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life right now,</v>

42
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>instead of being frustrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get excited,</v>

43
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>cause I got to tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until you get dissatisfied,</v>

44
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>you won't do anything to really make</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life at another level.</v>

45
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Dissatisfaction is a gem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're totally satisfied,</v>

46
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get comfortable and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life begins to deteriorate.</v>

47
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>But I found myself dissatisfied with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

48
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like what I saw growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw my father working extremely hard</v>

49
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>as a salesman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 or 50 hours a week.</v>

50
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>And yet most of the time we were broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't understand why.</v>

51
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I remember what that did to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally.</v>

52
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.050
<v Speaker 1>And that drove a lot enough pain inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me that I thought to myself at that</v>

53
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ever have my family have</v>

54
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>to go through this and I don't wanna</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go through it myself ever again.</v>

55
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I thought someday I'm going to master</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial success so I can only help</v>

56
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people around me,</v>

57
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>and that was a driving force for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>success in that area.</v>

58
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I remember going to high school and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not a real popular kid,</v>

59
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>but I really love people and I being</v>
<v Speaker 1>around them and I wanted everybody to</v>

60
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>like me and a lot of people did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't the most popular kid in</v>

61
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

62
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I thought some day I'm going to meet the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most popular kid in school and I'm going</v>

63
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>to find out what makes them so popular.</v>

64
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>He's probably one of the nicest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most warm and genuine people you could</v>

65
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>ever meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the day I met this kid,</v>

66
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>he treated me like I was dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how dare I enter his space?</v>

67
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could somebody who's this rude be</v>

68
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>this successful and having people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and it made me want to study what</v>

69
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>makes people like other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember looking around at people in</v>

70
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people been married five,</v>

71
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>10 15 years who are just hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

72
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>They still have that passion that drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>for each other.</v>

73
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>They really loved each other 100% it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were newlyweds.</v>

74
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I remember one day going to my mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>

75
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>how come this is my fourth father?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just curious,</v>

76
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>and she told me an explanation that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't quite understand at the time,</v>

77
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it motivated me to want to make</v>

78
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>relationships work.</v>

79
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>So out of all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened for me in my mind is I</v>

80
00:03:58.601 --> 00:03:59.434
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

81
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the way my life is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make it better.</v>

82
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 1>And so somewhere in my mind I linked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what I should do is study success.</v>

83
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you want anything in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to make it a study.</v>

84
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to study it,</v>

85
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>not leave it to chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be happy,</v>

86
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>you've got to study happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be wealthy,</v>

87
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>you've got to study wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be healthy,</v>

88
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>you've got to study health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just hope that things will</v>

89
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>turn out okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see what hoping does for most</v>

90
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people don't have what they want</v>

91
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>and they just keep hoping it will</v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

92
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line for me is I went out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>started studying success like a madman.</v>

93
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I believe that if you will immerse</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and focus on anything,</v>

94
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get good at it and so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to get good at understanding how</v>

95
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:42.040
<v Speaker 1>to make my life work and I went out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>read almost 700 books in the area of</v>

96
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 1>human development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything from your basic positive</v>

97
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>thinking to your more esoteric forms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

98
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>When I find I was so sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is this,</v>

99
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Speaker 1>as they read all this material and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>listened to tapes constantly in my car,</v>

100
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>anytime I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to dump some good stuff into my</v>

101
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to seminar after seminar after</v>

102
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 1>seminar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them were lousy,</v>

103
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>but my attitude was half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to a seminar and all I get is one</v>

104
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth my attending or if I go to a</v>

105
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it does is tell me what I already</v>

106
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hear it another time and now maybe</v>

107
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>by hearing and again I actually now use</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

108
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>What a concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe I can make my life work.</v>

109
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>And so I went for that strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That repetition is the mother of skill</v>

110
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 1>and I heard enough and I read enough and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched enough and I listened to</v>

111
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>enough and I poured so much good stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that you can guess.</v>

112
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Eventually good stuff started coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>back out.</v>

113
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a short period of time,</v>

114
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I became totally successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we all have our own definition of</v>

115
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can guess what mine was back</v>

116
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.990
<v Speaker 1>then growing up pretty poor financially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't even know the answer was money.</v>

117
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.531
<v Speaker 1>I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

118
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 1>if you make enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll solve all of life's problems.</v>

119
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>

120
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>But if you make enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least you can arrive at your problems</v>

121
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 1>in style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You drive up in your limousine to handle</v>

122
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>your problem.</v>

123
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole nother world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

124
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 1>My point is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had really made it.</v>

125
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I thought by the time I was 19 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

126
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I went out and just use massive action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read all these books,</v>

127
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>I listen to all this material and I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and just apply everything I could</v>

128
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>and a short period of time I had this</v>
<v Speaker 1>big company.</v>

129
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 1>I was written up in newspapers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines is this young entrepreneur.</v>

130
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>They called me wonderboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Ego was exploding and I had what I</v>

131
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>thought success was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that time of my life,</v>

132
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was making about $10,000 a month in</v>

133
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for a 19 year old kid for anyone</v>

134
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>seems like a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a lot of success,</v>

135
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 1>but something interesting happened and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interesting thing that happened was</v>

136
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I'd never had that level of success</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

137
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I had never had that many people liking</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and acknowledging me.</v>

138
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 1>I'd never had that much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never had that kind of experience.</v>

139
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 1>It was beyond my comfort zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

140
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking you about consciously</v>
<v Speaker 1>now see consciously I thought I wanted</v>

141
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 1>more and better and all these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things,</v>

142
00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 1>but subconsciously I believe that most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us have a subconscious idea of what</v>

143
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:04.430
<v Speaker 1>we think we deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

144
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:07.220
<v Speaker 1>imagine it as if it's a thermostat</v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to your brain.</v>

145
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 1>If we have a thermostat in this room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we set it at 68 degrees and it's not hot</v>

146
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 1>enough in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things aren't moving,</v>

147
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not warm enough and the temperature</v>
<v Speaker 1>drops down to 62 degrees,</v>

148
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The heaters kick on.</v>

149
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.550
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety.</v>

150
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:23.361
<v Speaker 1>Your brain says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

151
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:24.410
<v Speaker 1>we got to make it better than this.</v>

152
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 1>This isn't good enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sure enough,</v>

153
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you get this push,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this drive to change things and that's</v>

154
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>what happens in life when it's not good</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

155
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>When your life does not represent right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now what you think it should be like.</v>

156
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting though that most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't realize is it happens on</v>

157
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>the other side too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I mean?</v>

158
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you set it at 68 degrees and all of a</v>

159
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 1>sudden things start going really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

160
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 1>it starts heating up in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We start cranking.</v>

161
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.220
<v Speaker 1>If it gets up around 72 73 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens in this room?</v>

162
00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.880
<v Speaker 1>The air conditioners kick on and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to sabotage your own success and</v>

163
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>you drop right back down to where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>subconsciously think you deserve to be</v>

164
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 1>in your relationships and your economics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your level of acknowledgement.</v>

165
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Does this make sense to you?</v>

166
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense intellectually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does make sense when you start</v>

167
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>studying how human beings behave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I did.</v>

168
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 1>I began to sabotage my own success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How I started not short for key</v>

169
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started treat people harshly who</v>

170
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:25.640
<v Speaker 1>didn't deserve to be treated harshly at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

171
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I started eating like I was going out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

172
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I was never into drugs or alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I use food like it was a drug.</v>

173
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>If it didn't like how I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

174
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I just eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to change how I felt,</v>

175
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 1>but then I looked in the mirror and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting fatter and I felt worse so I</v>

176
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 1>ate some more and it just didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got caught up in this vicious circle,</v>

177
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 1>so much so that within two and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>months I gained 38 pounds.</v>

178
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 1>That is not easy to do.</v>

179
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>You have to eat tons of food and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>move very much to pull that off,</v>

180
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>which I managed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line is this though,</v>

181
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 1>as I began to sabotage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't stop with me.</v>

182
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>It started at affect everyone around me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fired almost everyone in my company.</v>

183
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I only had about three employees left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I fired them too,</v>

184
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:07.800
<v Speaker 1>but every time I go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fire,</v>

185
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know and they just keep on working</v>

186
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>thinking sooner or later things would</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out and I become sane.</v>

187
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I went totally broke financially and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved into a little 400 square foot</v>

188
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 1>bachelor apartment in Venice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

189
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>no kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>washing my dishes in the bathtub,</v>

190
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.740
<v Speaker 1>waking up each morning with major goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like what am I going to eat today</v>

191
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 1>and what's going to happen to Luke and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laura on General Hospital,</v>

192
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 1>my favorite program at the time.</v>

193
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 1>So how do I get to be here with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did my life turn around?</v>

194
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is it wasn't just buy more</v>

195
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just buy more technology,</v>

196
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 1>although that made a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What made the big difference for me as a</v>

197
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:49.950
<v Speaker 1>friend came by someone I hadn't seen it</v>
<v Speaker 1>about two years and the reason he came</v>

198
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:52.740
<v Speaker 1>by to visit me and how to track me down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he couldn't call me on the phone</v>

199
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.080
<v Speaker 1>because my phone was disconnected at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this point.</v>

200
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:58.020
<v Speaker 1>My nickname had gone from wonderboy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the newspapers to just,</v>

201
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I changed virtually everything in my</v>

202
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my emotions to my finances,</v>

203
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 1>from my confidence to my physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

204
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.970
<v Speaker 1>How do they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I use what I call the ultimate success</v>
<v Speaker 1>formula.</v>

206
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And here's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has four steps.</v>

207
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>If you want to create the success in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

208
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 1>it always comes back to this.</v>

209
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 1>You can use whatever technology you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reprogram yourself,</v>

210
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 1>but these are the four steps for</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

211
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Step number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to know your outcome in any</v>

212
00:10:27.361 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>situation in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to decide right now what I</v>

213
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:34.620
<v Speaker 1>want out of this situation in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more clear you are on what you want,</v>

214
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.260
<v Speaker 1>the more you empower your brain to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with answers.</v>

215
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.480
<v Speaker 1>There's an old phrase that may have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>overused,</v>

216
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:43.290
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's pretty accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says clarity is power.</v>

217
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.300
<v Speaker 1>You must get focused on what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this tape program we have a goal</v>

218
00:10:48.301 --> 00:10:51.600
<v Speaker 1>setting workshop that's going to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to get precisely clear and what you</v>

219
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Speaker 1>want in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally,</v>

220
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 1>emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially,</v>

221
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:55.740
<v Speaker 1>spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectually,</v>

222
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 1>so that you have something that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving force behind your behavior.</v>

223
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 1>How can you use this first formula to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a difference in your life right</v>

224
00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

225
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 1>How could just getting clear and knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>your outcome help you?</v>

226
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe when you know your outcome,</v>

227
00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:08.940
<v Speaker 1>you've empowered yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

228
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 1>let's say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the middle of an argument and</v>

229
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 1>have you ever gotten caught up in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument where you're so caught up in it</v>

230
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:16.500
<v Speaker 1>that you forgot what you were going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing for,</v>

231
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 1>but you knew you had to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I've been there.</v>

232
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 1>See if in the middle of that argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were to ask the question,</v>

233
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's my outcome in this situation?</v>

234
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 1>You're going to probably find out your</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome is not to argue.</v>

235
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.730
<v Speaker 1>The outcome you want is to resolve</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

236
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.580
<v Speaker 1>When you get focused on what you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>want out of a situation,</v>

237
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:36.510
<v Speaker 1>you empower your brain to use its</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources to produce results right now,</v>

238
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 1>so get into that habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The habit of asking yourself,</v>

239
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.290
<v Speaker 1>what's my outcome and throughout these</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 days I'm going to constantly ask you</v>

240
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 1>how can you use this?</v>

241
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.610
<v Speaker 1>What I just said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's useful about that for your life?</v>

242
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.220
<v Speaker 1>What is your outcome and applying this</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your own life,</v>

243
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.920
<v Speaker 1>it's critical to continually focus on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your target.</v>

244
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're just going to buy it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>visit with a friend on the way over to</v>

245
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:57.220
<v Speaker 1>see a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>

246
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 1>what's my outcome?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the answer is well,</v>

247
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>just to have fun or to make my friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel really appreciated and loved.</v>

248
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know that your outcome,</v>

249
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 1>your chances of having more fun or</v>
<v Speaker 1>making your friend feel love,</v>

250
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 1>go up 1000% versus if you just go over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hang out and wonder why your board</v>

251
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 1>now I'm not saying you have to be so</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal oriented that every minute you're</v>

252
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 1>trying to achieve something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it's useful to let your</v>

253
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:22.580
<v Speaker 1>brain know the direction that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>heading and everyone I know who</v>

254
00:12:22.581 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 1>succeeded had to start with getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear on exactly what they wanted.</v>

255
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Here's step two of the ultimate success</v>
<v Speaker 1>formula.</v>

256
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>step one I did.</v>

257
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I decided what I wanted physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financially,</v>

258
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 1>emotionally in my business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at everything spiritually and</v>

259
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:40.930
<v Speaker 1>once I knew I had the first stage and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal power.</v>

260
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Step two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tapping your power because you've got</v>

261
00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 1>to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is you've got to get yourself to</v>

262
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.460
<v Speaker 1>take action and move towards the</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement of your goals.</v>

263
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what most people tell he is,</v>

264
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

265
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I never had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I try and it doesn't work?</v>

266
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.350
<v Speaker 1>How I can say D is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying,</v>

267
00:12:59.351 --> 00:13:00.910
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got an education,</v>

268
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.910
<v Speaker 1>you're better off than where you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>before because you now know what doesn't</v>

269
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 1>work and you'll probably make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction or two that will help you</v>

270
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:09.640
<v Speaker 1>succeed even more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people in life have no idea what</v>

271
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:10.990
<v Speaker 1>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but worse,</v>

272
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.270
<v Speaker 1>a few people know what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't do anything about it.</v>

273
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.020
<v Speaker 1>They just sit around and hope or say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someday,</v>

274
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:20.050
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do this someday is now someday is</v>

275
00:13:20.051 --> 00:13:22.330
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember hearing a phrase years ago</v>

276
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:25.060
<v Speaker 1>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road to someday leads to a town of</v>

277
00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 1>nowhere and it's a place you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to end up in,</v>

278
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.620
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to get yourself to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

279
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.660
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You decide.</v>

280
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I hear people all the time saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Gosh,</v>

281
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:37.330
<v Speaker 1>how do I change my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my answer is decide to make a</v>

282
00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 1>decision right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not willing to settle for</v>

283
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:42.790
<v Speaker 1>anything less than you can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not willing to live the way</v>

284
00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you're living right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how good it may seem that</v>

285
00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:47.410
<v Speaker 1>you're going to push yourself to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next level.</v>

286
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Demanding more from yourself than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else could possibly expect is</v>

287
00:13:52.211 --> 00:13:55.090
<v Speaker 1>true power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all it takes is deciding.</v>

288
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Remember the word decision and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>original Latin root means to cut off</v>

289
00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:02.950
<v Speaker 1>from when you decide you cut off from</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other possibility.</v>

290
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 1>The biggest trap that keeps people from</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking action is their fear,</v>

291
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.210
<v Speaker 1>their fear of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fair success,</v>

292
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 1>their fear of rejection or fear of pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their fear of the unknown.</v>

293
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.670
<v Speaker 1>The only way to deal with fear is face</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

294
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Look at Iti and take action in spite of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

295
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've probably heard of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the seminars I deal in which we teach</v>

296
00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:25.210
<v Speaker 1>people how to break through their fears</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take action and at the end of the</v>

297
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 1>seminar they get a chance to use what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've learned to overcome a major fear</v>

298
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.780
<v Speaker 1>and literally walked through fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>between 802,000 degrees Fahrenheit and a</v>

299
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:35.020
<v Speaker 1>lot of people think it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

300
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do a thing like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

301
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.850
<v Speaker 1>not to teach people new picnic skills</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if not mind over matter right now.</v>

302
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:44.800
<v Speaker 1>You could walk through fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not encouraging you to make sure you</v>

303
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.360
<v Speaker 1>hear me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could.</v>

304
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.090
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely possible you don't need</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to do it.</v>

305
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 1>You could also be up at 6:00 AM with</v>
<v Speaker 1>total passion for living.</v>

306
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.450
<v Speaker 1>You could also have the person of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams be in your life right now.</v>

307
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 1>You could also be earning what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth.</v>

308
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.460
<v Speaker 1>You could also have more influence on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your children than virtually anyone</v>

309
00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:03.800
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but few people do.</v>

310
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not what we can do in life that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the difference.</v>

311
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 1>It's what we will do and we don't follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>through because we don't know what we</v>

312
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:13.220
<v Speaker 1>want oftentimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we know we're afraid to take</v>

313
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:14.420
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

314
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.180
<v Speaker 1>fear can service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear isn't all bad.</v>

315
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Say it'll make us pay attention as long</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fear,</v>

316
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:23.750
<v Speaker 1>as a counselor and not a jailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that you listen to your fear,</v>

317
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 1>mixed some more distinctions and to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to take action in spite of it.</v>

318
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:29.930
<v Speaker 1>And I gotta tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking through fear is like anything</v>

319
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:30.110
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

320
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like a muscle in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you try and lift to heavyweight boy,</v>

321
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>

322
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:37.550
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you start small and you build</v>

323
00:15:37.551 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 1>every single day for like 30 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

324
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.570
<v Speaker 1>then what's going to happen is every day</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a little stronger and pretty</v>

325
00:15:44.571 --> 00:15:47.720
<v Speaker 1>soon it becomes effortless to do what</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to feel like it was impossible.</v>

326
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:52.190
<v Speaker 1>It's time for you to develop the muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of making decisions quickly and easily</v>

327
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 1>and following through on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the third key element to the</v>

328
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>ultimate success formula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you know what you want and to get</v>

329
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 1>yourself to take action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do your actions always work?</v>

330
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people in life fail much more often</v>

331
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:07.310
<v Speaker 1>they succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

332
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:10.610
<v Speaker 1>the most successful people are the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful people because they failed</v>

333
00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:12.230
<v Speaker 1>more than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

334
00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:13.064
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

335
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Think about it in baseball and baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hall of Famer,</v>

336
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.870
<v Speaker 1>someone who's the best in the world at</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do in the area of baseball,</v>

337
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.380
<v Speaker 1>they fail seven times out of 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd you like to have a life like that?</v>

338
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Bottom line is to get in the hall of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fame.</v>

339
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:32.840
<v Speaker 1>They only succeed about 30% of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They failed more than 70% of the time.</v>

340
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how life is too.</v>

341
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen and doing this taping with you</v>

342
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 1>and talking to you personally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may not sound elegant all the time</v>

343
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:43.190
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I want to do is get across to you,</v>

344
00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I want you to get the message in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>gut.</v>

345
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what matters to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I say something,</v>

346
00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:48.770
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just move on to something else.</v>

347
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 1>And I ask you to try the same thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

348
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Most people in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of their fear of failure,</v>

349
00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:55.790
<v Speaker 1>don't try anything at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's ultimate failure.</v>

350
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.180
<v Speaker 1>You got to get yourself to take action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get yourself to follow</v>

351
00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:03.050
<v Speaker 1>through and you gotta be willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice whether it's working or not.</v>

352
00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:05.750
<v Speaker 1>That's step three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice what you're getting from your</v>

353
00:17:05.751 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

354
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:09.830
<v Speaker 1>you know what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got yourself to take action.</v>

355
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Now notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it working?</v>

356
00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Am I getting closer to my goal or</v>
<v Speaker 1>further away?</v>

357
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Don't kid yourself or just keep taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>action because after all,</v>

358
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:20.750
<v Speaker 1>you work so hard to do it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might as well keep on doing it so you</v>

359
00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:22.460
<v Speaker 1>don't want to get locked in a tunnel</v>
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>

360
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flexibility is power.</v>

361
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 1>What you've got to do though is know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're getting.</v>

362
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean a standard examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had somebody come up and</v>

363
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:35.150
<v Speaker 1>talk to them and they're going on and on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on and you're trying to be very</v>

364
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:36.910
<v Speaker 1>polite and they mistake too.</v>

365
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>You're being polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a way to speed up this formula</v>

366
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.880
<v Speaker 1>and that way is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just knowing what you want</v>

367
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:48.260
<v Speaker 1>and taking random actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use what I call role modeling to</v>

368
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:52.200
<v Speaker 1>accelerate pace of your success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I did is I said,</v>

369
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I want?</v>

370
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm 38 pounds overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to lose this weight.</v>

371
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I want to be 38 pounds lighter and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have more energy.</v>

372
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I want to feel more vibrant to my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell by my energy level that I'm</v>

373
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.740
<v Speaker 1>real low energy person now compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it was then.</v>

374
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided what I wanted and then what I</v>

375
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:08.551
<v Speaker 1>did is I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

376
00:18:08.551 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I've got to take action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what actions should I take?</v>

377
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.920
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried dieting a zillion times and you</v>

378
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:14.754
<v Speaker 1>know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would work.</v>

379
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.730
<v Speaker 1>I would lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gain it right back again and I lose</v>

380
00:18:17.731 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 1>weight and gain it back again.</v>

381
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.560
<v Speaker 1>So what I decided to do is instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>just taking some actions and sooner or</v>

382
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:25.500
<v Speaker 1>later figuring it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to use a role model.</v>

383
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me find someone who's already</v>

384
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:31.680
<v Speaker 1>getting the results that I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Help me find out what that person is</v>

385
00:18:31.681 --> 00:18:36.681
<v Speaker 1>doing and do the same things that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that success leaves clues that</v>

386
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:39.240
<v Speaker 1>if people succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they're doing certain</v>

387
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 1>things over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we do the same kinds of things</v>

388
00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:46.590
<v Speaker 1>and we pumped the same kinds of seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to reap the same kinds of</v>

389
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:50.890
<v Speaker 1>rewards regardless of our age or</v>
<v Speaker 1>background or religion or color or</v>

390
00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.110
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that matters.</v>

391
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 1>What matters is the law works for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone and if you apply it,</v>

392
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.900
<v Speaker 1>it'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you've got to know what to do.</v>

393
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And so this program is the result of me</v>
<v Speaker 1>going out and modeling people that are</v>

394
00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:03.174
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

395
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.480
<v Speaker 1>That is instead of reinventing the wheel</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having you and I kept doing trial</v>

396
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:07.920
<v Speaker 1>and error on everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

397
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:09.060
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me find some of these already in the</v>

398
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:09.960
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out what they do.</v>

399
00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Do the same things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the same results,</v>

400
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.320
<v Speaker 1>speed up time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to remember,</v>

401
00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is not power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowledge is potential power.</v>

402
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you know someone who knows what</v>

403
00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 1>they should do with their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows they should change their life,</v>

404
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.390
<v Speaker 1>knows how they can change their life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still don't do it.</v>

405
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody like that maybe intimately,</v>

406
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 1>like maybe you for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at times than the bottom line is</v>

407
00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:34.350
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to get ourselves to follow</v>

408
00:19:34.351 --> 00:19:36.720
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did I do?</v>

409
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 1>I found somebody who had been overweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>like me,</v>

410
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 1>had become thin and stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then for years I found out what this</v>

411
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 1>person did and I did the same things I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to teach you in this program,</v>

412
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:47.850
<v Speaker 1>what to do to do that.</v>

413
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.830
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just dieting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not enough.</v>

414
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.220
<v Speaker 1>As a result of following through and</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the same actions,</v>

415
00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I lost 30 pounds in 30 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost all 38 pounds in about seven</v>

416
00:19:58.231 --> 00:20:01.530
<v Speaker 1>weeks and I haven't gone back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is I didn't just change</v>

417
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:05.370
<v Speaker 1>my diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned to mentally condition myself</v>

418
00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:08.130
<v Speaker 1>to feel differently about certain foods</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was addicted to.</v>

419
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:11.220
<v Speaker 1>So I no longer had a desire for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things that used to push me over the</v>

420
00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:14.010
<v Speaker 1>edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the same thing in the area of</v>

421
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:17.070
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a man who had the woman of my</v>

422
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:19.380
<v Speaker 1>dreams and I talked to him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

423
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.900
<v Speaker 1>how did you attract this woman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I talked to her and said,</v>

424
00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:23.070
<v Speaker 1>why do you like this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

425
00:20:23.071 --> 00:20:26.370
<v Speaker 1>why are you in a relationship with him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I began to find out certain things</v>

426
00:20:26.371 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 1>he did that made that relationship work.</v>

427
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.560
<v Speaker 1>And I started applying some of the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and I did the same thing</v>

428
00:20:31.561 --> 00:20:34.350
<v Speaker 1>financially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went from a place where I had no</v>

429
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:38.730
<v Speaker 1>confidence in myself emotionally feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed to a place of total strength</v>

430
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 1>and financially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a measurable change to say the</v>

431
00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:43.920
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was broke living in my 400 square foot</v>

432
00:20:43.921 --> 00:20:47.230
<v Speaker 1>bachelor apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened in less than 12 and I</v>

433
00:20:47.231 --> 00:20:50.530
<v Speaker 1>moved to my 1200 square foot apartment</v>
<v Speaker 1>major progress at the time,</v>

434
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:55.270
<v Speaker 1>three times bigger to about four months</v>
<v Speaker 1>later I moved to a 10,000 square foot</v>

435
00:20:55.271 --> 00:20:58.580
<v Speaker 1>castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally a castle built in 1925 with a</v>

436
00:20:58.581 --> 00:21:02.170
<v Speaker 1>big three storey turret overlooking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crashing waves of del Mar,</v>

437
00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:04.750
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't tell you this to impress you.</v>

438
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I tell it to impress upon you how quick</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you can make changes in your life</v>

439
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:12.520
<v Speaker 1>if you learn to master this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer between your ears called your</v>

440
00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:13.354
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

441
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're going to study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to study in neuro sciences,</v>

442
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.890
<v Speaker 1>the sciences of success conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this whole program is about</v>

443
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.350
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to do it a little piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a time so it's simple.</v>

444
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.410
<v Speaker 1>If you will do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culmination of the 30 days,</v>

445
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.860
<v Speaker 1>you will find that you've gone on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental diet that will change your life</v>

446
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If success is really the simple,</v>

447
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.560
<v Speaker 1>if you could go from being where I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

448
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.500
<v Speaker 1>broken every sense of the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally broke,</v>

449
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.500
<v Speaker 1>physically broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially broke,</v>

450
00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:43.600
<v Speaker 1>and financially broke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two Alfie in all those areas,</v>

451
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.630
<v Speaker 1>meeting my dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a millionaire in less than 12</v>

452
00:21:46.631 --> 00:21:48.490
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's really possible.</v>

453
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.210
<v Speaker 1>If it's really as simple as using your</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal power and being flexible in</v>

454
00:21:52.211 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 1>your approach and modeling all</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful people.</v>

455
00:21:54.671 --> 00:21:56.920
<v Speaker 1>If it's really that simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come everybody doesn't do this?</v>

456
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things in life are really</v>

457
00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:02.560
<v Speaker 1>simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people don't apply them because they</v>

458
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:05.740
<v Speaker 1>get caught up in day to day stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

459
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta pay my bills.</v>

460
00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.980
<v Speaker 1>They get caught up in making that living</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of designing the life and they</v>

461
00:22:11.981 --> 00:22:14.980
<v Speaker 1>come to the end of their life and find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out they lived only one 10th of it,</v>

462
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.430
<v Speaker 1>not because they weren't intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply because they didn't get clear</v>

463
00:22:18.431 --> 00:22:20.590
<v Speaker 1>about what they wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get themselves to</v>

464
00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:25.240
<v Speaker 1>consistently take action and develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>that decision making massive action</v>

465
00:22:25.241 --> 00:22:30.190
<v Speaker 1>muscle and their emotional body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't vary their behaviors and now</v>

466
00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:32.920
<v Speaker 1>they're stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a place I think you want to be.</v>

467
00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you wouldn't invest in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>program and you wouldn't be taking the</v>

468
00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:38.380
<v Speaker 1>time to listen now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm asking you to do is break</v>

469
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:39.760
<v Speaker 1>through those fears that stop you.</v>

470
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.770
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest one that comes up again and</v>

471
00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:43.420
<v Speaker 1>again and we've already mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is failure.</v>

472
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I want you to know that failure can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>your best friend.</v>

473
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:47.223
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

474
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.520
<v Speaker 1>The greatest successes in the world are</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who often had so much pain from a</v>

475
00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:54.550
<v Speaker 1>failure that drove them to much greater</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

476
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Did you know those little three m</v>
<v Speaker 1>stickers,</v>

477
00:22:56.651 --> 00:22:59.110
<v Speaker 1>for example?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those ones that you see that you can put</v>

478
00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:00.730
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're called postit notes.</v>

479
00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:02.830
<v Speaker 1>You can write on them and put them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and take it right off</v>

480
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:04.780
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that was a result of a</v>

481
00:23:04.781 --> 00:23:08.860
<v Speaker 1>massive failure by the chemist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was working at the time to create an</v>

482
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:12.610
<v Speaker 1>adhesive that would last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that you could never pry</v>

483
00:23:12.611 --> 00:23:14.470
<v Speaker 1>things apart with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>

484
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:16.300
<v Speaker 1>he came up with the stuff that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work at all,</v>

485
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.100
<v Speaker 1>but he was smart enough to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

486
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:19.090
<v Speaker 1>what can I use this for?</v>

487
00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.740
<v Speaker 1>How can I use this suppose supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure?</v>

488
00:23:20.741 --> 00:23:23.500
<v Speaker 1>And he turned it into a multimillion</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar business.</v>

489
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Lee Iacocca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people would agree is one of the</v>

490
00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:28.060
<v Speaker 1>most successful role models in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

491
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Now I've got a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can we sell successful?</v>

492
00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Because he's a wonder kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

493
00:23:32.561 --> 00:23:33.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say that.</v>

494
00:23:33.521 --> 00:23:36.490
<v Speaker 1>He worked for a company called Ford</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motor Company and he worked his way</v>

495
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:39.010
<v Speaker 1>through the ranks right up to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked his tail off,</v>

496
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.560
<v Speaker 1>was driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What really marked him his ability to</v>

497
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:43.900
<v Speaker 1>get people to take action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his personal power.</v>

498
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.730
<v Speaker 1>He developed skill cause he's willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try almost anything.</v>

499
00:23:46.731 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't accept no for an answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

500
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 1>He had a little run in with a guy by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>name of Ford and he fired him and it</v>

501
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:57.230
<v Speaker 1>burned him pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I've got a question for you.</v>

502
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you think when this company named</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chrysler came by and they look like for</v>

503
00:24:00.681 --> 00:24:02.720
<v Speaker 1>sure there was no way they could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned around.</v>

504
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you think if he hadn't been fired by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ford that he would have taken it?</v>

505
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:06.981
<v Speaker 1>He might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

506
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 1>of course you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way we is.</v>

507
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

508
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.440
<v Speaker 1>According to his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said at the time,</v>

509
00:24:12.441 --> 00:24:13.041
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

510
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:14.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody could turn this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing around.</v>

511
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:16.130
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

512
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I met Mr. Ford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be real happy to hear that that's</v>

513
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:22.400
<v Speaker 1>all it took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so angry from the pain and</v>

514
00:24:22.401 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 1>failure of his past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote failure that he was going</v>

515
00:24:25.251 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 1>to show him that it wasn't his failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Mr. Ford made the mistake.</v>

516
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Another company into mentioned IBM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all started because a guy by the name</v>

517
00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:37.190
<v Speaker 1>of Tom Watson who worked for a competing</v>
<v Speaker 1>company called NCR,</v>

518
00:24:37.191 --> 00:24:39.140
<v Speaker 1>got fired by the CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also,</v>

519
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 1>he got so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

520
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to develop a company that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwarf yours someday.</v>

521
00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome frustration.</v>

522
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I get frustrated,</v>

523
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I've learned to get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a literally condition myself,</v>

524
00:24:51.501 --> 00:24:53.750
<v Speaker 1>so that frustration creates excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

525
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm about to have a breakthrough.</v>

526
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.900
<v Speaker 1>It means my brain is searching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I get confused about something,</v>

527
00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 1>instead of going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never learn this.</v>

528
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 1>My response to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

529
00:25:03.651 --> 00:25:07.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to learn something because my</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is searching for a new answer and</v>

530
00:25:07.101 --> 00:25:08.780
<v Speaker 1>if it keeps searching and it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with one,</v>

531
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.710
<v Speaker 1>I believe the emotions that many of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider negative like frustration and</v>

532
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:17.000
<v Speaker 1>rejection and pain can be our greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends cause they can drive us to</v>

533
00:25:17.001 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

534
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of people when they get</v>

535
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:23.660
<v Speaker 1>successful is they get superstitious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it works so hard for the</v>

536
00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:26.150
<v Speaker 1>success and I now finally have it so all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden they don't change.</v>

537
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:28.430
<v Speaker 1>They don't vary their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kind of like want to stay the way</v>

538
00:25:28.431 --> 00:25:30.980
<v Speaker 1>things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get incredibly conservative and</v>

539
00:25:30.981 --> 00:25:34.430
<v Speaker 1>they miss out on the juice of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay out of the trap.</v>

540
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people succeed,</v>

541
00:25:36.351 --> 00:25:38.480
<v Speaker 1>they tend to party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they fail,</v>

542
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:41.270
<v Speaker 1>they tend to ponder and now the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pondering.</v>

543
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Many times we create our greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>successes in life.</v>

544
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Just remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to fail.</v>

545
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.190
<v Speaker 1>If you try something and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

546
00:25:49.191 --> 00:25:52.310
<v Speaker 1>just try something else and learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>something from what you just did.</v>

547
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:54.170
<v Speaker 1>As long as you learn something you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeeded.</v>

548
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Something else I want to remind you of</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well and that is sometimes people</v>

549
00:25:58.581 --> 00:25:59.121
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Gosh,</v>

550
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna do these exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm going to be better physically</v>

551
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:04.730
<v Speaker 1>and emotionally and psychologically you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't feel more confident but I want to</v>

552
00:26:04.731 --> 00:26:07.280
<v Speaker 1>work on my career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to take my business next level.</v>

553
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I want a business program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they tell you what personal power</v>

554
00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most powerful business</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs because it deals with the</v>

555
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:15.920
<v Speaker 1>source of all your business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just you.</v>

556
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 1>When you're in better shape suddenly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate more effectively.</v>

557
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:20.960
<v Speaker 1>When you're in better shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your creativity flows.</v>

558
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:23.120
<v Speaker 1>When you're in better shape you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better manager of people.</v>

559
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.990
<v Speaker 1>That's why if you saw the infomercial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how I assume you got to this</v>

560
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:29.600
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you saw people like for example</v>

561
00:26:29.601 --> 00:26:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Bill Farley as Farley industries</v>
<v Speaker 1>endorsing this program saying is one of</v>

562
00:26:33.381 --> 00:26:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the best business programs they ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>went through.</v>

563
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because bill became a billionaire</v>

564
00:26:37.671 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 1>before the age of 40 all by using these</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal power type of techniques.</v>

565
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.660
<v Speaker 1>So I want you to know is very business</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented or a Bill Nicholson,</v>

566
00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a turnaround expert from major</v>

567
00:26:48.001 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

568
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 1>in the early eighties he took on a major</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation that was losing $1 million a</v>

569
00:26:53.341 --> 00:26:58.110
<v Speaker 1>day and turn it around so that within</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years it was doing more than $4</v>

570
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 1>billion in revenue in the highest net</v>
<v Speaker 1>returns of the history of the company.</v>

571
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.290
<v Speaker 1>So I want you to know that bees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people endorse it because it works if</v>

572
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:06.660
<v Speaker 1>you're a little bit skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

573
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.640
<v Speaker 1>But understand changing yourself as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first place to change in your career and</v>

574
00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 1>changing your business right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As this tape ends,</v>

575
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I want you to do your first assignment</v>
<v Speaker 1>really simple.</v>

576
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Remember I told you the way to build a</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle so that you're really strong,</v>

577
00:27:21.001 --> 00:27:23.580
<v Speaker 1>it start small and build.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to start with something</v>

578
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:26.310
<v Speaker 1>really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to think of two actions</v>

579
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:29.820
<v Speaker 1>you've been putting off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two things that you should do.</v>

580
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Two things that you need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you keep putting it off.</v>

581
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a phone call or two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's somebody a you've had some</v>

582
00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:38.010
<v Speaker 1>poor communication with and you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean it up,</v>

583
00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:40.650
<v Speaker 1>but you're not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's just going in the house and</v>

584
00:27:40.651 --> 00:27:41.700
<v Speaker 1>cleaning it up right now.</v>

585
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's some kind of report you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

586
00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now I want you to think of</v>

587
00:27:48.031 --> 00:27:51.810
<v Speaker 1>what are two actions you've been putting</v>
<v Speaker 1>off that if you were to take them now,</v>

588
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.190
<v Speaker 1>it would increase the quality of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

589
00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Either simply were just increase the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of your self esteem because you</v>

590
00:27:56.311 --> 00:27:57.870
<v Speaker 1>feel good because you actually fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

591
00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:02.310
<v Speaker 1>or maybe even more powerfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are two decisions or two actions</v>

592
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you could take right now that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately change the quality of your</v>

593
00:28:05.761 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the stop smoking.</v>

594
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's to eliminate certain kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

595
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.410
<v Speaker 1>But if you are going to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now that was going to change your</v>

596
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:15.120
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are those two actions?</v>

597
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.480
<v Speaker 1>And what I want you to do is decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember to decide,</v>

598
00:28:18.481 --> 00:28:21.390
<v Speaker 1>means to cut off and the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility to resolve once and for all.</v>

599
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.870
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tremendous power in that.</v>

600
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Start with something small if you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then build.</v>

601
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.660
<v Speaker 1>But right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down two decisions you've made and</v>

602
00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:33.060
<v Speaker 1>then take action on them immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

603
00:28:33.061 --> 00:28:35.490
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even before I finish talking</v>

604
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:36.360
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop the day,</v>

605
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:38.550
<v Speaker 1>pick up the phone and make that call</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been waiting for.</v>

606
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Do not put it off another minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what it takes.</v>

607
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.360
<v Speaker 1>There's power and momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer that once you set a</v>

608
00:28:45.361 --> 00:28:46.710
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you make a decision,</v>

609
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you should immediately in that moment do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to start making progress</v>

610
00:28:51.061 --> 00:28:53.520
<v Speaker 1>towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way you can't cop out later on or</v>

611
00:28:53.521 --> 00:28:56.940
<v Speaker 1>get caught up or lose your momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So please do it now.</v>

612
00:28:56.941 --> 00:28:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And I know not all things can be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

613
00:28:58.591 --> 00:29:00.300
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's something you have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow morning,</v>

614
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.720
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the decision and then commit to</v>

615
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:05.670
<v Speaker 1>follow through and then check in</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

616
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause this is the first step to grabbing</v>
<v Speaker 1>your personal power.</v>

617
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.040
<v Speaker 1>And remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way to fail.</v>

618
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:11.971
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Gosh,</v>

619
00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:14.520
<v Speaker 1>well if I do this and it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I tried this and it doesn't</v>

620
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:15.600
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

621
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.150
<v Speaker 1>what if I screw up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then screw up big,</v>

622
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.060
<v Speaker 1>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do a big screw up because then you'll</v>

623
00:29:21.061 --> 00:29:22.140
<v Speaker 1>learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

624
00:29:22.141 --> 00:29:25.890
<v Speaker 1>remember success in life as the result</v>
<v Speaker 1>of good judgment,</v>

625
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.790
<v Speaker 1>good judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually the result of experience.</v>

626
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Experience is usually the result of bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment.</v>

627
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.970
<v Speaker 1>So if you've got some bad judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work out.</v>

628
00:29:35.971 --> 00:29:38.310
<v Speaker 1>You'll learn something and I'll make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>more successful in the future.</v>

629
00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be afraid.</v>

630
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you may say,</v>

631
00:29:42.191 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a little thing to do.</v>

632
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it later if it's a little than</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it now.</v>

633
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't put it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

634
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm on your side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

635
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Speaker 1>what I'm trying to be here for you is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good coach.</v>

636
00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how successful you are,</v>

637
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:55.270
<v Speaker 1>we all need a coach.</v>
