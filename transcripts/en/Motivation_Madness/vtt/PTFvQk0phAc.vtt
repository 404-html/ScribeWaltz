00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.570
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not here to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do this,</v>

2
00:00:02.571 --> 00:00:03.620
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that,</v>

3
00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:07.610
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to change the way you think and</v>

4
00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>if I can change the way you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but change what you do,</v>

5
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>can I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to take your brains out of</v>

6
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 1>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squish them up and stuff and back in</v>

7
00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>again and change your world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my goal today.</v>

8
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Let me introduce you to the concept of</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

9
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Ben Franklin was a pretty smart guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to start with a quote by him.</v>

10
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>If you do tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you did today,</v>

11
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you won't get tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you got today?</v>

12
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Want to know what that means?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average American makes between three</v>

13
00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>and five percent more each year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the deal.</v>

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And in today's economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure we're going to make the</v>

15
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:46.840
<v Speaker 1>three to four to five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next year is employed,</v>

16
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>so it takes you 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>double your income in America as an</v>

17
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 1>average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the mediocrity that was stuck in</v>

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>and then give me uncanny ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>double their income in the year.</v>

19
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I got promoted five times in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that beat the system once the</v>

20
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your last name of having a difference</v>

21
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>between them and the ones that don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that they wake up in the morning</v>

22
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>and they think differently.</v>

23
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 2>We're going to look at every aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives.</v>

24
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 2>We go see what we doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

25
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Speaker 2>What was your role?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to analyze this thing and</v>

26
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 2>when we come out of the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we're going to be bigger boned up,</v>

27
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 2>be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you hearing what I'm saying?</v>

28
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.520
<v Speaker 2>And so if you wanted to have it up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it happen,</v>

29
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.860
<v Speaker 2>if we wanted to have it rise and ride,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to happen,</v>

30
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.530
<v Speaker 2>you want to do what I do and that's to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get up at 3:00 in the morning if be</v>

31
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 2>wanted to have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means you don't have to get home at</v>

32
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 2>2:15 and get your butt up in troy six.</v>

33
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.770
<v Speaker 3>I was lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found what I love to do.</v>

34
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.360
<v Speaker 3>The heaviness of being successful was</v>
<v Speaker 3>replaced by the lightness of being a</v>

35
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:15.194
<v Speaker 3>beginner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

36
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 3>less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I convinced that the only thing that</v>

37
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:21.440
<v Speaker 3>kept me going was that I loved what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

38
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 3>You got to find what you love and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is as true for work as it is for your</v>

39
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:29.480
<v Speaker 3>lovers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your work is going to fill in large part</v>

40
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 3>of your life and you only way to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly satisfied is to do what you</v>

41
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:36.190
<v Speaker 3>believe is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only way to do great</v>

42
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't found it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep looking.</v>

43
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Don't settle her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As with all matters of the heart,</v>

44
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.470
<v Speaker 3>you'll know when you find it in like any</v>
<v Speaker 3>great relationship,</v>

45
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 3>it just gets better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the years went along.</v>
