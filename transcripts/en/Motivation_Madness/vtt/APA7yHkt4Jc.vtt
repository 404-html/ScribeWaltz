1
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear what the cow said to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>farmer on a cold winter morning?</v>

2
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for the warm hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

3
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so don't panic on the</v>

4
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.183
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small.</v>

5
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Nice to see all of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have never seen me</v>

6
00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this your first time?</v>

7
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of you.</v>

8
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep thinking for sure.</v>

9
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm more famous than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

10
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the truth.</v>

11
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm delighted to be here and looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward to it for a long time and it's</v>

12
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>nice to be back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I was here not too long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to be invited back.</v>

14
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>It says something when you're invited</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

15
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say everything but says</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's give him one more chance.</v>

17
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if he can get it right this time.</v>

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>But I'm delighted to have all of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

19
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>We're going to spend the day together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel two major responsibilities and</v>

20
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you can guess what those are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one is to make sure you get your</v>

21
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>money's worth right when you shallow out</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cash,</v>

22
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>basically these days you want to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure you get full value for the money</v>

23
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>you spent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know the tab for the seminar was</v>

24
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 1>not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty modest fee to get in most of you,</v>

25
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>your tips for the week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want you to be able to say,</v>

27
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>when you walk out of here today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was worth my money,</v>

28
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>but my biggest responsibility is to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure you get your time's worth.</v>

29
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I say that is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>time is more valuable than money.</v>

30
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might start your notes with that.</v>

31
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Time is more valuable than money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get more money,</v>

32
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately you can't get more</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

33
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>If somebody asked you to spend your</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

34
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>We live in America were wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the money's not the problem,</v>

36
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>but what if somebody asks you to spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day?</v>

37
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to think that over carefully,</v>

38
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 1>and I know you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't waste one of my days and not</v>

39
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>for anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for anything.</v>

40
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Once I understood how valuable they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

41
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't waste any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to make an investment like today of</v>

42
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>your money and your time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

43
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>That today is going to be constantly for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

44
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 1>It's going to cost me one of my days to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be here</v>

45
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and some money of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

46
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't need the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take the money,</v>

47
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need the money,</v>

48
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.040
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do need the time.</v>

49
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.980
<v Speaker 1>So I'm here not to just joke with you on</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

50
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>not to just tell some funny stories and</v>
<v Speaker 1>give a performance and walk away.</v>

51
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to give you some value and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to make it worth your time.</v>

52
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to invest a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to invest today.</v>

53
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's get the most out of it and see</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we can walk away with today.</v>

54
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you that have not seen me before.</v>

55
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Just very briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just tell you my story.</v>

56
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Idaho farm country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southwest corner of Idaho.</v>

57
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father still lives on the old</v>

58
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>homestead where I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll be 89.</v>

59
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>His next birthday still hasn't retired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of.</v>

60
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>My Dad has never been ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's really something.</v>

61
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get him to retire this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

62
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>80 eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling my father,</v>

63
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:23.310
<v Speaker 1>what a good year to retire when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>88.</v>

64
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

65
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>talk to me in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

66
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>I might be ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

67
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I went to high school.</v>

68
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I graduated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to college one year.</v>

69
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Halfway through my second year of</v>
<v Speaker 1>college I decided I was smart enough.</v>

70
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>So I quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my major mistakes.</v>

71
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I should've stayed in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

72
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.050
<v Speaker 1>but I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

73
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm smart enough to get a job.</v>

74
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what life's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay your bills,</v>

76
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>were card and stay out of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep your fingers crossed and hope for</v>

77
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I figured I was at least prepared to</v>

78
00:03:56.501 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I quit college and went to work.</v>

79
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Then a while later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got married,</v>

80
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>got my little family going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm out there doing what I thought</v>

81
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>was the best I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at about age 25,</v>

82
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've purchased a little more than I can</v>

83
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 1>conveniently pay for on time and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>creditors are starting to call saying,</v>

84
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you told us the check was in the mail.</v>

85
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>What's the deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm getting embarrassed by that.</v>

86
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm also embarrassed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big mouth me with all the fancy promises</v>

87
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:32.431
<v Speaker 1>I made to get married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm way behind on those promises and I'm</v>

88
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 1>getting discouraged or wondering what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

89
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I should go back to school,</v>

90
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One Year of college.</v>

91
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Pretty short on an application.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

92
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough to go back to school,</v>

93
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you got your family</v>

94
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time to stay is when you're there.</v>

95
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I discounted that.</v>

96
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.911
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

97
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:54.940
<v Speaker 1>if I had my own business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the way to go.</v>

98
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm short on money too much month at the</v>

99
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>end of the money you've ever been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I was age 25.</v>

100
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>So I had to discount that and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>discouraged wondering where do I go from</v>

101
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the miracle happened for me.</v>

102
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Good fortune came my way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who can explain good fortune?</v>

103
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable things that happened to you</v>

104
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 1>at a particular time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's just unexplainable how</v>

105
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>those things happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my friends says,</v>

106
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:26.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

107
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>things don't just happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things happen.</v>

108
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Just another good note for your notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things don't just happen.</v>

109
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>

110
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

111
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm an amateur on life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess like most of us are trying to</v>

112
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to make it valuable.</v>

113
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.390
<v Speaker 1>But I was ready and my good fortune was</v>
<v Speaker 1>at age 25.</v>

114
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I met a very wealthy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was Mr Shoaff,</v>

115
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Mr Earl show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine had gone to work for</v>

116
00:05:58.521 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>him and he started telling me about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

117
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to meet this man I've gone to</v>

118
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>work for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's wealthy,</v>

119
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>but he's easy to talk to a and he's got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a unique philosophy of life.</v>

120
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And the more he kept talking about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

121
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:12.081
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

122
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I've got to meet this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sure enough,</v>

123
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>shortly after that I had a chance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet this remarkable wealthy man.</v>

124
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>And I was impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was wealthy.</v>

125
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was easy to talk to.</v>

126
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I was so intrigued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within a few minutes,</v>

127
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could be like him,</v>

128
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 1>farm boy from Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be like him.</v>

129
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I'd give anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought if I could just get</v>

130
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>around somebody like him and if he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach me what to do,</v>

131
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I would be willing to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm coachable.</v>

132
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 1>And that was my good fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few months later,</v>

133
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:48.790
<v Speaker 1>this wealthy man that I met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Joe took a liking to me,</v>

134
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.510
<v Speaker 1>hired me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me a job.</v>

135
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I went to work for him and I spent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next five years in his employer.</v>

136
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.690
<v Speaker 1>And then unfortunately he died at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of that period at age 49 his last</v>

137
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 1>five years.</v>

138
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>But the first five years of my new life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to spend with this remarkable man.</v>

139
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>And my dream came true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He coached me and taught me.</v>

140
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>He taught me the books to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He taught me the discipline.</v>

141
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>He taught me the changes to make in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>language and personality and the things</v>

142
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.740
<v Speaker 1>he shared with me during that five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

143
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>literally changed my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned my life around,</v>

144
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.850
<v Speaker 1>change my income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed my bank account.</v>

145
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 1>That changed my future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed everything.</v>

146
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I've never been the same since that</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique experience and I wish he was</v>

147
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 1>still alive today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Show,</v>

148
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if he was alive today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially after this seminar,</v>

149
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Idaho farm boy and mix it to Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fort worth,</v>

<v Speaker 1>standing room only.</v>

151
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he was alive.</v>

152
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I'd be calling him today saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't believe what's happening to</v>

153
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a chance now to share with</v>

154
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:56.690
<v Speaker 1>other people what you shared with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

155
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 1>how I got here 30 plus years ago.</v>

156
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I was living in Beverly Hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California and one day a friend of mine,</v>

157
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>businessmen friend said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>

158

<v Speaker 1>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to have you come and share your</v>

159
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:13.610
<v Speaker 1>story with my service club that I belong</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Rotary Club.</v>

160
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know your story.</v>

161
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Idaho farm boy and makes it to beverly</v>
<v Speaker 1>hills,</v>

162
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>but he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my club members would love to</v>

163
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:21.381
<v Speaker 1>hear your story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

164
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>if I arranged one of our breakfast</v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings,</v>

165
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>would you come and tell your story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just share a few thoughts.</v>

166
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

167
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I agreed to go give this breakfast</v>

168
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.890
<v Speaker 1>talk and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They liked it.</v>

169
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 1>And my telephone rang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got another call.</v>

170
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I've got another call saying we heard a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've given your story and shared some</v>

171
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you come talk to our club?</v>

172
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Tough dark club?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First thing I know I'm starting to</v>

173
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>devote a piece of my business time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving these talks.</v>

174
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>And then one day a businessman who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard my talk,</v>

175
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 1>I think two or three times approached me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

176
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.840
<v Speaker 1>would you come and share that story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some thoughts with my management and</v>

177
00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>sales?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got this little company going and</v>

178
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd come and tell your story to my</v>

179
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.060
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said I'd be happy to pay.</v>

180
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

181
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.780
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't that be something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I agreed to go do it and I got paid.</v>

182
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Little did I know another fortune was</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for me to translate my ideas</v>

183
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 1>into talks and speeches and seminars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I've written some books.</v>

184
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 1>It's on cassette tape now I get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel around the world.</v>

185
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:33.201
<v Speaker 1>Last year I was in Japan is real Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

186
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>

187
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

188
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now Dallas,</v>

189
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:47.181
<v Speaker 1>fort worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idaho farm boy gets to travel around the</v>

190
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:50.090
<v Speaker 1>world and sharing dory and here I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

191
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost too much for me to</v>

192
00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:54.500
<v Speaker 1>comprehend from where I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised in obscurity,</v>

193
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.850
<v Speaker 1>a little small farm community and now to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be here.</v>

194
00:09:58.851 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Today's pretty awesome for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

195
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>that's just a little bit about my story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My story is probably more intriguing for</v>

196
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 1>me than it is for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to hear it again.</v>

197
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:10.680
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I would just bore you with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it anyway.</v>

198
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't ask you to be impressed today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the one that's impressed from where</v>

199
00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I came from to have a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the American dream,</v>

200
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:17.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come true.</v>

201
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Chance to start from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start from obscurity.</v>

202
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Start with pennies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start with nothing and have a chance to</v>

203
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>transform your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change your life,</v>

204
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>set your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see what you can accomplish.</v>

205
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.300
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I got here and I'm just</v>

206
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:37.020
<v Speaker 1>delighted that this day has arrived and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly want to make it valuable for</v>

207
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to work.</v>

208
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I hope you'll find out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this seminar today for your notes.</v>

209
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I hope you'll find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

210
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.090
<v Speaker 1>sincerity</v>
<v Speaker 1>above all else today.</v>

211
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:59.091
<v Speaker 1>I hope you will find me sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best place for people to start to</v>

212
00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:03.910
<v Speaker 1>communicate his sincerity on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're sincere or you wouldn't</v>

213
00:11:03.911 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 1>be here today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

214
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.420
<v Speaker 1>To spend this kind of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to spend this kind of time.</v>

215
00:11:07.421 --> 00:11:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Roll up your sleeves today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to work like I am,</v>

216
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.750
<v Speaker 1>and get this message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be sincere,</v>

217
00:11:13.751 --> 00:11:15.490
<v Speaker 1>so I assume you're sincere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

218
00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I want you to see me sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've got a good note for you to</v>

219
00:11:19.121 --> 00:11:21.550
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sincerity is not a test of truth.</v>

220
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Important note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sincerity is not a test</v>

221
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.723
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

222
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.820
<v Speaker 1>We must not make the mistake of saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must be right.</v>

223
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 1>He's so sincere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a mistake,</v>

224
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.600
<v Speaker 1>and here's why it's possible to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sincerely wrong,</v>

225
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.460
<v Speaker 1>so we don't mistake sincerity for truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

226
00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Sincerity is only a test of sincerity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truth has to yet be tested by truth.</v>

227
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hopefully you will find</v>

228
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 3>me sincere and truthful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next,</v>

229
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 3>a combination of things I hope you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>find here today.</v>

230
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Ideas plus inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>

231
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.250
<v Speaker 3>plus inspiration</v>

232
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.090
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>business ideas,</v>

233
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 3>and social ideas and personal ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all need ideas,</v>

234
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How to have a good day,</v>

235
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to have a good year,</v>

236
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to have your best year ever.</v>

237
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 3>Ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good health ideas,</v>

238
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 3>personal relationship ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to deal with your family ideas,</v>

239
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:30.511
<v Speaker 3>sales management ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>financial freedom for the future ideas.</v>

240
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:36.100
<v Speaker 3>We all need good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So today I hope you gather up by notes</v>

241
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.520
<v Speaker 3>and by what you can remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of ideas.</v>

242
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:43.180
<v Speaker 3>I want to share as many with you as I</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly can and the time constraints we</v>

243
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:47.280
<v Speaker 3>have today is going to go very rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to think a day like this was a</v>

244
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.910
<v Speaker 3>long day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Found out it's pretty short day,</v>

245
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to go as fast as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>share with you as many ideas as I</v>

246
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:56.440
<v Speaker 3>possibly can and here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideas can be life changing.</v>

247
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.760
<v Speaker 3>Ideas can be life changing and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you need is just one more in a</v>

248
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:04.540
<v Speaker 3>series of good ideas.</v>

249
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like dialing the numbers into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lock,</v>

250
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got five or six numbers dialed into</v>

251
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.930
<v Speaker 3>the lock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lock still won't come open,</v>

252
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.360
<v Speaker 3>but you don't need five or six more</v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

253
00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you just need one more and maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 3>seminar like this could do.</v>

254
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.010
<v Speaker 3>A sermon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could do it.</v>

255
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.920
<v Speaker 3>The lyric from a song could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dialogue from a movie,</v>

256
00:13:24.921 --> 00:13:28.160
<v Speaker 3>you could do it conversation with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend might do it.</v>

257
00:13:28.161 --> 00:13:30.920
<v Speaker 3>That one last piece,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need number,</v>

258
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.350
<v Speaker 3>dial it into the lock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

259
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.100
<v Speaker 3>The lock comes open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the door for you to walk through</v>

260
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.040
<v Speaker 3>and maybe this seminar today could</v>
<v Speaker 3>furnish that for you.</v>

261
00:13:40.041 --> 00:13:42.590
<v Speaker 3>One more idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you've come with a lot already.</v>

262
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes we get the impression I used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have that,</v>

263
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.780
<v Speaker 3>but I only had this much going for me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I needed this much,</v>

264
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.110
<v Speaker 3>usually not true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure not true of this audience.</v>

265
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Where do I find you today as well</v>
<v Speaker 3>dressed as you look today.</v>

266
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine as you are sitting here today.</v>

267
00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.440
<v Speaker 3>It isn't that you know you've got this</v>
<v Speaker 3>much going for you and you need this</v>

268
00:14:00.441 --> 00:14:03.350
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume you've got this much</v>

269
00:14:03.351 --> 00:14:07.460
<v Speaker 3>going for you and maybe all you need is</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a few more thoughts,</v>

270
00:14:07.461 --> 00:14:08.970
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

271
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:13.010
<v Speaker 3>to furnish Houston ways and means to</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn your life into the dream you want</v>

272
00:14:13.011 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 3>it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So ideas.</v>

273
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.030
<v Speaker 3>The seminar is going to be loaded with</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

274
00:14:17.031 --> 00:14:19.700
<v Speaker 3>I want you to take good notes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's what else I hope you'll find</v>

275
00:14:19.701 --> 00:14:21.440
<v Speaker 3>here today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is inspiration</v>

276
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.130
<v Speaker 3>and who knows the mystery of</v>
<v Speaker 3>inspiration,</v>

277
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.470
<v Speaker 3>why some people are inspired and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>are not.</v>

278
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.980
<v Speaker 3>You weren't inspired to get here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some were not.</v>

279
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Who knows the mystery of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

280
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.890
<v Speaker 3>How come you made it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rest of them didn't make it.</v>

281
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.130
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what that mystery is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people turned it down,</v>

282
00:14:40.131 --> 00:14:43.220
<v Speaker 3>some people said it costs too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people say it's going to take too</v>

283
00:14:43.221 --> 00:14:46.310
<v Speaker 3>much time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people are too busy,</v>

284
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of different excuses why some are</v>

285
00:14:48.531 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 3>inspired to take advantage of something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that comes to town and pass it up.</v>

286
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 3>We don't know the mystery to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I call it,</v>

287
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 3>mysteries of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I just leave it at that.</v>

288
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.590
<v Speaker 3>Some things I don't try to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take the simple approach now,</v>

289
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people do and some people don't.</v>

290
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:06.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's about as profound as my</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy is.</v>

291
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Some buyers and some don't buy something</v>
<v Speaker 3>go forward and some don't.</v>

292
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.950
<v Speaker 3>Some change and some don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you've been around for awhile,</v>

293
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.150
<v Speaker 3>you can usually work out the numbers</v>
<v Speaker 3>right out of 10,</v>

294
00:15:21.151 --> 00:15:23.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three do $7,</v>

295
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 3>whatever business you're involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty soon you've got this ratio going.</v>

296
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.270
<v Speaker 3>The ones that do the ones that don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

297
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:30.950
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't the ones that don't,</v>

298
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 3>how come they don't?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

299
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 3>I just leave it as a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to try to understand all that.</v>

300
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 3>I just take the simple approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the guy says,</v>

301
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Speaker 3>this happens to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This happened to me.</v>

302
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 3>This goes wrong for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all this stuff goes wrong for me.</v>

303
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Speaker 3>How come all this stuff happens to me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

304
00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:45.554
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beats me.</v>

305
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.050
<v Speaker 3>The Best I've been able to figure it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>is those kinds of things always happen</v>

306
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:51.860
<v Speaker 3>to people like you.</v>

307
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the best I got.</v>

308
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an amateur on this stuff.</v>

309
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 3>What do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just take the simple approach,</v>

310
00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.150
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it is.</v>

311
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.100
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting story says the day the</v>

312
00:16:07.101 --> 00:16:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Christian church was started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm an amateur on the Bible,</v>

313
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.170
<v Speaker 3>but best account I can remember the day</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Christian church was started,</v>

314
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.550
<v Speaker 3>a magnificent sermon was preached,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great presentation,</v>

315
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 3>and if you're a student of all at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have good communication.</v>

316
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.120
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the classic presentations</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all times the sermon.</v>

317
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.710
<v Speaker 3>The first day the Christian church was</v>
<v Speaker 3>started and it said the sermon.</v>

318
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:32.630
<v Speaker 3>This presentation was given to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>multitude,</v>

319
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.620
<v Speaker 3>meaning a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was interesting as the account</v>

320
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.400
<v Speaker 3>gives us the record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says when the sermon was finished,</v>

321
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.700
<v Speaker 3>there was a variety of reaction to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same server.</v>

322
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.070
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that fascinating?</v>

323
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.490
<v Speaker 3>I find it fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It said some that heard this</v>

324
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.580
<v Speaker 3>presentation were perplexed and I read</v>
<v Speaker 3>the presentation sounded pretty</v>

325
00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:55.790
<v Speaker 3>straightforward to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

326
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 3>why would somebody be perplexed with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>

327
00:16:57.831 --> 00:16:59.570
<v Speaker 3>sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straightforward presentation?</v>

328
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Best Answer I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are the perplexed.</v>

329
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 3>What other explanation is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter who's preaching.</v>

330
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.890
<v Speaker 3>It said some that heard this</v>
<v Speaker 3>presentation mocked and laughed,</v>

331
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:15.440
<v Speaker 3>made fun of the presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

332
00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this looks pretty sincere to me.</v>

333
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.630
<v Speaker 3>If you give a sincere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>honest presentation,</v>

334
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 3>why would somebody mock and laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Easy explanation.</v>

335
00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:28.940
<v Speaker 3>They are the mockers and the laughers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else would you expect them to do?</v>

336
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.550
<v Speaker 3>I used to try to straighten all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

337
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:31.741
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

338
00:17:31.741 --> 00:17:33.380
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do that anymore.</v>

339
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.170
<v Speaker 3>I've got peace of mind now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sleep like a baby.</v>

340
00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:37.760
<v Speaker 3>Not try to straighten all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

341
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.340
<v Speaker 3>I used to be so naive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to say,</v>

342
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liars shouldn't lie.</v>

343
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.140
<v Speaker 3>See how naive can you be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they're supposed to lie.</v>

344
00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:47.040
<v Speaker 3>That's why we call them liars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lie.</v>

345
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Why don't straighten this stuff out</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

346
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.000
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it said some that heard this magnificent</v>

347
00:17:57.001 --> 00:17:59.490
<v Speaker 3>presentation didn't know what was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

348
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 3>and they're usually easy to spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're usually saying,</v>

349
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:03.540
<v Speaker 3>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

350
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what's going on,</v>

351
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.450
<v Speaker 3>but interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

352
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.970
<v Speaker 3>A variety of reaction to the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>sincere,</v>

353
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:12.510
<v Speaker 3>honest presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it also says in wrapping it up,</v>

354
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.810
<v Speaker 3>some that heard the presentation</v>
<v Speaker 3>believed,</v>

355
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.390
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's who the speaker was</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for.</v>

356
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.880
<v Speaker 3>The believers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

357
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.910
<v Speaker 3>Now it said the number of believers was</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 3000,</v>

358
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.620
<v Speaker 3>so pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First Day,</v>

359
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.590
<v Speaker 3>3000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had some first days though.</v>

360
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.710
<v Speaker 3>I never had 3000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

361
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 3>3000 were believers and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaker was looking for the believers</v>

362
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:39.300
<v Speaker 3>out of this multitude and that's about</v>
<v Speaker 3>as close as we can come to understanding</v>

363
00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 3>the mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some believe and some mock and some</v>

364
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:46.440
<v Speaker 3>laugh and some are perplexed and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what's going on and you just</v>

365
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 3>have to leave it that way.</v>

366
00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's the way it's going to be.</v>

367
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 3>The way to be brilliant is to find out</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it's going to be and then say,</v>

368
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:54.300
<v Speaker 3>here's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

369
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 3>that's how you'd be coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>

370
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows the mystery,</v>

371
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:02.490
<v Speaker 3>I call it mysteries of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand,</v>

372
00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:05.460
<v Speaker 3>but I don't try to change it anymore on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this particular story.</v>

373
00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:08.310
<v Speaker 3>As far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have classes after the</v>

374
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:10.800
<v Speaker 3>presentation to try to deeper plex the</v>
<v Speaker 3>perplexed.</v>

375
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they left them for plaques.</v>

376
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.810
<v Speaker 3>They left the mockers mocking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They let the laughers laugh.</v>

377
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean they didn't come back and try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>straighten all this out.</v>

378
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.721
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

379
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:22.990
<v Speaker 3>how can you build a church?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

380
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.950
<v Speaker 3>make another presentation and you'll get</v>
<v Speaker 3>some believers and some mockers,</v>

381
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.560
<v Speaker 3>some laughers and some who don't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>

382
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.170
<v Speaker 3>So that's about the best we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

383
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.180
<v Speaker 3>But I'm glad I've got the believers here</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

384
00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:38.160
<v Speaker 3>You believed enough to shell out your</v>
<v Speaker 3>cash and parked with your time and some</v>

385
00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:40.350
<v Speaker 3>of your effort and energy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I appreciate that,</v>

386
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.950
<v Speaker 3>so hopefully you'll find some</v>
<v Speaker 3>inspiration here today.</v>

387
00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.640
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get the most out of today,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a day like this and be thankful for what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you already have.</v>

391
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.490

<v Speaker 3>and if I could just get to Poland and</v>

412
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.910
<v Speaker 3>I did a seminar one weekend up at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ranch up at clear lake,</v>

413
00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.600
<v Speaker 3>got a lodge up there,</v>

<v Speaker 3>weekend.</v>

415
00:21:03.501 --> 00:21:04.610
<v Speaker 3>Friday evening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saturday,</v>

416
00:21:04.611 --> 00:21:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People drove in from around California.</v>

417
00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.290
<v Speaker 3>I got there late Friday afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody had pretty well already gotten</v>

418
00:21:12.291 --> 00:21:13.970
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe the parking lot.</v>

419
00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:20.140
<v Speaker 3>Continentals and Eldorados and Mercedes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and cadillacs and unbelievable Ferrari.</v>

420
00:21:21.621 --> 00:21:23.840
<v Speaker 3>One Rolls Royce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>

421
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.690
<v Speaker 3>I walked in the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like this,</v>

422
00:21:26.691 --> 00:21:29.390
<v Speaker 3>sitting there ready for the weekend</v>
<v Speaker 3>seminar.</v>

423
00:21:29.391 --> 00:21:31.190
<v Speaker 3>My opening remarks were ladies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen,</v>

424
00:21:31.191 --> 00:21:35.210
<v Speaker 3>I think the rest of the world would find</v>
<v Speaker 3>it strange that we have all come here</v>

425
00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.460
<v Speaker 3>this weekend to try to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do better.</v>

426
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:42.800
<v Speaker 3>I think the rest of the world would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand in his Rolls Royce</v>

427
00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.080
<v Speaker 3>and I got to get to the seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out how to get another one of these</v>

428
00:21:45.081 --> 00:21:49.730
<v Speaker 3>rolls royces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>

429
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's be thankful.</v>

430
00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.740
<v Speaker 3>Here's what locks up the doors and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>channels to receive more cynicism that</v>

431
00:21:57.531 --> 00:22:00.470
<v Speaker 3>locks you away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that prevents you from learning more.</v>

432
00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:03.770
<v Speaker 3>Being a cynic about the past and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future of cynic,</v>

433
00:22:03.771 --> 00:22:06.530
<v Speaker 3>about the marketplace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cynical about the people,</v>

434
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.040
<v Speaker 3>cynical about the institution since</v>
<v Speaker 3>cynical about the setup,</v>

435
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.990
<v Speaker 3>cynical about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cynical about your chances.</v>

436
00:22:14.991 --> 00:22:19.970
<v Speaker 3>See that locks away all the chance for</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff to flow your way.</v>

437
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.580
<v Speaker 3>So good advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think today,</v>

438
00:22:22.581 --> 00:22:24.200
<v Speaker 3>start off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be thankful.</v>

439
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.150
<v Speaker 3>Here's number two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

440
00:22:26.151 --> 00:22:28.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna be a challenge today.</v>

441
00:22:28.881 --> 00:22:29.810
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That</v>

442
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 3>seems like most of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our life is still going on outside these</v>

443
00:22:36.311 --> 00:22:37.570
<v Speaker 3>four walls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

444
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:42.910
<v Speaker 3>Most of our life seems like it's out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Continuing out their family and business</v>

445
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 3>associates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>market and economy and whatever else is</v>

446
00:22:46.691 --> 00:22:51.691
<v Speaker 3>happening in the midst of your life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Sorta pull your attention from what's</v>

447
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:55.180
<v Speaker 3>going on out there and put it in here</v>
<v Speaker 3>for just a few hours.</v>

448
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.660
<v Speaker 3>I know is a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do the best you can.</v>

449
00:22:58.661 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

450
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.950
<v Speaker 3>here's the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take good notes.</v>

451
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.560
<v Speaker 3>Be a good student today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take some good notes.</v>

452
00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I have not come to entertain you as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can tell by my opening joke,</v>

453
00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:13.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not make it in Las Vegas so we</v>

454
00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:15.640
<v Speaker 3>don't have a dog and pony show today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No entertainment,</v>

455
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.000
<v Speaker 3>but I do have some ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take some good notes.</v>

456
00:23:19.001 --> 00:23:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Somebody showed me the other day notes</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they took about 21 years ago,</v>

457
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.290
<v Speaker 3>attending one of my seminars out in Los</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angeles.</v>

458
00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.630
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still use these notes.</v>

459
00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:33.631
<v Speaker 3>I took 21 years ago to help me in my</v>

<v Speaker 3>Be a student</v>

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.730
<v Speaker 3>We've got no movement for you to join.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just here to share some of my</v>

484
00:24:49.731 --> 00:24:51.190
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good ideas,</v>

485
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.320
<v Speaker 3>best I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's good advice.</v>

486
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Don't be a follower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be a student,</v>

487
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take advice,</v>

488
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:01.490
<v Speaker 3>but not orders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take information,</v>

489
00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:05.720
<v Speaker 3>but don't let somebody order your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make sure what you do is the product of</v>

490
00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:08.690
<v Speaker 3>your own conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excellent note to make.</v>

491
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Make sure what you do is the product of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own conclusion.</v>

492
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 3>Not to do what someone else says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take what someone else says,</v>

493
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:19.880
<v Speaker 3>process it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it,</v>

494
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.730
<v Speaker 3>ponder it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it makes you wonder,</v>

495
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:24.560
<v Speaker 3>if it makes you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's valuable.</v>

496
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Then when you go take action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that the action is not what</v>

497
00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:30.890
<v Speaker 3>somebody told you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make sure the action is the product of</v>

498
00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:31.970
<v Speaker 3>your own conclusion.</v>

499
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.740
<v Speaker 3>If you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>follow just a little bit of those simple</v>

500
00:25:36.741 --> 00:25:38.180
<v Speaker 3>guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

501
00:25:38.181 --> 00:25:40.640
<v Speaker 3>the learning process can be speedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swift,</v>

502
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.610
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your learning curve can go up and then</v>

503
00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:45.230
<v Speaker 3>applying it to your business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>

504
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.590
<v Speaker 3>your family conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>equities of all kinds.</v>

505
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.460
<v Speaker 3>You'll find some progress like I did</v>
<v Speaker 3>that first five years when I met a</v>

506
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:56.960
<v Speaker 3>teacher willing to share with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn my life around progress I couldn't</v>

507
00:25:56.961 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 3>believe happened for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

508
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.100
<v Speaker 3>let's get started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to review.</v>

509
00:26:04.101 --> 00:26:08.030
<v Speaker 3>I was here last time and we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the five major pieces to the life puzzle</v>

510
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.010
<v Speaker 3>and I just want to review those because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it lays such a good foundation for all</v>

511
00:26:17.011 --> 00:26:18.570
<v Speaker 3>the rest that I want to share with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

512
00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:21.810
<v Speaker 3>We've got a lot of subjects to cover so</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go rather swiftly.</v>

513
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put on your mental track shoes here and</v>

514
00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 3>run with me today because I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal mostly in concepts.</v>

515
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Expect you to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

516
00:26:29.581 --> 00:26:33.090
<v Speaker 3>fill in a lot of the details because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a lot to share.</v>

517
00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:36.570
<v Speaker 3>I want to get through it all but let's</v>
<v Speaker 3>lay this foundation again of the five</v>

518
00:26:36.571 --> 00:26:39.150
<v Speaker 3>major pieces happens to be the title of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my latest book,</v>

519
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.050
<v Speaker 3>but I think it is so valuable and laying</v>
<v Speaker 3>a foundation at some of the things I</v>

520
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:48.380
<v Speaker 3>between ages 25 and 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the teacher who taught me taught me so</v>

521
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:50.940
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He dealt in these fundamentals,</v>

522
00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:55.941
<v Speaker 3>we call these fundamentals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We call these basics</v>

523
00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.890
<v Speaker 3>basics for sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentals,</v>

524
00:27:00.891 --> 00:27:02.210
<v Speaker 3>for sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentals,</v>

525
00:27:02.211 --> 00:27:04.850
<v Speaker 3>for your business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentals for the way you deal with</v>

526
00:27:04.851 --> 00:27:06.830
<v Speaker 3>your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A few simple things,</v>

527
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.640
<v Speaker 3>few basic things that if you practice</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday can make all the difference in</v>

528
00:27:10.641 --> 00:27:12.290
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How it works out.</v>

529
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.470
<v Speaker 3>I boiled it down to five major pieces to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the life puzzle.</v>

530
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Let's just review those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number one is philosophy.</v>

531
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:18.703
<v Speaker 3>Philosophy.</v>

532
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.500
<v Speaker 3>Philosophy is I taught the last time I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was here.</v>

533
00:27:25.501 --> 00:27:30.360
<v Speaker 3>Philosophy in my personal opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the major determining factor in how</v>

534
00:27:30.361 --> 00:27:35.361
<v Speaker 3>your life works out philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the major determining factor in how your</v>

535
00:27:36.001 --> 00:27:40.230
<v Speaker 3>life works out philosophy to form our</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy.</v>

536
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.560
<v Speaker 3>You've got to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to use your mind to process ideas</v>

537
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.950
<v Speaker 3>and this whole process over a lifetime</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting way back here when we were</v>

538
00:27:49.951 --> 00:27:52.770
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>schools that we've attended,</v>

539
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:55.050
<v Speaker 3>our parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our experiences,</v>

540
00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:59.760
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff that we've processed by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thinking process helps to develop</v>

541
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 3>our philosophy and in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each person's personal philosophy is the</v>

542
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:08.721
<v Speaker 3>major factor in how your life works out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what I called it in that last</v>

543
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.360
<v Speaker 3>presentation when I was here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the set of the sail.</v>

544
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Each person's personal philosophy is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the set of the sail now,</v>

545
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I used to think of was circumstances</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ordered my life.</v>

546
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.560
<v Speaker 3>If someone would have asked me at age</v>
<v Speaker 3>25,</v>

547
00:28:22.561 --> 00:28:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Mr Owen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come you're not doing well?</v>

548
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Pennies in your pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creditors calling nothing in the bank</v>

549
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.870
<v Speaker 3>behind on your promises to your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You live in America.</v>

550
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Twenty five years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a beautiful family.</v>

551
00:28:36.601 --> 00:28:40.410
<v Speaker 3>Every reason to do well and things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going that well for you.</v>

552
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 3>What is wrong here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would not have occurred to me to</v>

553
00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:45.300
<v Speaker 3>blame my philosophy.</v>

554
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean it would not have occurred to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

555
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got this lousy philosophy and that's</v>

556
00:28:50.991 --> 00:28:54.050
<v Speaker 3>how come I got pennies in my pocket and</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing in the bank and things aren't</v>

557
00:28:54.051 --> 00:28:55.940
<v Speaker 3>working well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would not have occurred to me.</v>

558
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I found it much easier to blame the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

559
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:05.920
<v Speaker 3>Much easier to blame the tax problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to say taxes are too high.</v>

560
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Top tax rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I first started paying taxes,</v>

561
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.000
<v Speaker 3>91 percent</v>

562
00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.350
<v Speaker 3>back then when your income reached a</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain level,</v>

563
00:29:14.351 --> 00:29:18.640
<v Speaker 3>all your income over that 91 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I have to say that's too high.</v>

564
00:29:18.641 --> 00:29:21.730
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tax top tax rates about 33 percent,</v>

565
00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.450
<v Speaker 3>but people are still saying what taxes</v>
<v Speaker 3>are to see,</v>

566
00:29:25.451 --> 00:29:29.920
<v Speaker 3>but you can't use that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's gone from 91 to 33,</v>

567
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:30.930
<v Speaker 3>how could it be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do.</v>

568
00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:33.940
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

569
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I threw all that old excuse stuff away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people found it though and they're</v>

570
00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.670
<v Speaker 3>using it these days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My old list,</v>

571
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.890
<v Speaker 3>I used to blame the traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weather used to blame circumstances,</v>

572
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say I'm too tall.</v>

573
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:53.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm too short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm too old.</v>

574
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 3>I was raised in obscurity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raised on a farm.</v>

575
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Parents of modest means all the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had asked me,</v>

576
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:01.150
<v Speaker 3>how come you find yourself here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr Owens,</v>

577
00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.590
<v Speaker 3>age 25,</v>
<v Speaker 3>living in America,</v>

578
00:30:02.591 --> 00:30:06.070
<v Speaker 3>land of abundance and opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kenny's zero in the bank,</v>

579
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.960
<v Speaker 3>not doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creditors calling.</v>

580
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 3>It would not have occurred to me to</v>
<v Speaker 3>blame my philosophy.</v>

581
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.020
<v Speaker 3>I found it easier to blame the company</v>
<v Speaker 3>company policy.</v>

582
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 3>I used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is all they pay,</v>

583
00:30:18.281 --> 00:30:23.210
<v Speaker 3>how do they expect you to do well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I figured that you know,</v>

584
00:30:23.211 --> 00:30:26.660
<v Speaker 3>my future was going to be tied to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else was arranging the</v>

585
00:30:26.661 --> 00:30:28.520
<v Speaker 3>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

586
00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Interest rates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to say things cost too much.</v>

587
00:30:32.091 --> 00:30:36.740
<v Speaker 3>That was my whole explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not my philosophy until my teacher</v>

588
00:30:36.741 --> 00:30:38.930
<v Speaker 3>taught me better that this is where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem was.</v>

589
00:30:38.931 --> 00:30:43.040
<v Speaker 3>My own personal philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what's exciting about each</v>

590
00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:46.160
<v Speaker 3>person's personal philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes us different than dogs</v>

591
00:30:46.161 --> 00:30:49.700
<v Speaker 3>and animals and birds and cats and</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiders and alligators.</v>

592
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.660
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes us different than all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the life forms.</v>

593
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.550
<v Speaker 3>The ability to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ability to use your mind,</v>

594
00:30:56.551 --> 00:31:00.420
<v Speaker 3>the ability to process id is and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>just operate by instinct</v>

595
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.270
<v Speaker 3>in the winter and I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goose can only fly south.</v>

596
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.720
<v Speaker 3>South doesn't look too good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough luck.</v>

597
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.770
<v Speaker 3>It can only fly south,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see,</v>

598
00:31:15.771 --> 00:31:19.220
<v Speaker 3>human beings are not like a goose can</v>
<v Speaker 3>only fly south.</v>

599
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can turn around and go north.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go east,</v>

600
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.850
<v Speaker 3>you can go west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can order the entire process of your</v>

601
00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:31.050
<v Speaker 3>own life and we do that by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We think we do that by exercising our</v>

602
00:31:31.051 --> 00:31:33.870
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do that by processing ideas and come</v>

603
00:31:33.871 --> 00:31:37.950
<v Speaker 3>up with a better philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a better strategy for our life goals for</v>

604
00:31:37.951 --> 00:31:39.230
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

605
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Plans to achieve those goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this comes from developing our</v>

606
00:31:42.931 --> 00:31:47.090
<v Speaker 3>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Philosophy helps us to process what's</v>

607
00:31:47.091 --> 00:31:48.410
<v Speaker 3>available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

608
00:31:48.411 --> 00:31:52.430
<v Speaker 3>when we get here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got seed and we got soil and we got</v>

609
00:31:52.431 --> 00:31:57.431
<v Speaker 3>some rain and we've got some hot</v>
<v Speaker 3>sunshine and we've got some seasons and</v>

610
00:31:59.901 --> 00:32:04.901
<v Speaker 3>what the miracle of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the key is what do you do with all</v>

611
00:32:05.151 --> 00:32:05.984
<v Speaker 3>this stuff?</v>

612
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:12.860
<v Speaker 3>How do you turn all this stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>available here into equity and promise</v>

613
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:19.790
<v Speaker 3>and lifestyle and dreams and future</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities.</v>

614
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.570
<v Speaker 3>All of this that's possible now with</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

615
00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:29.550
<v Speaker 3>How do you take all this stuff and turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>it into this equities and values?</v>

616
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it starts with philosophy.</v>

617
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.670
<v Speaker 3>What is the seed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the soil?</v>

618
00:32:34.671 --> 00:32:36.300
<v Speaker 3>It is the sunshine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the rain?</v>

619
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible to take some of each of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the stuff that's available and turn</v>

620
00:32:40.561 --> 00:32:44.480
<v Speaker 3>it into food and turn it into value and</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn it into nourishment,</v>

621
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.740
<v Speaker 3>turn it into something spectacular and</v>
<v Speaker 3>unique that no other life form can do,</v>

622
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:53.030
<v Speaker 3>and the answer's yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you cannot deal with all this stuff</v>

623
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 3>and what to do with it unless you start</v>
<v Speaker 3>refining your philosophy.</v>

624
00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.590
<v Speaker 3>Think use your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come up with ideas and strengthen your</v>

625
00:33:00.591 --> 00:33:02.900
<v Speaker 3>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the seed in the soil and the rain and</v>

626
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:05.960
<v Speaker 3>the sunshine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is called you know the economy and</v>

627
00:33:05.961 --> 00:33:10.961
<v Speaker 3>the banks and the money and the schools</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything that's available out</v>

628
00:33:12.471 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>processing information.</v>

629
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:18.740
<v Speaker 3>What to do with all that and turn it</v>
<v Speaker 3>into equity and value.</v>

630
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.200
<v Speaker 3>That is the major challenge of life.</v>

631
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 3>My personal opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so each person's personal philosophy now</v>

632
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:27.860
<v Speaker 3>is going to determine what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do with seed and soil and sunshine</v>

633
00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:30.500
<v Speaker 3>and rain miracle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the change of seasons.</v>

634
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.840
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My personal opinion,</v>

635
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.720
<v Speaker 3>each person's personal philosophy is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the set of the sail.</v>

636
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.760
<v Speaker 3>That's what the seminars for today help</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to trim a better sale.</v>

637
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 3>You don't need a better economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need better seed and soil.</v>

638
00:33:45.501 --> 00:33:48.230
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to seed and soil and rain</v>

639
00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:50.360
<v Speaker 3>and sunshine and seasons and the miracle</v>
<v Speaker 3>of life,</v>

640
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.090
<v Speaker 3>that's all you got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

641
00:33:53.091 --> 00:33:56.600
<v Speaker 3>what if you blame this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're blaming all you got.</v>

642
00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.390
<v Speaker 3>If you blame the economy and you blame</v>
<v Speaker 3>the schools and you blame the teachers</v>

643
00:34:03.391 --> 00:34:05.450
<v Speaker 3>and he blamed the sermons and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>preachers and,</v>

644
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.900
<v Speaker 3>and you blame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

645
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.990
<v Speaker 3>you know the marketplace and you blame</v>
<v Speaker 3>the company and company policy.</v>

646
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.010
<v Speaker 3>What else is there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When some people get through with their</v>

647
00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.850
<v Speaker 3>blame list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is nothing else.</v>

648
00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:20.150
<v Speaker 3>That's all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you blame the only thing you've</v>

649
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.320
<v Speaker 3>got to work with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

650
00:34:22.321 --> 00:34:24.690
<v Speaker 3>it's called mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>colossal</v>

651
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.710
<v Speaker 3>and not understanding that that's all</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to work with.</v>

652
00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:31.600
<v Speaker 3>And if this is all you've got to work</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

653
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:35.620
<v Speaker 3>then you don't change the seed and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't change the soil and you don't</v>

654
00:34:35.621 --> 00:34:38.380
<v Speaker 3>change the rain and you don't change the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sun sign.</v>

655
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.840
<v Speaker 3>You don't change the seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

656
00:34:40.841 --> 00:34:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Guy Says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take three springs,</v>

657
00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.150
<v Speaker 3>four summers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine falls,</v>

658
00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.690
<v Speaker 3>no winters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

659
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.210
<v Speaker 3>you can't fool with this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to take it like it comes.</v>

660
00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Then what do you change to make your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life work?</v>

661
00:34:54.401 --> 00:34:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta start with your philosophy.</v>

662
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to do at age 25.</v>

663
00:35:00.341 --> 00:35:03.940
<v Speaker 3>In order to change my own future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to change my mind.</v>

664
00:35:03.941 --> 00:35:06.760
<v Speaker 3>I had to change my thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to change my philosophy.</v>

665
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:11.050
<v Speaker 3>I was messed up on what was causing my</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem and once I got that straightened</v>

666
00:35:11.051 --> 00:35:15.540
<v Speaker 3>out that all the stuff I blamed the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government and taxes and the marketplace</v>

667
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.780
<v Speaker 3>and the economy and things cost too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative relatives,</v>

668
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.090
<v Speaker 3>cynical neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I got rid of that and started going</v>

669
00:35:22.091 --> 00:35:24.370
<v Speaker 3>for where the real problem was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was me,</v>

670
00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life exploded into change.</v>

671
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:30.400
<v Speaker 3>My bank account changed immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My income changed immediately.</v>

672
00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.540
<v Speaker 3>My whole life took on a whole new look</v>
<v Speaker 3>and color immediately,</v>

673
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:39.750
<v Speaker 3>and the early results I got from making</v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophical changes tasted so good.</v>

674
00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.120
<v Speaker 3>I've never stopped the process from that</v>
<v Speaker 3>day until this,</v>

675
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.440
<v Speaker 3>and I'm telling you with a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration of the refinement of your</v>

676
00:35:46.441 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 3>sale by setting a better sale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>refining your philosophy,</v>

677
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.680
<v Speaker 3>your whole life can start to change from</v>
<v Speaker 3>today on.</v>

678
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.100
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to wait till tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to wait til next month.</v>

679
00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:00.120
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to wait until spring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't have to wait until 93.</v>

680
00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.520
<v Speaker 3>You can start this whole process</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>

681
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.300
<v Speaker 3>I recommend it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people do so little thinking they</v>

682
00:36:06.301 --> 00:36:09.350
<v Speaker 3>don't even have their sale up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can imagine where they're</v>

683
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.100
<v Speaker 3>going to wind up at the end of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>

684
00:36:11.101 --> 00:36:13.410
<v Speaker 3>at the end of this month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of this year.</v>

685
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 3>Now is the chance to change process all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this information.</v>

686
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.720
<v Speaker 3>So number one is philosophy and we dealt</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all that.</v>
