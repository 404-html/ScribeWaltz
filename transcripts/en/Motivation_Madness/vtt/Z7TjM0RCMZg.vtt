1
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Right now is that we have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who want to build brands who want</v>

2
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>to become influencers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who want to start companies,</v>

3
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.580
<v Speaker 1>but they're not putting in the pieces</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually allowed them to weather</v>

4
00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I'm most proud of is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>two biggest businesses I've ever built.</v>

6
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I basically started them during very</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult times when I first got</v>

7
00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>involved in my dad's liquor store</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>It was the late nineties and just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and a half into my journey,</v>

9
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I guess two years into my journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stock market crashed and all the</v>

10
00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Internet companies folded and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were making money that I was</v>

11
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>targeting to sell wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped having money to buy wine and Ip</v>

12
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.530
<v Speaker 1>and then right behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of my business was New York</v>

13
00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:49.450
<v Speaker 1>and New Jersey based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though we were building an internet</v>

14
00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>company was only about a year later that</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 happened.</v>

15
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>And not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for anybody that lived in New</v>

17
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.881
<v Speaker 1>York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey area.</v>

18
00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:01.330
<v Speaker 1>It was much more compounded for us</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we lost loved ones.</v>

19
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.070
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I lost 100 employees from</v>
<v Speaker 1>one organization in one day,</v>

20
00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I had to go in the hand by hand and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>their emails out because everybody</v>

21
00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>passed away from Cantor Fitzgerald that</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked in that office so and that.</v>

22
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.990
<v Speaker 1>So I persevered through that because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was practical because I didn't have a</v>

23
00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>lot of overhead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because I wasn't romantic,</v>

24
00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I had a buy and sell wine</v>

25
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.350
<v Speaker 1>and liquor and beer and I had to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that my expenses weren't greater</v>

26
00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:31.351
<v Speaker 1>than the money I was bringing in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vaynermedia started in the actions of</v>

27
00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>the economic meltdown of the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S when I started Vaynermedia,</v>

28
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 1>people didn't want to pay $5,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone the 50 or a hundred thousand.</v>

29
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 1>They pay us a month now for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

30
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.100
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I started vayner media,</v>

31
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

32
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I watch everybody watched my journey</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

33
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that cliche thing of like</v>

34
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>overnight success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have this TV show come out</v>
<v Speaker 1>this June and it's going to change my</v>

36
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:56.501
<v Speaker 1>profile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sit on the stage with will</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am and Gwyneth Paltrow,</v>

38
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Jessica Alba for this apple show that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to do,</v>

39
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.030
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's gonna say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you come from that happened</v>

40
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:08.260
<v Speaker 1>overnight and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's even really happened in social.</v>

41
00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of you,</v>

42
00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>you've only really even have known about</v>
<v Speaker 1>me for the last six months or so even</v>

43
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:16.900
<v Speaker 1>though I had been putting out content</v>
<v Speaker 1>online for 10 years every single day.</v>

44
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>And so the thing that I've been really</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about is practicality,</v>

45
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.870
<v Speaker 1>like vayner media.</v>

46
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Even though I had already built a nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>size business,</v>

47
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like I was extracting a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money out of wine library.</v>

48
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And so when age and I started vayner</v>
<v Speaker 1>media seven years ago,</v>

49
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 1>we started it out of a company called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddy media is conference room.</v>

50
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>For the first two years that I ran</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaynermedia.</v>

51
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.920
<v Speaker 1>We had no rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We first worked out of a conference</v>

52
00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conference room.</v>

53
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.840
<v Speaker 1>We then worked out of a coworking space</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the whole.</v>

54
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:51.841
<v Speaker 1>We work in coworking space revolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I bartered my time to help that</v>

55
00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>company in exchange for a very small</v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

56
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>We didn't buy furniture we scrapped and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd already made it.</v>

57
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I was already rich and we scrapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the biggest thing that I want to</v>

58
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>implore everybody here today to do is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a step back and think about how</v>

59
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>fancy are they?</v>

60
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Are you willing to be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

61
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>really ghetto?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really need that chair?</v>

62
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you really need that piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology?</v>

63
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you really need to fly that class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just think that we're living</v>

64
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>through an incredibly fancy culture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship,</v>

65
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship and CEO Status is quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexy.</v>

66
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>People are selling a lifestyle that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with lots of fun and trips and,</v>

67
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>and champagne and bikini's and bling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bling and all sorts of horse shit.</v>

68
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

69
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just think that that era of this</v>

70
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>era is going to come to an end somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the next five years.</v>

71
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>And very honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want a lot of people in</v>

72
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>this room that dream to build their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses to have to go work at a bank</v>

73
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>or go work at a retail store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would highly recommend</v>

74
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>something that I think is stunningly not</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about enough,</v>

75
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>which is if you're building a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be making money.</v>

76
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>And so I know that's like a funny thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

77
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the other thing that's important</v>

78
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 1>is to shift the context completely the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other way,</v>

79
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 1>which is what is really winning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

80
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the definition of winning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we all have different</v>

81
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>definitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

82
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think that one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also want to say is that I'm getting</v>

83
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>scared that a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>following my journey here,</v>

84
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:42.280
<v Speaker 1>me talking about buying the New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>jets and I do aspire to buy a</v>

85
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>$3,000,000,000 sports franchise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

86
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>It is what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

87
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>You can look at my fifth grade yearbook</v>
<v Speaker 1>long before business was cool.</v>

88
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 1>It's what I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm awfully scared that it's</v>

89
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>pressuring the people that follow me</v>
<v Speaker 1>into trying to achieve things that they</v>

90
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily want.</v>

91
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>They just think it's the thing you do if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to be a successful</v>

92
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>businessperson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me promise you something.</v>

93
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I know tens of thousands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know thousands of people extremely</v>

94
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know hundreds of people deeply.</v>

95
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no correlation between how much</v>

96
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>money someone makes and their level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

97
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I have friends who make $47,000 a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and are the happiest people I know their</v>

98
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:23.920
<v Speaker 1>work life balances on point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're part of two soccer teams.</v>

99
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>They play video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They watch every show they want.</v>

100
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>They take two vacations that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>scrapped together and they're freaking</v>

101
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>happiest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell and I know tons of people who I</v>

102
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>grew up within the silicon valley boom</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have hundreds of millions of dollars</v>

103
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>in their bank account and are as</v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable and as lonely and as broken as</v>

104
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you'll ever see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I implore all of you to please</v>

105
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:50.230
<v Speaker 1>reverse engineer and figure out who you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and figure out what level of</v>

106
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.100
<v Speaker 1>monetizing and stuff you need and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of creativity needed.</v>

107
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I promise you one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that will catch you off guard</v>

108
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>my should be way more rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I leave money on the table every day.</v>

109
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I've left ungodly amounts of money on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the table.</v>

110
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I spend tons of times spending sending</v>
<v Speaker 1>dms and engaging with people and meeting</v>

111
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>people randomly and not cashing in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually believe the statement I'm</v>

112
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 1>about to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that I love the journey and the</v>

113
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:25.421
<v Speaker 1>game of entrepreneurship so much that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have subconsciously sabotaged my</v>

114
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>financial upside to make sure I can play</v>
<v Speaker 1>this a little longer because I fear if</v>

115
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>the numbers keep getting too big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually it will take the fun out of</v>

116
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were lucky enough like I am to</v>

117
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:40.690
<v Speaker 1>actually do something that you love so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

118
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 1>do something that puts pressure against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one thing you care about besides it,</v>

119
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 1>which is the time I spend with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

120
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.930
<v Speaker 1>my family is my whole life and being</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and doing this is the only thing</v>

121
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:57.500
<v Speaker 1>that cuts into that I couldn't breathe</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I wasn't an entrepreneur.</v>

122
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't breathe when I wasn't an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur.</v>

123
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason I got d's and f's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>school because I just couldn't be me and</v>

124
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:10.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm not capable of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think being here excites me</v>

125
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>because I think coming to not la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco,</v>

126
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>London is always more fun for me.</v>

127
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 1>It always feels a little more practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always feels like there's a little</v>

128
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 1>bit more chips on the shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what I have,</v>

129
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 1>but I want to remind everybody just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you didn't grow up with a trust</v>

130
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>fund,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you don't live in silicon</v>

131
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the market doesn't care if you're good</v>

132
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will win and I hope that you don't.</v>

133
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

134
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.920
<v Speaker 1>And if you sit around and ponder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

135
00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:48.921
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't live here or if my mom</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't an alcoholic or if I just learned</v>

136
00:07:49.441 --> 00:07:52.050
<v Speaker 1>about this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if I had been following this person</v>

137
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.200
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if I wasn't born a woman or if I</v>

138
00:07:55.201 --> 00:07:57.810
<v Speaker 1>wasn't born a minority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you sit and do that,</v>

139
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.590
<v Speaker 1>you are losing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not wrong.</v>

140
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.760
<v Speaker 1>It's just that business and marketing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this doesn't care.</v>

141
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 1>They're just no emotion in the market</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

142
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think we need to start having</v>

143
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.890
<v Speaker 1>much deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more serious conversations of</v>

144
00:08:16.891 --> 00:08:18.990
<v Speaker 1>practicality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

145
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.440
<v Speaker 1>it's fun and I love this space the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I loved it long before it was sexy.</v>

146
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.320
<v Speaker 1>I loved it long before people want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take selfies with me.</v>

147
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I loved it long before athletes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrities and rappers want it to be</v>

148
00:08:32.671 --> 00:08:34.890
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it long before that,</v>

149
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.410
<v Speaker 1>it was my destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was who I was.</v>

150
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.170
<v Speaker 1>It was how I was wired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the only thing I knew.</v>

151
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.030
<v Speaker 1>That's why the four year old me ripped</v>
<v Speaker 1>flowers out of yards and sold it.</v>

152
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't read about being an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur at five,</v>

153
00:08:49.921 --> 00:08:50.551
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

154
00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:51.384
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nine.</v>

155
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't jump on this because it's cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and it makes me money and I did it</v>

156
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's all I ever was and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>implore you,</v>

157
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>if you came here to be an entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this talk allows you to realize</v>

158
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 1>you're really an artist or you're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number three in a company because you</v>

159
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>bring this level of energy and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be a number one because let me</v>

160
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 1>promise you something about being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one.</v>

161
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an entrepreneur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a firefighter.</v>

162
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.400
<v Speaker 1>My entire life is taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crap.</v>

163
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Putting out fires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four slash seven,</v>

164
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 1>three 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole life is this is a problem.</v>

165
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Fix this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and guess what?</v>

166
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 1>When you're the last line of defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no blaming your boss.</v>

167
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.850
<v Speaker 1>There's no blaming the logo.</v>

168
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 1>There's no blaming the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all my fault,</v>

169
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's super sexy,</v>

170
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.070
<v Speaker 1>but what's not being talked about is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and acquaintances I have who've</v>

171
00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:53.220
<v Speaker 1>committed suicide in the entrepreneurial</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the last four years because nobody</v>

172
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 1>talks about the downside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks they're going to be</v>

173
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 1>zucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks they're gonna.</v>

174
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Build snapchat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go look at the data.</v>

175
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 1>The data shows that the far majority of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this room will not succeed,</v>

176
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>not even close to building an actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

177
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 1>and I don't come here to be somber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come here to remind you that there's</v>

178
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:18.291
<v Speaker 1>only one thing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you can do that can trump</v>

179
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.850
<v Speaker 1>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mommy and daddy had sex to make you the</v>

180
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>only thing that can trump that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that can trump your dna,</v>

181
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:30.570
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that is controllable if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want it,</v>

182
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 1>if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is work.</v>

183
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

184
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Only tangible and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you guys have noticed.</v>

185
00:10:44.801 --> 00:10:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I've stopped even funny given the name</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the conference I've started.</v>

186
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:53.050
<v Speaker 1>I've started using the word work more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the word hustle just because I want</v>

187
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.720
<v Speaker 1>everybody to understand what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>really talking about here.</v>

188
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.840
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a big mouth and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do here,</v>

189
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.720
<v Speaker 1>search the Hashtag and a lot of you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>ceo,</v>

190
00:11:01.721 --> 00:11:02.800
<v Speaker 1>founder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>owner.</v>

191
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I call that big mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got the audacity to do it,</v>

192
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.780
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so many of you've heard this from me</v>

193
00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:14.140
<v Speaker 1>when I audit you and I do because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>curious.</v>

194
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.050
<v Speaker 1>It's how I learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People talk a big game.</v>

195
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I especially loved when somebody hits me</v>
<v Speaker 1>up on social,</v>

196
00:11:19.361 --> 00:11:21.550
<v Speaker 1>like Gary V,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna buy the jets.</v>

197
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy the rams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

198
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.800
<v Speaker 1>everybody is buying a sports team and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>love and I love to look at what that</v>

199
00:11:29.801 --> 00:11:33.730
<v Speaker 1>person does and then I'll dm that person</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>

200
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Yo bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

201
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.040
<v Speaker 1>nobody.</v>

202
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Unless they were a trust fund baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever bought the rams.</v>

203
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.250
<v Speaker 1>When they go skiing for a week when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're 24,</v>

204
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.120
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.840
<v Speaker 1>nobody you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody you know has become successful</v>

206
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.200
<v Speaker 1>outside of it being given to them from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their family.</v>

207
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Nobody you know has actually created</v>
<v Speaker 1>success without working their face off.</v>

208
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.620
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can sit and talk about luck and</v>

209
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:11.290
<v Speaker 1>you can sit and talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

210
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 1>or the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I promise you,</v>

211
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 1>the only controllable thing you have is</v>
<v Speaker 1>your work ethic.</v>

212
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>So going back to the beginning of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

213
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:26.190
<v Speaker 1>you need to deploy serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious self awareness and figuring out</v>

214
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:30.790
<v Speaker 1>who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I implore you to start matching your</v>

215
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 1>work ethic and your actions to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

216
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.340
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be a billionaire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to realize that most people</v>

217
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:44.341
<v Speaker 1>that create billion dollars worth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth don't do anything besides work</v>

218
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.980
<v Speaker 1>every single day of their twenties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties.</v>

219
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Speaker 1>All of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every person that works at Vaynermedia</v>

220
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:58.110
<v Speaker 1>has taken more vacations in the last 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>months than I did in my entire twenties</v>

221
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 1>and early thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My family went on to family vacations my</v>

222
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:07.120
<v Speaker 1>entire childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was married to my wife for five years</v>

223
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 1>before we had a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We took two vacations.</v>

224
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It's the price you have to pay if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want it at the level that I wanted at.</v>

225
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I advise nobody to want it at that</v>

226
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being dead serious.</v>

227
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 1>This is a very true statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most of you will not believe,</v>

228
00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the goddamn truth.</v>

229
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.350
<v Speaker 1>If there was a drug that could take some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambition out,</v>

230
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I would take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is so extreme.</v>

231
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 1>It is all in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I started daily Vee was to</v>

232
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:44.800
<v Speaker 1>remind you that I'm out working you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you talk and you're trying to</v>

233
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 1>figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying to say,</v>

234

<v Speaker 1>you're going to be like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to see it.</v>

238
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what it takes for what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good news is between what I want and</v>

239
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:10.570
<v Speaker 1>what is achievable and it's considered</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably all time.</v>

240

<v Speaker 1>so there's plenty of vacation time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>pay the price.</v>
