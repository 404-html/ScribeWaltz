00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Put God first.</v>

2
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 1>God first in every thing you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you think you see in me,</v>

3
00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>everything that I've accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you think I have and I</v>

4
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:31.810
<v Speaker 1>have a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that I have is by the grace</v>

5
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that it's a gift.</v>

6
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 1>40 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>March 27th,</v>

7
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>1975 it was 40 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just this past march,</v>

8
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I was flunking out of college at a 1.7</v>
<v Speaker 1>grade point average.</v>

9
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I hope none of you can relate</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a 1.7 grade point average.</v>

10
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting in my mother's beauty</v>
<v Speaker 1>shop.</v>

11
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.590
<v Speaker 1>They still call it beauty shops now when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it now.</v>

12
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll sit in the beauty parlor.</v>

13
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.370
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting in my mother's beauty</v>
<v Speaker 1>pollock and I'm looking in the mirror</v>

14
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>and I see behind me this woman under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dryer and every time she looked up,</v>

15
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I looked up,</v>

16
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:15.160
<v Speaker 1>she was looking at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just look at me in the eye and I didn't</v>

17
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:16.820
<v Speaker 1>know who she was and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody give me a pen,</v>

19
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>give me a pencil.</v>

20
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I have a prophecy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>March 27 1975 she said,</v>

21
00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to travel the world and</v>

22
00:01:26.591 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>speak to millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I a flunked out of college?</v>

23
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about joining the army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I was going to do and</v>

24
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 1>she's telling me I'm going to travel</v>
<v Speaker 1>there world and speak to millions of</v>

25
00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I have traveled the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have spoken to millions of people,</v>

27
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the most important thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to success that I had.</v>

28
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:50.680
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing is that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>she taught me,</v>

29
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.520
<v Speaker 1>what she told me that day has stayed</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

30
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I've been protected,</v>

31
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I've been directed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been correct.</v>

32
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>I've kept God in my life and has kept me</v>
<v Speaker 1>humble.</v>

33
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I didn't always stick with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he always stuck with me.</v>

34
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>So stick with them in everything you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think you want to do what you</v>

35
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:18.370
<v Speaker 1>think I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then do what I've done and stick with</v>

36
00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

37
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail big.</v>

38
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fail big.</v>

39
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Today's the beginning of the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life and it can be,</v>

40
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:31.580
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Be very frightening.</v>

41
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a new world out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mean world out there and you only</v>

42
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 1>live once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do what you feel passionate about,</v>

43
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>passionate about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take chances professionally.</v>

44
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Don't be afraid to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an old Iq test was nine dots and</v>

45
00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:54.881
<v Speaker 1>you had to draw five lines with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pencil within these nine dots without</v>

46
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>lifting the pencil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way to do it was to go outside</v>

47
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't be afraid to go outside the</v>

48
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:07.921
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be afraid to think outside the</v>

49
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be afraid to fail,</v>

50
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>big to dream big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But remember,</v>

51
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.760
<v Speaker 1>dreams without goals are just dreams and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ultimately fuel disappointment.</v>

52
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.480
<v Speaker 1>So have dreams but have goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life goals,</v>

53
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.810
<v Speaker 1>yearly goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monthly goals,</v>

54
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.660
<v Speaker 1>daily goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to give myself a goal every day.</v>

55
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Time is just to not curse somebody out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simple goals,</v>

56
00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:51.491
<v Speaker 1>but have goals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and understand that to achieve these</v>

57
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:56.030
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must apply discipline</v>

58
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.360
<v Speaker 1>and consistency</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to achieve your goals.</v>

59
00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:05.240
<v Speaker 1>You must apply discipline which you</v>
<v Speaker 1>already done,</v>

60
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and consistency every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just one Tuesday and miss a few</v>

61
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.950
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to work at it every day.</v>

62
00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:16.550
<v Speaker 1>You have to plan every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've heard the saying,</v>

63
00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:21.551
<v Speaker 1>we don't plan to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fail to plan hard work works.</v>

64
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Working really hard is what successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do.</v>

65
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>And in this text tweet torque world that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've grown up in,</v>

66
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.650
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you're doing a lot more</v>

67
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.070
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you're getting a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

68
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Remember that just because you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more</v>

69
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you're getting a lot more</v>

70
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.863
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

71
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Don't confuse movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>with progress.</v>

72
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>My mother told me she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

73
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can run in place all the time</v>

74
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:11.190
<v Speaker 1>and never get anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So continue to strive and can you to</v>

75
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:16.191
<v Speaker 1>have goals continue to progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>

76
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll never see a u haul behind a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearse.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You'll never see a u haul behind a</v>

78
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:31.770
<v Speaker 1>hearse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how much money you make,</v>

79
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you can't take it with you via Gypson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

81
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.090
<v Speaker 1>You can't take it with you and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you have.</v>

82
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.650
<v Speaker 1>It's what you do with what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have different talents.</v>

83
00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Some of you will be doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some lawyers,</v>

<v Speaker 1>some nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some teaching.</v>

86
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.080
<v Speaker 1>So I'm preachers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most selfish thing you can do in</v>

87
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>this world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is helps someone else.</v>

88
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Why is it selfish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the gratification,</v>

89
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>the goodness that comes to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good feeling,</v>

90
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 1>the good feeling that I get from helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

91
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

92
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>one or two things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing's better than that.</v>

93
00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Not Not Jewelry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not big house.</v>

94
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I have not cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the joy.</v>

95
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 1>That's where the joy is in helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

96
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>That's where the success is in helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

97
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Sit beforehand or ready to indicate that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's yours and anything you want,</v>

119
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.040
<v Speaker 1>good you can have</v>
<v Speaker 1>so claim it.</v>

120
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Work hard to get it when you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reach back.</v>

121
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Pull someone else up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each one.</v>

122
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Teach one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't just aspire to make a living</v>

123
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.440
<v Speaker 1>and aspire to make a difference.</v>

124
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Every failed experiment is one step</v>
<v Speaker 3>closer to success.</v>

125
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.750
<v Speaker 3>You've got to take risks and I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've probably heard that before,</v>

126
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.540
<v Speaker 3>but I want to talk to you about why</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so important.</v>

127
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.543
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

128
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 3>I got three reasons and then you can up</v>
<v Speaker 3>your iphone</v>

129
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.673
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

130
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.540
<v Speaker 3>You will fail at some point in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

131
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.550
<v Speaker 3>except it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will lose,</v>

132
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.090
<v Speaker 3>you will embarrass yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will suck at something.</v>

133
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.410
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about it.</v>

134
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

135
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.210
<v Speaker 3>I know that's probably not a traditional</v>
<v Speaker 3>message for a graduation ceremony,</v>

136
00:09:14.211 --> 00:09:15.950
<v Speaker 3>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

137
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.100
<v Speaker 3>embrace it because it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I should know in the acting</v>

138
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:23.600
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fail all the time.</v>

139
00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:27.590
<v Speaker 3>Early on in my career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I auditioned for a part in a broadway</v>

140
00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:30.080
<v Speaker 3>musical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect role for me.</v>

141
00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:33.200
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except for the fact that I can't sing.</v>

142
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.600
<v Speaker 3>So I'm in the wings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm about to go onstage,</v>

143
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.180
<v Speaker 3>but the guy in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's singing like,</v>

144
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.730
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Pavarotti.</v>

145
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 3>He's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just</v>

146
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.840
<v Speaker 3>gone on and on and on and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 3>shrinking and getting smaller and</v>

147
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:53.030
<v Speaker 3>smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you say,</v>

148
00:09:53.031 --> 00:09:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much,</v>

149
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:55.610
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>

150
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.690
<v Speaker 3>you'll be hearing from us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I come out with my little sheet music</v>

151
00:09:59.691 --> 00:10:01.580
<v Speaker 3>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

152
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jess,</v>

153
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:05.990
<v Speaker 3>my imagination by the temptations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I came up with.</v>

154
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.420
<v Speaker 3>So I hand it to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

155
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:09.530
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the accompany us.</v>

156
00:10:09.531 --> 00:10:10.340
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

157
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.830
<v Speaker 3>she looks at it and looks at me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>looks at it,</v>

158
00:10:12.831 --> 00:10:13.880
<v Speaker 3>the director,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's was like,</v>

159
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.423
<v Speaker 2>hi.</v>

160
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.530
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I start,</v>

161
00:10:18.531 --> 00:10:20.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sing.</v>

162
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.213
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

163
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:30.260
<v Speaker 2>say again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can away with me</v>

164
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.220
<v Speaker 3>and then not saying anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm thinking I'm getting better.</v>

165
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.280
<v Speaker 3>I started getting into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes ma'am.</v>

166
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Rania thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

168
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much Mr. Washington.</v>

169
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I assumed I didn't get the job,</v>

170
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.140
<v Speaker 3>but the next part of the audition he</v>
<v Speaker 3>called me back the next party.</v>

171
00:10:52.141 --> 00:10:54.750
<v Speaker 3>The audition is the acting part of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>audition.</v>

172
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:55.771
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

173
00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:56.401
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

174
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 3>maybe I can't sing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know I can act.</v>

175
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 3>So they pair me with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

176
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know about musical theater and</v>
<v Speaker 3>musical theater is big so they can reach</v>

177
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 3>everyone that all the way in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stadium.</v>

178
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.290
<v Speaker 3>And I'm more from a realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>naturalistic kind of acting where you,</v>

179
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually talked to the person next</v>

180
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:17.300
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I the,</v>

181
00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what my line was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My line was will hand me the cup and his</v>

182
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:22.980
<v Speaker 3>line was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

183
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:24.610
<v Speaker 3>I will hand you the cup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My idea,</v>

184
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 3>the cup would be there to be handed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

185
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

186
00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.403
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

187
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.263
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

188
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

189
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Should I give you the cup back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>

190
00:11:39.351 --> 00:11:41.270
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give it back to me because you know that</v>

191
00:11:41.271 --> 00:11:44.840
<v Speaker 3>is my cup and it should be given back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

192
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get the job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing.</v>

193
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I didn't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't fall back.</v>

194
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.570
<v Speaker 2>I walked out of there to prepare for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next door edition and the next door</v>

195
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 2>audition and the next door audition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I prayed,</v>

196
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 2>I prayed and I prayed.</v>

197
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.040
<v Speaker 3>But I continue to fail and fail and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fail,</v>

198
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.510
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't matter because you know</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

199
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.740
<v Speaker 3>there's an old saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hang around the barbershop long</v>

200
00:12:24.741 --> 00:12:26.090
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sooner or later you're going to get a</v>

201
00:12:26.091 --> 00:12:30.530
<v Speaker 3>haircut</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you will catch a break.</v>

202
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.600
<v Speaker 3>And I did catch a break</v>
<v Speaker 3>last year.</v>

203
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.810
<v Speaker 3>I did a play called fences on Broadway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone talked about it,</v>

204
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.980
<v Speaker 3>won the Tony Award,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't have to sing by the way,</v>

205
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 3>but here's the kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was at the court theater.</v>

206
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.920
<v Speaker 3>It was at the same theater that I failed</v>
<v Speaker 3>that first audition 30 years prior</v>

207
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.010
<v Speaker 3>point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll pick up the pace.</v>

208
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.220
<v Speaker 3>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every graduate here today has the</v>

209
00:13:10.221 --> 00:13:15.221
<v Speaker 3>training and the talent to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you have the guts to fail?</v>

210
00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.120
<v Speaker 3>Here's my second point about failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't fail,</v>

211
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.250
<v Speaker 3>you're not even trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it again.</v>

212
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.920
<v Speaker 3>If you don't fail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not even trying.</v>

213
00:13:27.921 --> 00:13:32.030
<v Speaker 3>My wife told me this great expression to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get something you never had.</v>

214
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:37.150
<v Speaker 3>You have to do something you never did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Les Brown is a motivational speaker.</v>

215
00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:39.500
<v Speaker 3>He made an analogy about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

216
00:13:39.501 --> 00:13:43.430
<v Speaker 3>imagine you're on your deathbed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing around your deathbed are the</v>

217
00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:46.490
<v Speaker 3>ghosts representing your unfulfilled</v>
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>

218
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.600
<v Speaker 3>The ghost of the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never acted on the ghost of the</v>

219
00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:54.290
<v Speaker 3>talent you didn't use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're standing around your bed</v>

220
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.360
<v Speaker 3>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disappointed,</v>

221
00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.280
<v Speaker 3>and upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>

222
00:13:58.281 --> 00:14:01.100
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we came to you because you could have</v>

223
00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:02.240
<v Speaker 3>brought us to life.</v>

224
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.210
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now we have to go to the grave</v>

225
00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:07.370
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I ask you today</v>

226
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.270
<v Speaker 3>how many goals they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>around your bed.</v>

227
00:14:11.271 --> 00:14:14.630
<v Speaker 3>When your time comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go west,</v>

228
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.790
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've invested a lot in your education</v>

229
00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:20.330
<v Speaker 3>and people had invested in you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let me tell you the world needs your</v>

230
00:14:20.331 --> 00:14:24.530
<v Speaker 3>talents and does it ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got back from Africa like two</v>

231
00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.750
<v Speaker 3>days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I'm rambling on it's cause I'm jet</v>

232
00:14:26.751 --> 00:14:28.940
<v Speaker 3>lag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got back from South Africa.</v>

233
00:14:28.941 --> 00:14:32.210
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are places there with terrible</v>

234
00:14:32.211 --> 00:14:35.480
<v Speaker 3>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poverty that need help in Africa is just</v>

235
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.570
<v Speaker 3>the tip of the iceberg.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We need it from you young people.</v>

242
00:15:00.721 --> 00:15:02.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not speaking for the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 3>us up here,</v>

243
00:15:02.641 --> 00:15:06.480
<v Speaker 3>but I know I'm getting a little grayer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We needed from you.</v>

244
00:15:06.481 --> 00:15:10.080
<v Speaker 3>The young people cause remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got to get out there.</v>

245
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.270
<v Speaker 3>You got to give it everything you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>got.</v>

246
00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:14.850
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's your time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

247
00:15:14.851 --> 00:15:16.320
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your talent,</v>

248
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:21.180
<v Speaker 3>your prayers or your treasures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because remember this,</v>

249
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.010
<v Speaker 3>you will never see a u haul behind a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hearse.</v>

250
00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.573
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

251
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will never see a u haul behind a</v>

252
00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 3>hearse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't take it with you.</v>

253
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.790
<v Speaker 3>The Egyptians tried it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all they got was robbed.</v>

254
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.130
<v Speaker 3>So the question is what are you going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do with what you have?</v>

255
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:59.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about how much you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of you are business majors.</v>

256
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:01.070
<v Speaker 3>Some of you are theologians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nurses,</v>

257
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:03.110
<v Speaker 3>sociologists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of you have money,</v>

258
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.140
<v Speaker 3>some of you have patience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of you have kindness,</v>

259
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.650
<v Speaker 3>some of you have loved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of you have the gift of long</v>

260
00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:11.030
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is,</v>

261
00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:15.680
<v Speaker 3>whatever your gift is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to do with what you</v>

262
00:16:15.681 --> 00:16:17.960
<v Speaker 3>have</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now?</v>

263
00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:22.961
<v Speaker 3>Here's my last point about failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's the best way to figure</v>

264
00:16:24.591 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 3>out where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your life will never be a straight path.</v>

265
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I began at Fordham University as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>premed student.</v>

266
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:37.460
<v Speaker 3>I took a course called the CARC cardiac</v>
<v Speaker 3>morphous.</v>

267
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.460
<v Speaker 3>I still can't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called cardiac,</v>

268
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.860
<v Speaker 3>cardiac morphogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't read it.</v>

269
00:16:42.861 --> 00:16:44.840
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sure couldn't pass it.</v>

270
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.840
<v Speaker 3>So then I decided to go into pre law</v>
<v Speaker 3>then journalism and with no academic</v>

271
00:16:52.841 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 3>focus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my grades took off in their own</v>

272
00:16:54.851 --> 00:16:55.684
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

273
00:16:58.890 --> 00:16:59.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

274
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:05.370
<v Speaker 3>I was a 1.8 gpa one semester and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>university very politely suggested that</v>

275
00:17:07.441 --> 00:17:09.540
<v Speaker 3>it might be better to take some time</v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

276
00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.210
<v Speaker 3>I was 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at my lowest point and then one</v>

277
00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:17.130
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I remember the exact day,</v>

278
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.330
<v Speaker 3>March 27th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1975 I was helping my mother and her</v>

279
00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:23.820
<v Speaker 3>beauty shop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother owned a beauty shop up in Mt.</v>

280
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.550
<v Speaker 3>Vernon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there was this older woman who</v>

281
00:17:26.551 --> 00:17:30.630
<v Speaker 3>was considered one of the elders and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>town and I didn't know her personally,</v>

282
00:17:30.631 --> 00:17:33.450
<v Speaker 3>but I was looking in the mirror and</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I looked in the mirror I</v>

283
00:17:33.451 --> 00:17:35.760
<v Speaker 3>could see her behind me and she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>staring at me.</v>

284
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.000
<v Speaker 3>She just kept looking at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time I looked at it,</v>

285
00:17:39.001 --> 00:17:43.100
<v Speaker 3>she kept giving me these strange looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she finally took the dry off ahead</v>

286
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.660
<v Speaker 3>and sets to some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said something I'll never forget.</v>

287
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:47.311
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

288
00:17:47.311 --> 00:17:48.900
<v Speaker 3>somebody give me a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me a piece of,</v>

289
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.210
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young boy,</v>

290
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I have a prophecy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a spiritual prophecy.</v>

291
00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.380
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are going to travel the world and</v>

292
00:18:00.381 --> 00:18:03.110
<v Speaker 3>speak to millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Mind You,</v>

293
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm flunked out of school.</v>

294
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.970
<v Speaker 3>In fact like a wise ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking to myself,</v>

295
00:18:07.971 --> 00:18:10.730
<v Speaker 3>maybe she's got something in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>crystal ball about me getting back into</v>

296
00:18:10.731 --> 00:18:11.570
<v Speaker 3>school next fall.</v>

297
00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.350
<v Speaker 3>But maybe she was onto something because</v>
<v Speaker 3>later that summer,</v>

298
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.320
<v Speaker 3>while working as a counselor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ymc camp and Connecticut,</v>

299
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.530
<v Speaker 3>we put on a talent show for the campers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and after the show,</v>

300
00:18:23.531 --> 00:18:25.480
<v Speaker 3>another council that came up to me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ask,</v>

301
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.790
<v Speaker 3>had you ever thought about acting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're good at that.</v>

302
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.260
<v Speaker 3>So when I got back to Fordham that fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got in and I changed my major once</v>

303
00:18:32.261 --> 00:18:37.261
<v Speaker 3>again for the last time and then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>years that followed just as that woman</v>

304
00:18:37.391 --> 00:18:40.270
<v Speaker 3>prophesies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have traveled the world and I have</v>

305
00:18:40.271 --> 00:18:42.910
<v Speaker 3>spoken to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tons of people through my movies,</v>

306
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.140
<v Speaker 3>millions who up until this day couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>see me.</v>

307
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.460
<v Speaker 3>I owe who were up till this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't see while I was talking to</v>

308
00:18:51.461 --> 00:18:53.620
<v Speaker 3>them and they couldn't see me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could only see the movie.</v>

309
00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:59.730
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't see the real me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I see you today</v>

310
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.800
<v Speaker 3>and I'm encouraged by what I see</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm strengthened by what I see</v>

311
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.280
<v Speaker 3>and I love what I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One more page and I'll shut up.</v>

312
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Let me conclude with this one final</v>
<v Speaker 3>point and actually the president kind of</v>

313
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 3>brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with the movie</v>

314
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:36.660
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She stole my material</v>

315
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.980
<v Speaker 3>many years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this movie called Philadelphia.</v>

316
00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.460
<v Speaker 3>We filmed some of the scenes right here</v>
<v Speaker 3>on campus.</v>

317
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.350
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia came out in 1993 most of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are probably still in diapers.</v>

318
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.420
<v Speaker 3>Some of the professors too.</v>

319
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.460
<v Speaker 2>That cracked me up,</v>

320
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.890
<v Speaker 3>but it was a good movie you rented on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nick.</v>

321
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:01.781
<v Speaker 3>Nick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you call it?</v>

322
00:20:01.781 --> 00:20:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good movie.</v>

323
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Renton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get 23 cents every time you run it,</v>

324
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.950
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True</v>

325
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.333
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rent,</v>

326
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.273
<v Speaker 3>rent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rent it.</v>

327
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.263
<v Speaker 2>Netflix.</v>

328
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.560
<v Speaker 3>Tell your friends too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about a man played by Tom Hanks</v>

329
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.230
<v Speaker 3>who's fired from his law for him because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has aids.</v>

330
00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.380
<v Speaker 3>He wants to sue the firm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one's willing to represent him</v>

331
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:26.480
<v Speaker 3>until the homophobic ambulance chaser</v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyer played by yours truly takes on</v>

332
00:20:26.481 --> 00:20:27.950
<v Speaker 3>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a way.</v>

333
00:20:27.951 --> 00:20:31.160
<v Speaker 3>If you watch the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see everything I'm talking about</v>

334
00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:33.860
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll see what I mean about taking</v>

335
00:20:33.861 --> 00:20:38.861
<v Speaker 3>risks or being willing to fail because</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking risk is not just about going for</v>

336
00:20:39.561 --> 00:20:42.860
<v Speaker 3>a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also about knowing what you know</v>

337
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 3>and what you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about being open to people and two</v>

338
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:51.670
<v Speaker 3>ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the course of the film,</v>

339
00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:55.270
<v Speaker 3>the character I play begins to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>small steps,</v>

340
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 3>small risks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very,</v>

341
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very slowly begins to overcome his fears</v>

342
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.190
<v Speaker 3>and I feel ultimately his heart becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>flooded with love</v>

343
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:16.250
<v Speaker 3>and I can't think of a better message as</v>
<v Speaker 3>we send you off today to not only take</v>

344
00:21:16.321 --> 00:21:19.590
<v Speaker 3>risks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to be open to life,</v>

345
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.700
<v Speaker 3>to accept new views,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to be open to new opinions,</v>

346
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:28.290
<v Speaker 3>to be willing to speak at a commencement</v>
<v Speaker 3>had one of the best country Becka,</v>

347
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.320
<v Speaker 3>the universities in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though you're scared stiff.</v>

348
00:21:31.321 --> 00:21:36.150
<v Speaker 3>While it may be frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will also be rewarding because the</v>

349
00:21:36.151 --> 00:21:40.920
<v Speaker 3>chances you take the people you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people you love,</v>

350
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.270
<v Speaker 3>the faith that you have,</v>
