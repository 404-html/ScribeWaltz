1
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>So here's a little issue we have in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America today,</v>

2
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>there are currently about 250,000 people</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year who are dying in our hospitals</v>

3
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>due to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>due to preventable deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about negligence,</v>

5
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about little accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the doctor in the</v>

7
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not properly briefing the doctor for the</v>

8
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>evening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

9
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>we can't sue anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing,</v>

11
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that we can see that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.480
<v Speaker 1>but there's 250,000 preventable deaths</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>That's about 27,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 sevens going down every single week.</v>

14
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what's the equivalent to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the confusing thing is that we have</v>

15
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:02.331
<v Speaker 1>the best doctors in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the most advanced technology in</v>

16
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the medical equipment we have as</v>

17
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>the best in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medicines we have are the best in</v>

18
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you start asking yourselves why are</v>

19
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>these things happening?</v>

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is not because of any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

21
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>the reasons are actually something</v>
<v Speaker 1>vastly more simple.</v>

22
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>It's something very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very human.</v>

23
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Five percent of hospital administrators</v>
<v Speaker 1>or doctors,</v>

24
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>most of them are number crunchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hospitals are run like businesses.</v>

25
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Hospitals are run by the numbers and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem isn't the people who are giving</v>

26
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>the care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very highly trained.</v>

27
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the way those people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>cared for because what we've done is</v>

28
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>we've created cultures in hospitals</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the people who were doing the</v>

29
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>caring aren't cared for and so all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these little preventable deaths are</v>

30
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>happening because they don't feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a part of anything.</v>

31
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>They're just doing their jobs and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get along that well,</v>

32
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and there's not a lot of comradery and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impact is death.</v>

33
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use this example because it's</v>

34
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated because the impact is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

35
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is the same in our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

36
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Which is we come to work and were told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must care for your clients.</v>

38
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>You must care for your customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must make them the focus of all you</v>

39
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet why aren't the people who are</v>

40
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>managing us from the top caring about</v>
<v Speaker 1>us?</v>

41
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a hospital,</v>

42
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>the impact is worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the impact that we're having on the</v>

43
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>outside world is just as bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

44
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.250
<v Speaker 1>we're not working at our best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't care for the things we're</v>

45
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not helping each other is the most</v>

46
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>important part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the residual impact is that we are</v>

47
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>unfulfilled by the work that we do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when were unfulfilled by the work that</v>

48
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we focus on the details and when we</v>

49
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>focus on the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we retract from each other.</v>

50
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>When we tracked from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel lonely.</v>

51
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>And when we feel lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer goes up,</v>

52
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>heart disease goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes goes up.</v>

53
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by going to work,</v>

54
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>we're killing ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>

55
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>There's another study that was released</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that long ago that says that,</v>

56
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents who work late,</v>

57
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>the negative impact that it has on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>children is little to none.</v>

58
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>They may feel guilty as parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the negative impact that it has on</v>

59
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>the raising of their children is little</v>
<v Speaker 1>to none.</v>

60
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents who come home from jobs they</v>

61
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>hate or don't love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their kids are more likely to be bullied</v>

62
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you think about the bullying</v>

63
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>epidemic we have in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Where there's this disturbing number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>young children who are killing</v>

65
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicides because of bullies.</v>

66
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>The problem is not the schools and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem isn't even the parenting.</v>

67
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the jobs the parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

68
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>This is the importance and this is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>power of the work that we do and the</v>

69
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>places we go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

71
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.470
<v Speaker 1>like if you listen to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

72
00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>the unemployment statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

74
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all time high,</v>

75
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>record high nine to 10 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment,</v>

76
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:55.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people go,</v>

77
00:03:55.971 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terrible.</v>

78
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.480
<v Speaker 1>And I hear that number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

79
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means 91 percent still have a job</v>

80
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>

81
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>we want to get that employment number</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

82
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>but that means 91 percent is still going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>

83
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>The question is how many of them coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>home fulfilled by the work that they do</v>

84
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>and how many of them are waking up</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired to go back to work the next</v>

85
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't love our works,</v>

86
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>we don't look out for each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we don't look out for each other,</v>

87
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>we feel lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't feel lonely,</v>

88
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:23.401
<v Speaker 1>all these negative things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what example can I share with a</v>

89
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>creative audience about how to change</v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

90
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>The United States Marine Corps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the great honor last week of</v>

91
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>spending a week with the marines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent a couple days at Camp Lajune and</v>

92
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>then I went for a few days to Parris</v>
<v Speaker 1>Island to watch them go through bootcamp</v>

93
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't a remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable human experiment that they're</v>

94
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>doing and even though they know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

95
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>they don't know why it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't need to know why,</v>

96
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>because they know that it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

97
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 1>But what's happening is they're taking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of strangers,</v>

98
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>people who don't know each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are showing up and within a very,</v>

99
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>very short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to trust each other.</v>

100
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>So much that they would give their lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>for each other,</v>

101
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know everyone,</v>

102
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>sort of anyone who's ever worn a uniform</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows that no one runs into battle for</v>

103
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>God and country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen.</v>

104
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>It's for the guy to the left of me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy to the right of me.</v>

105
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason they do what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

106
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 1>And these sort of remarkable stories of</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroism where people rush into very,</v>

107
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous situations to save others</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they always ask the question,</v>

108
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>why did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you risk your life?</v>

109
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Why would you put yourself at risk for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

110
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>And the answer's always the same because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would do it for me.</v>

111
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what gives them the confidence to put</v>

112
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>themselves at great risk is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that someone would do the same</v>

113
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would put ourselves at great risk for</v>

114
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>our companies if we knew that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies would put themselves at great</v>

115
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>risk for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

116
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 1>So we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

117
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the marines and if you go read and</v>

118
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>you know this is the most I asked these</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're 21,</v>

119
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>22 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these,</v>

120
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>these lance corporals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grunts,</v>

121
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys,</v>

122
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>the infantry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the lowest of the low,</v>

123
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 1>the ones we actually send into battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>the front lines and I asked them,</v>

124
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>are you misunderstood in America?</v>

125
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 1>And they said yes unanimously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all not it.</v>

126
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:11.890
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

127
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>What do people think of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one stood up and says,</v>

128
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 1>they think we're baby killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

129
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>how does it feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

130
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 1>it hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I say,</v>

131
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me a story then that captures to</v>

132
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>you what it means to be a marine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feeling you have of being a marine.</v>

133
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a story that captures it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>expected to hear stories of I took a hit</v>

134
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>and somebody save me or I ran into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>firefight and pulled some it.</v>

135
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>I expected these stories of heroism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a single story like that came out.</v>

136
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm sure there's stories exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those aren't the stories they told</v>

137
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 1>me that capture what it means to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>marine.</v>

138
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>One of the stories they told me was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>young boy in Afghanistan who would come</v>

139
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>around every morning and sell kabobs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marines and then one day he showed</v>

140
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>up and he was all beaten up and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't go to his parents for help and he</v>

141
00:06:57.051 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>didn't go to his friends to help.</v>

142
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>He came to the marines for help because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he trusted them more than anyone else.</v>

143
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 1>They told me a story that captured how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel of a civilian bridge that had</v>

144
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>been overrun by the Taliban and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>residents of the village could,</v>

145
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>couldn't go home because they would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed by the Taliban.</v>

146
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 1>And so they were just living by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>river.</v>

147
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>The problem was winter was coming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

148
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elders came to the marines,</v>

149
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 1>knocked on the door and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you to come down to the river and</v>

150
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the marines had,</v>

151
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

152
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>if we go back home will be killed by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taliban.</v>

153
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And if we stay out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to die slow deaths this</v>

154
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier if you just come and kill</v>

155
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:38.234
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

156
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>The marines overran the Taliban village,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push the Taliban out.</v>

157
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 1>A year later they went back to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>village and people were playing</v>

158
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>volleyball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were the stories they told me that</v>

159
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:53.321
<v Speaker 1>capture what it means to be a marine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe in doing good for others</v>

160
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.720
<v Speaker 1>and the fulfillment they get when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>put themselves at risk so that others</v>

161
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 1>may prevail is overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not unique to the Marine Corps.</v>

162
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 1>This is all human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feeling of fulfillment comes from</v>

163
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>doing something for another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feeling from fulfillment comes from</v>

164
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>the exertion of time and energy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else.</v>

165
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.780
<v Speaker 1>If you are walking to work and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw,</v>

166
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>throw a few pennies in a cup and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to work and you say to your</v>

167
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

168
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I gave a dollar to somebody homeless</v>
<v Speaker 1>this morning.</v>

169
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>What are your friends going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good,</v>

170
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave 20 bucks to somebody homeless.</v>

171
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like a good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.000
<v Speaker 1>What have you come in in the morning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

173
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave up my Saturday night.</v>

174
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I went and painted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>painted a school in the inner city.</v>

175
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.700
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

176
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

177
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden,</v>

178
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.940
<v Speaker 1>not only are they inspired to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something good themselves,</v>

179
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 1>but the feeling that that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>persists.</v>

180
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 1>The amazing thing is that when we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for others that actually inspires</v>

181
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 1>others to do good for others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has provided for us prime</v>

182
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 1>logically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anthropologically it's all part of the</v>

183
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 1>survival of the species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

184
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:06.270
<v Speaker 1>sex feels good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that will do it so we can procreate</v>

185
00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:09.660
<v Speaker 1>and perpetuate the species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're social animals and so we have</v>

186
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 1>to provide for the fact that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain strong bonds and build cultures</v>

187
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what humans do.</v>

188
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 1>We're cultural animals and so when we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for others and we look out for</v>

189
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 1>those in our tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look out for those in our group.</v>

190
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 1>It actually feels good biologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>releases oxytocin.</v>

191
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>This chemical that's released when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do good for others is released and it</v>

192
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>makes you feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the amazing thing is the more</v>

193
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>oxytocin you have in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you want to do good for others.</v>

194
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>The problem is we've replaced this</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling,</v>

195
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:38.760
<v Speaker 1>the exertion of time and energy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital communications.</v>

196
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>We've replaced it with headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've replaced it with money,</v>

197
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the invention of money,</v>

198
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be money used to be like you</v>

199
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>go to someone's house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cook them dinner,</v>

200
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 1>and the deal was they'll do the dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and energy exchange for time and</v>

201
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone said,</v>

202
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an Iou,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

203
00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like doing the dishes,</v>

204
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to give you an iou that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>promise to do them another day.</v>

205
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what money is.</v>

206
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>It is the promise for future goods or</v>
<v Speaker 1>services,</v>

207
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>the promise of future goods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

208
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've replaced our own time and energy</v>

209
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 1>with promises for someone else to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>another day,</v>

210
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

211
00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:22.530
<v Speaker 1>there's no exertion of time and energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the feeling people get is that I</v>

212
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:24.930
<v Speaker 1>did something for you and you did</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing for me.</v>

213
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 1>You replaced it with a piece of paper</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an Iru,</v>

214
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 1>with a promise for future goods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

215
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.330
<v Speaker 1>The way we find fulfillment is by doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for others,</v>

216
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 1>so how did the marines it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you get people to do good for</v>

217
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:37.740
<v Speaker 1>others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know this intellectually.</v>

218
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 1>We know that it's good to do good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

219
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 1>but why don't we do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then why don't we do it and what the</v>

220
00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Marines learned is something that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely did not expect.</v>

221
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.280
<v Speaker 1>They can't just yell at these guys to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help each other.</v>

222
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 1>That's not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few things that they have to</v>

223
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:58.050
<v Speaker 1>do first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we all heard of the obstacle course,</v>

224
00:10:58.051 --> 00:10:59.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The marines have a thing called the</v>

225
00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 1>obstacle course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where they build anaerobic</v>

226
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:03.810
<v Speaker 1>strength and aerobic strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle strength,</v>

227
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 1>and it's timed and all of this good</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

228
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.910
<v Speaker 1>They have another course called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence course and it's never timed</v>

229
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.420
<v Speaker 1>and most of the obstacles on this course</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot be completed by yourself.</v>

230
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.040
<v Speaker 1>They must be completed in teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no choice.</v>

231
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.940
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it's designed and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say is the first two weeks of</v>

232
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>bootcamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's there to outdo each other</v>

233
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:29.490
<v Speaker 1>and prove that they're strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kind of like when we start in a job</v>

234
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>where proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to show how great we are,</v>

235
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:32.010
<v Speaker 1>we'll work a little harder.</v>

236
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.710
<v Speaker 1>We'll do good work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how good my designers,</v>

237
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about us and how good we are.</v>

238
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they keep putting them in situations</v>

239
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:42.000
<v Speaker 1>where they can't do things by themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what starts to happen very slowly.</v>

240
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 1>They said after about two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start cheering for each other.</v>

241
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Now they get in trouble when they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they start cheering for each other</v>

242
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.170
<v Speaker 1>and then before too long you see them</v>
<v Speaker 1>organically start helping each other.</v>

243
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.030
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is if there's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's weak and refuses to help</v>

244
00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the others,</v>

245
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 1>or even if there's one person who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

246
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.511
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't star college athlete and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to every the end of every obstacle,</v>

248
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 1>they just stand there and wait for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody to finish and they don't help</v>

249
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What starts to happen as organically,</v>

250
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:12.190
<v Speaker 1>the group starts to ostracize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person organically.</v>

251
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 1>They get ostracized until they learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only way that they will get</v>

252
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:18.490
<v Speaker 1>through this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they only way they will survive bootcamp</v>

253
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 1>is if they ask for help because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have no option.</v>

254
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 1>The problem is no one will help them</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they're willing to help another.</v>

255
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.150
<v Speaker 1>It's the deal we have to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called vulnerability and risk.</v>

256
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 1>We have to take the risk to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves vulnerable.</v>

257
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might do something for someone else</v>

258
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 1>and they may not do something back for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

259
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the risk you run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the risk you run.</v>

260
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about giving everything to them</v>

261
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 1>and sort of huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

262
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about little things and little</v>

263
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like going on a date,</v>

264
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because like if I went on a date with</v>

265
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:48.610
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came home and I said,</v>

266
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:50.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after one date I said,</v>

267
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.353
<v Speaker 1>I'm marrying her.</v>

268
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.160
<v Speaker 1>They be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

269
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Are you nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

270
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

271
00:12:58.530 --> 00:12:59.890
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

272
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm in love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She feels the same way.</v>

273
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.780
<v Speaker 1>We both know it's nuts right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you're going to be like,</v>

274
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 1>go on a couple more dates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

275
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.560
<v Speaker 1>We know instinctively that the strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>bond that's created that,</v>

276
00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be created first takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a week.</v>

277
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that.</v>

278
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I've been dating somebody for</v>

279
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:25.230
<v Speaker 1>seven years and we haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.171
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

281
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong?</v>

282
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

283
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:31.930
<v Speaker 1>we know that it takes more than seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>days and we know that it takes less than</v>

284
00:13:31.931 --> 00:13:36.670
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is we don't know how long it</v>

285
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:39.640
<v Speaker 1>takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere in the middle,</v>

286
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.660
<v Speaker 1>all human bonds are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you show up at work,</v>

287
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 1>when you show up for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're new,</v>

288
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.760
<v Speaker 1>don't expect that people will look out</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you and they won't expect you to</v>

289
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:50.740
<v Speaker 1>look out for them in seven days it won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

290
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.530
<v Speaker 1>but if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working at a job for a few years and you</v>

291
00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:56.710
<v Speaker 1>don't have the n,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d sort of the the absolute confidence</v>

292
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.450
<v Speaker 1>that if you turn your back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will not get stabbed.</v>

293
00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 1>You can rely on somebody who can give</v>
<v Speaker 1>them something.</v>

294
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Nothing will go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will share the credit.</v>

295
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:04.420
<v Speaker 1>No one will throw you under the bus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that in a few years.</v>

296
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's wrong.</v>

297
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that's more than a week and I</v>

298
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:14.701
<v Speaker 1>know it's less than seven years and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>marines fundamentally understand that</v>

299
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:18.760
<v Speaker 1>before anyone is willing to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves out for another,</v>

300
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.930
<v Speaker 1>they have to have self confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real self confidence.</v>

301
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 1>You have to be confident in yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own ability before you're willing</v>

302
00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 1>to help another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're insecure at all about your own</v>

303
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:30.720
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an oxy.</v>

304
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

305
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.450
<v Speaker 1>How am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can I overcome my confidence?</v>

306
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my self confidence and we all have ego</v>

307
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:37.300
<v Speaker 1>issues at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

308
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:38.500
<v Speaker 1>we all do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

309
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.860
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm not confident in myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't help another.</v>

310
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:46.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a paradox because then we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone to look out for us before we're</v>

311
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:47.680
<v Speaker 1>willing to help our peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

312
00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.630
<v Speaker 1>This is what management is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

313
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>The drill instructors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the school they are.</v>

314
00:14:52.281 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 1>There are parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are there for one reason and one</v>

315
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 1>reason only to help us feel strong and</v>
<v Speaker 1>good about ourselves,</v>

316
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.930
<v Speaker 1>but look at the way we talk to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

317
00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

318
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.680
<v Speaker 1>a budget's been cut and so what do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get told?</v>

319
00:15:03.681 --> 00:15:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I need you guys to do more with less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

320
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:07.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>

321
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I need you guys to do more with less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what told by our clients,</v>

322
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 1>by our bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by our parents.</v>

323
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 1>This is what we're told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

324
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 1>That's like your parents telling you</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're young.</v>

325
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I know you're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure it out,</v>

326
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not as smart as the other kids.</v>

327
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 1>What do you want me to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

328
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.580
<v Speaker 1>It's the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you to do more with less,</v>

329
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we need to be telling people is I</v>

330
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:33.830
<v Speaker 1>need you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to do to do more with what you</v>

331
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

332
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 1>You have capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have strength,</v>

333
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 1>you have talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have compatibility.</v>

334
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I need you to do more with what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

335
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:47.300
<v Speaker 1>We don't celebrate what we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We criticized or what we don't have.</v>

336
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.710
<v Speaker 1>This is the responsibility of management</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take us under their wing and help us</v>

337
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:56.711
<v Speaker 1>understand our own value to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close your eyes and think back to high</v>

338
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:03.461
<v Speaker 1>school and think of that one teacher who</v>
<v Speaker 1>took you under their wing and cared for</v>

339
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:08.450
<v Speaker 1>you and looked after you and helped you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that you are capable of more</v>

340
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:13.250
<v Speaker 1>than you thought you were and you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably are the person you are</v>

341
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:15.830
<v Speaker 1>today in some part because of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

342
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have that name?</v>

343
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.370
<v Speaker 1>What's the name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me the name.</v>

344
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Tell me the name of the teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

345
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Give me the name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can.</v>

346
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I can point to anybody and you can tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>me that name now,</v>

347
00:16:30.091 --> 00:16:32.180
<v Speaker 1>tell me the names of all the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers you had that day.</v>

348
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Can't remember them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenya.</v>

349
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.380
<v Speaker 1>This is the power of those who teach us</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>

350
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.980
<v Speaker 1>We will literally carry their names</v>
<v Speaker 1>around with us for the rest of our</v>

351
00:16:40.981 --> 00:16:44.520
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you want to be that person?</v>

352
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you want to be the person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years from now,</v>

353
00:16:47.221 --> 00:16:48.720
<v Speaker 1>30 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years from now,</v>

354
00:16:48.721 --> 00:16:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I can do this exercise with somebody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will tell me your name.</v>

355
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.610
<v Speaker 1>This is the power of helping others</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize their own strengths.</v>

356
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.610
<v Speaker 1>This is what management and leadership</v>
<v Speaker 1>is supposed to be doing.</v>

357
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.500
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to be caring for us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping us realize our own value,</v>

358
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.120
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have anybody who reports to your</v>

359
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.020
<v Speaker 1>works for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your responsibility is not to make them</v>

360
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 1>meet the deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're responsibility is not to make</v>

361
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:18.530
<v Speaker 1>sure that they do is you say your</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility is to make sure that they</v>

362
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:21.350
<v Speaker 1>understand their own strengths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own value,</v>

363
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 1>and that they are way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more talented than they think they</v>

364
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:27.940
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way they will learn that is</v>

365
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:32.130
<v Speaker 1>if you put them in situations in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can fail and you hold them and you</v>

366
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 1>support them and you give them talent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you give them skills and you give</v>

367
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 1>them education and you watch their backs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they fall over,</v>

368
00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you encourage them to get back up.</v>

369
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>And if they follow the carriage them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get back up.</v>

370
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 1>And if they fall over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you encourage them to get back up until</v>

371
00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 1>they figure it out themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called confidence.</v>

372
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.200
<v Speaker 1>It's your responsibility to help others</v>
<v Speaker 1>find it into others responsibility to</v>

373
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 1>help you find yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the amazing thing is as soon as you</v>

374
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:53.400
<v Speaker 1>start feeling confident in your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>

375
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.260
<v Speaker 1>you're naturally help each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

376
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:03.510
<v Speaker 1>It's called trust in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give medals to people who were</v>

377
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:06.660
<v Speaker 1>willing to sacrifice themselves so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>others may gain</v>

378
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.980
<v Speaker 1>in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are willing to give bonuses to people</v>

379
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:13.020
<v Speaker 1>who will sacrifice others so that we may</v>
<v Speaker 1>gain.</v>

380
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 1>We have it backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we complain about how we don't</v>

381
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:21.780
<v Speaker 1>love our jobs and we complain about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work is suffering and we complain</v>

382
00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:24.000
<v Speaker 1>about how budgets are being cut and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can complain,</v>

383
00:18:24.001 --> 00:18:24.834
<v Speaker 1>complain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complain,</v>

384
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.950
<v Speaker 1>and the first thing we do is blame each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and become more selfish and</v>

385
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:31.020
<v Speaker 1>worried about my pay and my benefits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my this.</v>

386
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 1>And this is what happens when we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfulfilled.</v>

387
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.580
<v Speaker 1>We look at the metrics and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not good enough.</v>

388
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.740
<v Speaker 1>When we are fulfilled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't care about the metrics.</v>

389
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.230
<v Speaker 1>This is why when you have a job you love</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get a call that says,</v>

390
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I'll offer you tons more money and great</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits you like,</v>

391
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested.</v>

392
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy here,</v>

393
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.250
<v Speaker 1>but we'll give you more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the reason I'm here.</v>

394
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm here because I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here because I care for the people I</v>

395
00:18:54.121 --> 00:18:58.800
<v Speaker 1>work with and I'm here because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people I work with care for me.</v>

396
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.230
<v Speaker 1>This is the world I imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the world I imagine.</v>

397
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 1>And here's the great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take little risks,</v>

398
00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about big things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little things.</v>

399
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Did you start doing little things for</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other?</v>

400
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:18.140
<v Speaker 1>The amazing anthropological response is</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people will start doing little</v>

401
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:22.500
<v Speaker 1>things for others too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was walking down the street two days</v>

402
00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:26.510
<v Speaker 1>ago and a guys backpack was open and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of paper fell out as is</v>

403
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 1>walking down the street and I happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be behind him and so my friend and I</v>

404
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:32.340
<v Speaker 1>just sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We written mid conversation and in mid</v>

405
00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 1>conversation we never even stopped</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>

406
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.790
<v Speaker 1>We just bend down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of help them gather those papers.</v>

407
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.880
<v Speaker 1>I and them back to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of pointed out that his book bag</v>

408
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:39.360
<v Speaker 1>was his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.100
<v Speaker 1>his backpack was unzipped and he said</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks,</v>

410
00:19:41.101 --> 00:19:42.810
<v Speaker 1>and we walked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like no big deal,</v>

411
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get to the end of the street,</v>

412
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 1>we stand at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're waiting to cross the street.</v>

413
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.630
<v Speaker 1>We still talk and we haven't stopped</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking and the guy in front of us turns</v>

414
00:19:51.631 --> 00:19:54.510
<v Speaker 1>to us and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you help that guy.</v>

415
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.250
<v Speaker 1>That was really cool,</v>

416
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.850
<v Speaker 1>but here's what's great about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy will go do something for someone</v>

417
00:20:03.851 --> 00:20:07.420
<v Speaker 1>else simply because he saw us bend down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pick up paper for someone else.</v>

418
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.480
<v Speaker 1>He will actually go do something for</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else because of it,</v>

419
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

420
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.400
<v Speaker 1>he won't give to charity because he sees</v>
<v Speaker 1>me put a dollar in a cup,</v>

421
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:20.160
<v Speaker 1>but he will actually help someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he saw someone also helps</v>

422
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.720
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little things hold the door open for</v>

423
00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:24.370
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say thank you to the person who holds</v>

424
00:20:24.371 --> 00:20:26.380
<v Speaker 1>the door open for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smile to the Barista.</v>

425
00:20:26.381 --> 00:20:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Little little things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put your foot in the subway when the</v>

426
00:20:30.791 --> 00:20:32.470
<v Speaker 1>doors closing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so someone who's running,</v>

427
00:20:32.471 --> 00:20:34.780
<v Speaker 1>we'll make it hit the open at the at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator.</v>

428
00:20:34.781 --> 00:20:39.781
<v Speaker 1>Don't go</v>
<v Speaker 1>or pretend you didn't.</v>

429
00:20:41.171 --> 00:20:42.280
<v Speaker 1>See that's the best one.</v>

430
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

431
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't if I saw sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

432
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Do it a little time and a little energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll find around work that people</v>

433
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Speaker 1>give a little time and a little energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to you and you'll give a little</v>

434
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 1>more time and a little more energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go for a coffee with someone.</v>

435
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Then you go for two hour coffee and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for a coffee and a lunch,</v>

436
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.060
<v Speaker 1>then you go for lunch and a dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you go for a dinner and a movie and</v>

437
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:12.370
<v Speaker 1>then you sleep over and then you sleep</v>
<v Speaker 1>over two nights and then you go on</v>

438
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:14.200
<v Speaker 1>holiday together and eventually you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>

439
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's slow.</v>

440
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.000
<v Speaker 1>It takes time and we can't rush it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

441
00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:19.721
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we rush it,</v>

442
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:23.230
<v Speaker 1>it's all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do things for others and watch.</v>

443
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Watch how much others do for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

444
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.250
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go get yourself a cup of coffee from</v>

445
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:29.890
<v Speaker 1>the coffee sheet machine in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make one for someone else.</v>

446
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.710
<v Speaker 1>It takes a little extra time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a little extra energy.</v>

447
00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>

448
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:40.230
<v Speaker 1>And here's the best part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will feel so good at the end of the</v>

449
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.240
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

450
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.083
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

451
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

452
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you convince someone?</v>

453
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.380
<v Speaker 1>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are the metrics?</v>

454
00:22:01.381 --> 00:22:03.810
<v Speaker 1>How do you convince a skeptical audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this trust metric?</v>

455
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

456
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.740
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

457
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.300
<v Speaker 1>You can't twist anybody's arm to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that they don't want to do and</v>

458
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law of diffusion,</v>

459
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.470
<v Speaker 1>which I obey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.030
<v Speaker 1>as hard as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as I can,</v>

461
00:22:18.031 --> 00:22:21.900
<v Speaker 1>which is you don't need the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need those people who believe what</v>

462
00:22:21.901 --> 00:22:22.711
<v Speaker 1>you believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

463
00:22:22.711 --> 00:22:23.710
<v Speaker 1>if you bought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

464
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go sort of,</v>

465
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.690
<v Speaker 1>when you do some nice things for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may not do something nice back</v>

466
00:22:27.691 --> 00:22:28.860
<v Speaker 1>because they may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

467
00:22:28.861 --> 00:22:30.690
<v Speaker 1>we live in a world in which you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something for somebody.</v>

468
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.840
<v Speaker 1>They think you want something from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

469
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.090
<v Speaker 1>That's unfortunately the society we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>

470
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.090
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the risk that we keep taking.</v>

471
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying you should keep doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for somebody who keeps doing nothing</v>

472
00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:43.850
<v Speaker 1>and keeps sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

473
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.890
<v Speaker 1>crapping on you because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then at some point you have to be like,</v>

474
00:22:46.891 --> 00:22:48.360
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bad,</v>

475
00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:49.501
<v Speaker 1>my bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

476
00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:50.560
<v Speaker 1>And you back off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

477
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in helping everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe in it.</v>

478
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

479
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:56.250
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

480
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.020
<v Speaker 1>let's do good for everyone on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

481
00:22:58.021 --> 00:22:59.840
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother Theresa,</v>

482
00:22:59.841 --> 00:23:03.720
<v Speaker 1>who was the poster child for giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>selflessly to all who need at the end of</v>

483
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.070
<v Speaker 1>her life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started questioning the existence of God</v>

484
00:23:05.071 --> 00:23:07.950
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hated her life serious.</v>

485
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

486
00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:14.541
<v Speaker 1>giving to others unabashedly is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>self destructive.</v>

487
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

488
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's just like going on dates with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you don't like,</v>

489
00:23:20.611 --> 00:23:23.300
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you'll eventually click and</v>
<v Speaker 1>map.</v>

490
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.103
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

491
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.330
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only one machine that I found</v>

492
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.110
<v Speaker 1>that really accurately measures trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than any other sort of metric.</v>

493
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.230
<v Speaker 1>It's called the human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good at it.</v>

494
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those feelings you get,</v>

495
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.890
<v Speaker 1>trust them in one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

496
00:23:43.891 --> 00:23:45.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the little risks.</v>

497
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the butterflies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the unsure,</v>

498
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

499
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 1>it's the backwards and it's the dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dating,</v>

500
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.580
<v Speaker 1>it's the dance at the nerves like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

501
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.700
<v Speaker 1>it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there were,</v>

502
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.670
<v Speaker 1>if there are cynical bastards at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>office who,</v>

503
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:58.760
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

504
00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.840
<v Speaker 1>don't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignore,</v>

505
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.940
<v Speaker 1>ignore him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it because eventually</v>

506
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:05.270
<v Speaker 1>you'll get enough and those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>either come along or leave or be pushed</v>

507
00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:06.680
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

508
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.060
<v Speaker 1>ostracized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

509
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.650
<v Speaker 1>when the group starts helping each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

510
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.780
<v Speaker 1>they ostracize the ones who refuse to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>

511
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:13.130
<v Speaker 1>whether they're strong or whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're weak,</v>

512
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.950
<v Speaker 1>they get ostracized until they learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they learn that they cannot</v>

513
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 1>survive without the help of others.</v>

514
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 1>And they learn that the only way others</v>
<v Speaker 1>will help them as if they,</v>

515
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 1>if they help the others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

516
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.460
<v Speaker 1>The order matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The order matters.</v>

517
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Just I just thought of something that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pervasive in our sort of,</v>

518
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital world,</v>

519
00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:35.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the order matters,</v>

520
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.240
<v Speaker 1>so to speak honestly about what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

521
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are doing,</v>

522
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.140
<v Speaker 1>don't do things for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you want something from them,</v>

523
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.990
<v Speaker 1>just ask them what you want from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you one little example.</v>

524
00:24:44.991 --> 00:24:48.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny little example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all received emails that go like</v>

525
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear Simon,</v>

526
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.470
<v Speaker 1>where you wouldn't get an email to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>assignment.</v>

527
00:24:51.471 --> 00:24:53.390
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear,</v>

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm haven't seen you in years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope you're well.</v>

530
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations on all you've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

531
00:25:04.251 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should get coffee sometime.</v>

532
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.630
<v Speaker 1>If you could do me a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

533
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.730

<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

<v Speaker 1>prize for my design,</v>

535
00:25:17.091 --> 00:25:17.361
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

536
00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:18.920
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope you're well.</v>

537
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Talk to you soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny.</v>

538
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all received an email like that</v>

539
00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:27.950
<v Speaker 1>and how do we respond to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

540
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:30.260
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you get the same email</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes like this?</v>

541
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Dear Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping you could vote for me on this</v>

542
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:36.890
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to win some thousand dollar</v>

543
00:25:36.891 --> 00:25:40.130
<v Speaker 1>prize for my design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen you in years.</v>

544
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I hope you're really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations on all that you've been</v>

545
00:25:43.401 --> 00:25:44.900
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should get a coffee sometime.</v>

546
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Kenny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally different.</v>

547
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.440
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we know why you're emailing and it</v>

548
00:25:51.441 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>comes first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a remarkable impact.</v>

549
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.770
<v Speaker 1>We know that all those pleasantries or</v>
<v Speaker 1>just buttering us up to get to what they</v>

550
00:25:57.771 --> 00:25:59.030
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

551
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.890
<v Speaker 1>But if you come right out with what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

552
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.690
<v Speaker 1>we're actually very grateful for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasantries,</v>

553
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:04.423
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

554
00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:06.650
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing in human</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

555
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't give someone a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need a favor back,</v>

556
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.390
<v Speaker 1>just ask them for the favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It builds trust.</v>

557
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you do something nice for me,</v>

558
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:18.440
<v Speaker 1>I think you just something you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>something from me,</v>

559
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.620
<v Speaker 1>I won't trust you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what companies do to us</v>

560
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.050
<v Speaker 1>right when we did this for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why won't you do this for us?</v>

561
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.300
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generosity,</v>

562
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.330
<v Speaker 1>bending down to pick up the papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding the door open for someone is</v>

563
00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:33.380
<v Speaker 1>expecting nothing in return ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do not give,</v>

564
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what happens in new business,</v>

565
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:36.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We be new.</v>

566
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Business is built on relationships and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we build the relationship,</v>

567
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 1>build the relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build the relationship until we're</v>

568
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:42.740
<v Speaker 1>comfortable to ask for the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

569
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:47.490
<v Speaker 1>you were befriending me to the point you</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt that I would let down my guard and</v>

570
00:26:47.491 --> 00:26:50.370
<v Speaker 1>you could ask me for something the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>time you were just waiting for that</v>

571
00:26:50.371 --> 00:26:51.204
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

572
00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you actually want to build</v>

573
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:56.910
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build relationships without wanting</v>

574
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:01.050
<v Speaker 1>anything and that's how you build trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to know why?</v>

575
00:27:01.051 --> 00:27:03.690
<v Speaker 1>The Marines gave me this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>access.</v>

576
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

577
00:27:05.221 --> 00:27:06.720
<v Speaker 1>anything you want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got it.</v>

578
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Anything you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got it.</v>

579
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.770
<v Speaker 1>You can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we went past sign that said no</v>

580
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>observers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no civilians beyond this point.</v>

581
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I take pictures of like,</v>

582
00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should see some of the pictures.</v>

583
00:27:17.131 --> 00:27:18.780
<v Speaker 1>They're unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

584
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in their marines coming at me,</v>

585
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.250
<v Speaker 1>we went out to the crucible and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling in the dirt and like,</v>

586
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going under barbed wire and I'm like,</v>

587
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

588
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented access access that</v>

589
00:27:36.001 --> 00:27:38.760
<v Speaker 1>journalists would be jealous of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know why they gave it to me?</v>

590
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Because in all the time that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>visiting with marines and then having</v>

591
00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:44.490
<v Speaker 1>meetings with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never asked for anything.</v>

592
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anything and I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to sell.</v>

593
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I just keep showing up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you need?</v>

594
00:27:48.481 --> 00:27:50.730
<v Speaker 1>How can I help?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at some point they said,</v>

595
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.920
<v Speaker 1>when I called him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a little favor because they know</v>

596
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been waiting for the favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the time now that I have a little</v>

597
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.680
<v Speaker 1>favor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go absolutely whatever you need.</v>

598
00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:02.610
<v Speaker 1>It's called human relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Companies don't do business with</v>

599
00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do business with people</v>

600
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.710
<v Speaker 1>you know your company didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When IBM,</v>

601
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 1>as a client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who likes somebody said,</v>

602
00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:12.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll hire you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they didn't like you,</v>

603
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.840
<v Speaker 1>they're just there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing,</v>

604
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.850
<v Speaker 1>they're playing roulette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're betting that this will work</v>

605
00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.670
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the weaker relationships.</v>

606
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.623
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

607
00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.450
<v Speaker 1>The more we gave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more it inspires others to give,</v>

608
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.720
<v Speaker 1>but the more selfish we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more others become selfish around</v>

609
00:28:30.721 --> 00:28:32.760
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are organizations in which</v>

610
00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:36.420
<v Speaker 1>selfish behavior perfect prevails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we see the residual effects,</v>

611
00:28:36.421 --> 00:28:39.480
<v Speaker 1>which is they make decisions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately screw us.</v>

612
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.960
<v Speaker 1>They destroyed our economy because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their selfish behavior.</v>

613
00:28:41.961 --> 00:28:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know this is what,</v>

614
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.310
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

615
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Same in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

616
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

617
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.050
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds silly.</v>

618
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your first question is do I talk about</v>

619
00:28:54.511 --> 00:28:56.910
<v Speaker 1>these things to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will talk to anyone who will listen,</v>

620
00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't talk to people who don't</v>

621
00:29:00.811 --> 00:29:03.780
<v Speaker 1>want to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news is there are some good</v>

622
00:29:03.781 --> 00:29:08.760
<v Speaker 1>eggs and there are some of them who've</v>
<v Speaker 1>had conversions where they were the</v>

623
00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:12.240
<v Speaker 1>bastards who believed in firing people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and screen people to advance their</v>

624
00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:14.190
<v Speaker 1>careers and something happens.</v>

625
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I just met a guy recently who's a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>senior executive at very,</v>

626
00:29:16.861 --> 00:29:19.740
<v Speaker 1>very large company and something</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and he,</v>

627
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.470
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got hit in the head or something and</v>

628
00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:25.650
<v Speaker 1>he realized holy cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to look after people.</v>

629
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they become obsessed with it and</v>

630
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:31.770
<v Speaker 1>they start sticking their necks out and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just need those champions</v>

631
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.280
<v Speaker 1>scattered around and this is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more I spread this message,</v>

632
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.230
<v Speaker 1>the more sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind,</v>

633
00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.133
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

634
00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

635
00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.470
<v Speaker 1>in the cartoons sort of the whole of</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>

636
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:43.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the message goes out and they all</v>

637
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 1>sort of like wherever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

638
00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they poke their heads up.</v>

639
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:48.700
<v Speaker 1>It's that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more we talk about it,</v>

640
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.750
<v Speaker 1>the more we put it in our work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the know,</v>

641
00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.590
<v Speaker 1>because don't forget you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help someone who goes home feeling good</v>

642
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.780
<v Speaker 1>and their husband or their wife works in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bank and they're going to talk too</v>

643
00:29:56.781 --> 00:29:57.340
<v Speaker 1>much about.</v>

644
00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 1>They love to and that might inspire that</v>
<v Speaker 1>per,</v>

645
00:29:59.170 --> 00:29:59.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

646
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 1>it has all of these residual impacts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't really know.</v>

647
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:04.300
<v Speaker 1>This is the funny thing about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

648
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.970
<v Speaker 1>which is we're so proud of the internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can measure everything.</v>

649
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

650
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 1>You can only measure one layer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

651
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.081
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

652
00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the impact you're having?</v>

653
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is The answer right?</v>

654
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.573
<v Speaker 1>I know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

655
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I know that it'll take more than a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I will take seven years,</v>

656
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.320
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know when it's gonna happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know how it's going to get</v>

657
00:30:20.321 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

658
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:24.910
<v Speaker 1>All I can do is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is do it right,</v>

659
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.780
<v Speaker 1>but I have no clue how or when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

660
00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I can measure book sales and I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure how many hits and I can measure</v>

661
00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 1>how many people have watched a ted talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of this,</v>

662
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.350
<v Speaker 1>but I can't measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

663
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 1>that Ted talk being shown to a room of</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 people and one of those 50 people</v>

664
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:42.190
<v Speaker 1>doesn't buy a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't watch a Ted talk,</v>

665
00:30:42.191 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do anything but goes out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>does something good for somebody else.</v>

666
00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I have no way of measuring that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're so proud of the internet</v>

667
00:30:47.981 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 1>and its ability to measure everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're measuring one layer where we</v>

668
00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:53.890
<v Speaker 1>used to measure no layers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

669
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how people work.</v>

670
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 1>It's Gossamer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

671
00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.500
<v Speaker 1>it's networked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

672
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.150
<v Speaker 1>and so the answer is don't worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

673
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.690
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about the people who you can care</v>

674
00:31:04.691 --> 00:31:05.980
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you can give to.</v>

675
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.020
<v Speaker 1>And when we reach a critical mass in</v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

676
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.840
<v Speaker 1>it will tip right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't believe me,</v>

677
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.480
<v Speaker 1>the reason it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it is now is because it tip the</v>

678
00:31:13.481 --> 00:31:15.790
<v Speaker 1>wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no such thing as massive</v>

679
00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 1>layoffs as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as business strategy prior to</v>

680
00:31:17.831 --> 00:31:20.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in the 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't done.</v>

681
00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 1>It was done here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't strategy.</v>

682
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 1>The idea of using layoffs to balance the</v>
<v Speaker 1>books is a relatively new phenomenon</v>

683
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.290
<v Speaker 1>that came for the increase of</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfishness in the Gordon Gekko greed is</v>

684
00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:29.620
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

685
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

686
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

687
00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.950
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was also the same exact period,</v>

688
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:39.940
<v Speaker 1>the 19 eighties where the theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theory of shareholder value is put</v>

689
00:31:39.941 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 1>forwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

690
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Because they had all these people buying</v>
<v Speaker 1>large companies and installing</v>

691
00:31:43.871 --> 00:31:45.760
<v Speaker 1>professional managers to run the</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that they bought,</v>

692
00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:48.610
<v Speaker 1>that they invested in and they had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem which is those professional</v>

693
00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:51.970
<v Speaker 1>managers were paid for by the company</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those professional managers cared</v>

694
00:31:51.971 --> 00:31:54.460
<v Speaker 1>for the employees and the customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the investor said,</v>

695
00:31:54.461 --> 00:31:56.710
<v Speaker 1>how do we protect our investments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got an idea,</v>

696
00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.700
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give them equity in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>company and bonus them based on the</v>

697
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.530
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

698
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.790
<v Speaker 1>And so the shift happened where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>CEO's started caring more about the</v>

699
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:09.100
<v Speaker 1>investors and stopped caring about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>customers and employees.</v>

700
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Those were theories introduced by some</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard professor in the 19 eighties.</v>

701
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.020
<v Speaker 1>We can push it back the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

702
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.440
<v Speaker 1>We can push it back the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

703
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.760
<v Speaker 1>but we just have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's just a,</v>

704
00:32:21.761 --> 00:32:22.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

705
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the other day.</v>

706
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Which company was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A one of the large banks where the</v>

707
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:29.890
<v Speaker 1>shareholder in Citibank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Citibank,</v>

708
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Citibank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shareholders voted majority</v>

709
00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:36.820
<v Speaker 1>shareholders voted against a fat pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>package.</v>

710
00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.430
<v Speaker 1>That's unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has never happened even in hard</v>

711
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:42.170
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when the company is doing this,</v>

712
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.440
<v Speaker 1>the shareholders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just sort of a cursory thing where</v>

713
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 1>they approved the $15,000,000 bonus for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CEO.</v>

714
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.830
<v Speaker 1>They voted against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nonbinding,</v>

715
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 1>but it sends a shot across the bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying shareholders now want you to be</v>

716
00:32:55.281 --> 00:33:00.020
<v Speaker 1>bonused if you do something good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

717
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:04.930
<v Speaker 1>even if the others is us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

718
00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.080
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's,</v>

719
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.050
<v Speaker 1>it's starting to crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so let's just stick our finger in</v>

720
00:33:11.051 --> 00:33:12.930
<v Speaker 1>the crack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

721
00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.970
<v Speaker 1>make sure that it keeps cracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It swung one way.</v>

722
00:33:15.971 --> 00:33:18.610
<v Speaker 1>We can swing it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question was can I talk about</v>

723
00:33:18.611 --> 00:33:21.190
<v Speaker 1>celebrating accomplishment while still</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking for more?</v>

724
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Right to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to so,</v>

725
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.430
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

726
00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.560
<v Speaker 1>they did a study on kids who are really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really smart,</v>

727
00:33:29.561 --> 00:33:31.450
<v Speaker 1>like an old gifted classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it when you're smart,</v>

728
00:33:31.451 --> 00:33:32.320
<v Speaker 1>you're gifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're stupid,</v>

729
00:33:32.321 --> 00:33:33.220
<v Speaker 1>you're special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

730
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I was told my whole life I was special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never gifted.</v>

731
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>

732
00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:47.790
<v Speaker 1>they took the gifted kids who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly told,</v>

733
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.440
<v Speaker 1>you're so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

734
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.000
<v Speaker 1>thanks for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew you'd do well.</v>

735
00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:51.893
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the,</v>

736
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.150
<v Speaker 1>you're our best employee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know our best student.</v>

737
00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.410
<v Speaker 1>You're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

738
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:58.860
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is later in life they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually suffer because they're very</v>

739
00:33:58.861 --> 00:34:01.920
<v Speaker 1>afraid of taking risk because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>very afraid of losing their position on</v>

740
00:34:01.921 --> 00:34:03.680
<v Speaker 1>the mental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

741
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Kids who were sort of more average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who constantly are rewarded not for</v>

742
00:34:07.351 --> 00:34:08.910
<v Speaker 1>their accomplishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for their effort,</v>

743
00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:12.090
<v Speaker 1>great effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really proud of the improvement you</v>

744
00:34:12.091 --> 00:34:15.240
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they find is they do very well in</v>

745
00:34:15.241 --> 00:34:19.320
<v Speaker 1>life because there's no shelf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always more,</v>

746
00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:20.940
<v Speaker 1>there's more effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

747
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to reward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge effort.</v>

748
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Even if they don't hit the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that the delta.</v>

749
00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:31.170
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it goes backwards,</v>

750
00:34:31.171 --> 00:34:31.760
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

751
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.640
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

752
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't be getting ribbons for</v>

753
00:34:34.771 --> 00:34:36.390
<v Speaker 1>everyone who competes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

754
00:34:36.391 --> 00:34:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Because what we're teaching people is if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do nothing,</v>

755
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.550
<v Speaker 1>you get a metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

756
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing is is we start</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating a generation that's feeling</v>

757
00:34:45.451 --> 00:34:49.560
<v Speaker 1>very hollow and feeling this sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>entitlement that people complain about</v>

758
00:34:49.561 --> 00:34:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Gen y.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entitlement is I don't feel like</v>

759
00:34:51.931 --> 00:34:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I've accomplished anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing is about human</v>

760
00:34:54.271 --> 00:34:55.800
<v Speaker 1>beings is we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

761
00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:00.830
<v Speaker 1>the way we feel accomplished is when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>exert energy and time and reach a</v>

762
00:35:01.621 --> 00:35:02.970
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

763
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.850
<v Speaker 1>And the more energy and time that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to suffer through,</v>

764
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.060
<v Speaker 1>especially if we suffer together and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>get somewhere,</v>

765
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.570
<v Speaker 1>it is overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the best jobs you've ever</v>

766
00:35:12.571 --> 00:35:14.340
<v Speaker 1>worked on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it the best design?</v>

767
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Was it the best results that the company</v>
<v Speaker 1>had because of your project?</v>

768
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Or was it an absolute hell project that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you worked together and you came out on</v>

769
00:35:23.131 --> 00:35:25.920
<v Speaker 1>the other end and you got it done at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadline and you're like,</v>

770
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.540
<v Speaker 1>that was amazing.</v>

771
00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.410
<v Speaker 1>It was the hell projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the things that we had to go out</v>

772
00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:34.200
<v Speaker 1>of our ways more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do things for each other,</v>

773
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:35.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things we weren't thinking of doing.</v>

774
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I was wrapping packages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing stuff that aren't designers on</v>

775
00:35:38.611 --> 00:35:39.780
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

776
00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:42.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what produces that.</v>

777
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

778
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is about measurement and</v>

779
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 1>destination reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine we're standing in a big empty</v>

780
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

781
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 1>And we're standing in one corner and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you a simple instruction.</v>

782
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I want you to go to that corner in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight line,</v>

783
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 1>right off you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no big deal,</v>

784
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without telling you,</v>

785
00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 1>I slip a chair in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

786
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.280
<v Speaker 1>You go around the chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

787
00:36:08.281 --> 00:36:09.600
<v Speaker 1>you just disobeyed what I told you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

788
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I told you to go to that corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight line,</v>

789
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.590
<v Speaker 1>but this is the amazing things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

790
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.690
<v Speaker 1>which is when we're given a clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>

791
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Speaker 1>we use our own creativity and our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of innovation and our own problem</v>

792
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 1>solving abilities to overcome obstacles</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get to the destination.</v>

793
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.930
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the destination is more important than</v>

794
00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:26.460
<v Speaker 1>the route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

795
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 1>We're flexible about the route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're obsessed with the destination</v>

796
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.500
<v Speaker 1>reset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're standing in the corner together</v>

797
00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:34.500
<v Speaker 1>and I give you a simple instruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go somewhere in this room in a straight</v>

798
00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:36.120
<v Speaker 1>line and you say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

799
00:36:36.121 --> 00:36:36.841
<v Speaker 1>where do you want me to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

800
00:36:36.841 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're smart.</v>

801
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go in a straight line,</v>

802
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.870
<v Speaker 1>and so you pick a point and you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking and without telling you,</v>

803
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I put a chair in front of you and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you?</v>

804
00:36:43.981 --> 00:36:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Do you come to a grinding halt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>

805
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:47.250
<v Speaker 1>what'd you stop for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

806
00:36:47.251 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put a chair in front of me or you'll</v>

807
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:51.630
<v Speaker 1>make a sudden turn on going in another</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

808
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the problem.</v>

809
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:56.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the same obstacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The differences.</v>

810
00:36:56.101 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 1>When you have a clear set of clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>

811
00:36:57.931 --> 00:37:00.450
<v Speaker 1>the obstacles become easy to overcome.</v>

812
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.240
<v Speaker 1>When you don't have a clear destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep coming to a grinding halt.</v>

813
00:37:03.241 --> 00:37:06.240
<v Speaker 1>And what we do in our companies is we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>counting the steps we're taking along</v>

814
00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:08.130
<v Speaker 1>the route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whenever looking at the destination,</v>

815
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:09.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So company says,</v>

816
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.870
<v Speaker 1>made a million dollars this year we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>only planning on making $800,000.</v>

817
00:37:12.871 --> 00:37:14.700
<v Speaker 1>We took 10 steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're planning on taking eight,</v>

818
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.860
<v Speaker 1>where are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No clue,</v>

819
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We count the steps.</v>

820
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.080
<v Speaker 1>And so the point is is that people want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel that the effort that they're</v>

821
00:37:22.081 --> 00:37:25.620
<v Speaker 1>exerting actually are moving somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so successful measurement,</v>

822
00:37:25.621 --> 00:37:28.260
<v Speaker 1>successful recognition is not just for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the steps you take,</v>

823
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not just for the effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that the effort you exerted moved</v>

824
00:37:31.621 --> 00:37:35.490
<v Speaker 1>us closer to where we're trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to and that get to should be some crazy</v>

825
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:38.130
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ideal is to live in a world in which</v>

826
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:41.880
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of people wake up</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single morning inspired to go to</v>

827
00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:43.440
<v Speaker 1>work and fulfilled by the work that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

828
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

829
00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 1>the couple of measurements that I use</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

830
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.300
<v Speaker 1>if the book is selling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

831
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.200
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people ask me,</v>

832
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:50.940
<v Speaker 1>how many have you sold?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no clue.</v>

833
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I've never asked the publisher because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't care.</v>

834
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I really don't care how many I sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I care about is the Amazon rankings</v>

835
00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 1>and that those are going steady or up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not plummeting because that means</v>

836
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.390
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

837
00:38:03.391 --> 00:38:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't have a publicist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a marketing strategy on</v>

838
00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:07.560
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't hire one of those companies to</v>

839
00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:10.080
<v Speaker 1>sell the book for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is is because I'm not</v>

840
00:38:10.081 --> 00:38:12.570
<v Speaker 1>interested in book sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in the spreading of an</v>

841
00:38:12.571 --> 00:38:16.710
<v Speaker 1>idea and so I just used that as a metric</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help me understand am I sort of</v>

842
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:19.050
<v Speaker 1>marching in the because the more I</v>
<v Speaker 1>preach,</v>

843
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.240
<v Speaker 1>is it resonating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

844
00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.750
<v Speaker 1>and so you have a couple of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfect measurements that help you</v>

845
00:38:24.751 --> 00:38:28.890
<v Speaker 1>understand are you going along the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not just great effort.</v>

846
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Look what you achieved because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing now,</v>

847
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our goal is to increase top line</v>

848
00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:37.330
<v Speaker 1>revenues by $50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars for what reason?</v>

849
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is we have to know the destination</v>

850
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 1>and then we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

851
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:46.240
<v Speaker 1>You took us that much closer and if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the right,</v>

852
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.220
<v Speaker 1>it's because we were overcoming an</v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle.</v>

853
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.820
<v Speaker 1>If we hadn't gone to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would've been stuck forever.</v>

854
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

855
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.010
<v Speaker 1>it's not always straight lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not always straight lines,</v>

856
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in one direction.</v>

857
00:38:59.111 --> 00:39:02.110
<v Speaker 1>She's playing the cane up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very,</v>

858
00:39:02.111 --> 00:39:02.944
<v Speaker 1>very much.</v>

859
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
