1
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>So I'm embarrassed that I have a career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about things like trust and</v>

2
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>cooperation and there should be no</v>
<v Speaker 1>demand for my work,</v>

3
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>but the fact of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there is demand for my work,</v>

4
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>which means that there's an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that trust and cooperation are</v>

5
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>not yet standard in our organizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet they should be.</v>

6
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And we know that which is why we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for ways to bring those things</v>

7
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>to our organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I would do something a</v>

8
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>little different today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

9
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>when you're speaking to tens of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people and you have the</v>

10
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:46.760
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to share a message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

11
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>most rational people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go with something I've talked</v>

12
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>about lots of times and I'm really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

13
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to do something completely</v>

14
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>new and I hope this works out.</v>

15
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two things that I think the</v>

16
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 1>great leaders need to have empathy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

17
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>And I think these things are very often</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten.</v>

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Leaders are so often and so concerned</v>
<v Speaker 1>about their status of their position in</v>

19
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>and organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually forget their real job and</v>

20
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>the real job of a leader is not about</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in charge.</v>

21
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.300
<v Speaker 1>It's about taking care of those in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge and I don't think people realize</v>

22
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:25.940
<v Speaker 1>this and I don't think people train for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this when we're junior.</v>

23
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Our only responsibility is to be good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>our jobs.</v>

24
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>That's all we really have to do and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people actually go get advanced</v>

25
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 1>educations on so that they can be really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at their jobs.</v>

26
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Accountants or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

27
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>and you show up and you work hard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company will give us tons and tons</v>

28
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>of training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do our jobs.</v>

29
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>They'll show us how to use the software.</v>

30
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 1>They'll send us away for a few days to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get trained in whatever it is that we're</v>

31
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:54.800
<v Speaker 1>doing for the company and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect us to go be good at our jobs and</v>

32
00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>that's what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We worked very hard and if you're good</v>

33
00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>at your job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll promote you and at some point</v>

34
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.920
<v Speaker 1>you'll get promoted to a position where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are now responsible for the people</v>

35
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 1>who do the job we used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody shows us how to do that and</v>

36
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:14.480
<v Speaker 1>that's why we get managers and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders because the reason that our</v>

37
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>managers are micromanaging us is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually do know how to.</v>

38
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:21.410
<v Speaker 1>They do do the job better than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what got them promoted.</v>

39
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Really what we have to do is go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transition.</v>

40
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Some people make it quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people make it slowly and</v>

41
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:30.560
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately some people will never</v>
<v Speaker 1>make that transition at all,</v>

42
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 1>which is we have to go this through.</v>

43
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.140
<v Speaker 1>This transition of being responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job and then turning into somebody</v>

44
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>who's now responsible for the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the job.</v>

45
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 1>And as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great things that is lacking</v>

46
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:47.690
<v Speaker 1>in most of our companies is that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not teaching us how to lead.</v>

47
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 1>And leadership is a skill like any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a practice double learnable skill,</v>

48
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.780
<v Speaker 1>and it is something that you work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a muscle.</v>

49
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.140
<v Speaker 1>If you practice it all the days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will get good at it and you will</v>

50
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>become a strong leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stop practicing,</v>

51
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>you will become a weak leader like</v>
<v Speaker 1>parenting.</v>

52
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has the capacity to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>parent,</v>

53
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to be a parent and</v>

54
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean everybody shouldn't be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparent leadership is the same.</v>

55
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>We all have the capacity to be a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean everybody should be a</v>

56
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>leader and it doesn't mean everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be a leader.</v>

57
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.710
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is because it comes at</v>
<v Speaker 1>great personal sacrifice.</v>

58
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in charge,</v>

59
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for those in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>charge.</v>

60
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>That means things like when everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes right,</v>

61
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>you have to give away all the credit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when everything goes wrong,</v>

62
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>you have to take all the responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sucks,</v>

63
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's things like staying late to show</v>

64
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>somebody what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's things like when something does</v>

65
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>actually break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when something goes wrong,</v>

66
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>instead of yelling and screaming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking over,</v>

67
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.110
<v Speaker 1>you say try again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the overwhelming pressures are not</v>

68
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overwhelming pressures are on us.</v>

69
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great leaders are not responsible for</v>

70
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're responsible for the people who</v>

71
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>are responsible for the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not even responsible for the</v>

72
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love talking to ceos and say,</v>

73
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 1>what's your priority?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they put their hands on.</v>

74
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Their hips will proudly say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my priority is my customer.</v>

75
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even talked to a customer in 15 years.</v>

76
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>There's no CEO on the planet responsible</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the customer.</v>

77
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>They're just not the responsible for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are responsible for the</v>

78
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>people who are responsible for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer.</v>

79
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a true story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few months ago I stayed at the four</v>

80
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:43.621
<v Speaker 1>seasons in Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a wonderful hotel and the reason</v>

81
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a wonderful hotel is not because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fancy beds.</v>

82
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:51.901
<v Speaker 1>Any hotel can go and buy a fancy bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason it's a wonderful hotel is</v>

83
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>because of the people who work there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you walk past somebody at the four</v>

84
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>seasons and this and they say hello to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

85
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 1>you get the feeling that they actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to say hello to you.</v>

86
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not that somebody told them that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to say a load of all the</v>

87
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say hello to all the guests.</v>

88
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually feel that they care now in</v>

89
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:12.320
<v Speaker 1>their lobby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a coffee stand and I want.</v>

90
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.490
<v Speaker 1>One afternoon I went to buy a cup of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee and there was a Barista by the</v>

91
00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>name of Noah who was serving me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noah was fantastic.</v>

92
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>He was friendly and fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was engaging with me and I had so</v>

93
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 1>much fun buying a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think I gave 100 percent tip,</v>

94
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was wonderful.</v>

95
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.540
<v Speaker 1>So as is my nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked Noah,</v>

96
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>do you like your job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And without skipping a beat,</v>

97
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Noah says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my job,</v>

98
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>and so I followed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

99
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>what is it that the four seasons is</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that would make you say to me,</v>

100
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I love my job and without skipping a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat,</v>

101
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Noah said throughout the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>managers will walk past me and asked me</v>

102
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.320
<v Speaker 1>how I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's anything that I need to do my</v>

103
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 1>job better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

104
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:57.340
<v Speaker 1>not just my manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any manager,</v>

105
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Speaker 1>and then he said something magical.</v>

106
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also work at Caesar's Palace and</v>

107
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Caesar's at Caesar's palace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The managers are trying to make sure</v>

108
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>we're doing everything right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They catch us when we do things wrong.</v>

109
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I go to work there,</v>

110
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I like to keep my head under the radar</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just get through the day so I can</v>

111
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>get my paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

112
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 1>here at the four seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel I can be myself.</v>

113
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Same person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely different experience from the,</v>

114
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>from the customer who will engage with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noah,</v>

115
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>so we in leadership are always</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing.</v>

116
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>The people were always saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to get the right people on the</v>

117
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:36.404
<v Speaker 1>bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a film.</v>

118
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Ironic my team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get the right people,</v>

119
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is it's not the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the leadership.</v>

120
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.210
<v Speaker 1>If we create the right environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will get people like Noah at the four</v>

121
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:48.044
<v Speaker 1>seasons.</v>

122
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>If we create the wrong environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will get people like Noah at Caesar's</v>

123
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>palace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the people,</v>

124
00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.190
<v Speaker 1>and yet we're so quick to hire and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't hire and fire your children if</v>

125
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>your kids are struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't say,</v>

126
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>you got to see at school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're up for adoption,</v>

127
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>so why is it that when somebody has</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance problems at work,</v>

128
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>why is it that our instinct is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out.</v>

129
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 1>We do not practice empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does empathy look like?</v>

130
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Here's the lack of empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is normal in our business world.</v>

131
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>You walk into someone's office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone walks into our office and says,</v>

132
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 1>your numbers have been down for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>third quarter in a row.</v>

133
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 1>You have to pick up your numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

134
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 1>I can't guarantee what the future will</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like.</v>

135
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.310
<v Speaker 1>How inspired you think that person is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to work the next day?</v>

136
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Here's what empathy looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You walk into someone's office,</v>

137
00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 1>someone walks into your office and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your numbers of down for the third</v>

138
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:46.220
<v Speaker 1>quarter in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you okay?</v>

139
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

140
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 1>We all have performance issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone's kid is sick.</v>

141
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they having problems in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

142
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one of their parents is dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what's going on in their</v>

143
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course it will affect performance</v>

144
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:03.680
<v Speaker 1>at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Empathy is being concerned about the</v>

145
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 1>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just their output.</v>

146
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.550
<v Speaker 1>We have for some reason our work world</v>
<v Speaker 1>has changed over the past 20 and 30</v>

147
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:16.430
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are suffering the side effects of</v>

148
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:21.431
<v Speaker 1>business theories left over from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties and nineties and they are bad</v>

149
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>for people and they are bad for</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

150
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The concept of shareholder supremacy was</v>

151
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:35.210
<v Speaker 1>a theory proposed in the late 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

152
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It was popularized in the eighties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

153
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.340
<v Speaker 1>It is now standard form today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talked to any public company and you</v>

154
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:47.960
<v Speaker 1>ask them their priority and they say</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximize shareholder value.</v>

155
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a coach prioritizing the</v>

156
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Speaker 1>needs of the fans over the needs of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>players.</v>

157
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to build a winning</v>
<v Speaker 1>team with that model,</v>

158
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>but that's normal today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even perceive it as broken or</v>

159
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>damaged or wrong or outdated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the eighties and nineties were</v>

160
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>boom years with relative peace and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinder,</v>

161
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:10.800
<v Speaker 1>gentler cold war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was practicing,</v>

162
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 1>hiding under their desks in school</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

163
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 1>We are no longer in those times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are no longer boom years.</v>

164
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.810
<v Speaker 1>These are no longer peaceful times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those models cannot work today.</v>

165
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 1>Here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mass layoffs.</v>

166
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Using someone's livelihood to balance</v>
<v Speaker 1>the books,</v>

167
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so normal in America today that we</v>

168
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>don't even understand how broken and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>damaging it is,</v>

169
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>not only to human beings but to</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

170
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies talking about how they want to</v>

171
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>build trust and cooperation and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they announced a round of layoffs.</v>

172
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the quickest way to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust and destroy cooperation and a</v>

173
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:54.801
<v Speaker 1>business literally in one day lay people</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and everyone gets scared,</v>

174
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine sending someone home to</v>

175
00:09:58.141 --> 00:09:58.621
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

176
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I can no longer provide for our family</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the company missed its arbitrary</v>

177
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 1>projections this year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and forget about the people who lost</v>

178
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>their job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the people who kept their</v>

179
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>jobs because every single decision a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company makes as a piece of</v>

180
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:15.840
<v Speaker 1>communication and the company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company has just communicated to</v>

181
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 1>everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a meritocracy.</v>

182
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>We don't care how hard you work or how</v>
<v Speaker 1>long you've worked here.</v>

183
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 1>If we miss our numbers and you happen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall on the wrong side of the</v>

184
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>spreadsheet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

185
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 1>we cannot guarantee employment.</v>

186
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we come to work everyday afraid and</v>

187
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 1>we're asking our youngest generation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work in environments where.</v>

188
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:40.890
<v Speaker 1>How would any of us ever stand up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>admit I made a mistake?</v>

189
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.770
<v Speaker 1>We're cousins being told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be vulnerable.</v>

190
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Leaders are vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that even mean?</v>

191
00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:48.810
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you walk around crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm vulnerable,</v>

192
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what vulnerability means is you</v>

193
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:56.250
<v Speaker 1>create an environment in which someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels safe enough to raise their hand</v>

194
00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm doing.</v>

195
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 1>You've given me a job and I haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained to do it.</v>

196
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I need help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a mistake.</v>

197
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I screwed something up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared.</v>

198
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these things,</v>

199
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:15.360
<v Speaker 1>no one would ever admit inside a company</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it puts a target on your head in</v>

200
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:19.380
<v Speaker 1>case there is another round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we keep it to ourselves and how</v>

201
00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:22.770
<v Speaker 1>can a company ever do well if nobody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever willing to admit they made a</v>

202
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>mistake that's scared or they don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing,</v>

203
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.380
<v Speaker 1>and so we've literally created cultures</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which every single day everybody</v>

204
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 1>comes to work in light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high lies highs and fakes,</v>

205
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:37.460
<v Speaker 1>and we're asking our youngest generation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work and succeed and find themselves</v>

206
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>and build their confidence and overcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>their addiction to technology and build</v>

207
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>strong relationships at work.</v>

208
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Speaker 1>We're asking them to do this and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments we've created.</v>

209
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.860
<v Speaker 1>We keep saying to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the future leaders.</v>

210
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 1>We're the leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

211
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 1>we're in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>

212
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>This is what empathy means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means if there's an entire generation</v>

213
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not them.</v>

214
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.551
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:10.030
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the common factor in all my failed</v>

216
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:15.031
<v Speaker 1>relationships me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

217
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just can't get the right performance</v>

218
00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 1>out of our people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's you're right.</v>

219
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not a generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not them.</v>

220
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 1>They're not difficult or hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

221
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 1>They're human beings like the rest of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to find their way,</v>

222
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 1>trying to work in a place where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that someone cares about them as a</v>

223
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:37.120
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

224
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 1>that's what we all want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

225
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not even generational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all of us.</v>

226
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 1>This is the practice of empathy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have wished,</v>

227
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:50.860
<v Speaker 1>struggling to communicate to someone if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's struggling to help someone be at</v>

228
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 1>their natural best.</v>

229
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of people saying to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I get the best out of my people?</v>

230
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you want.</v>

231
00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 1>They're like a towel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just ring them.</v>

232
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.020
<v Speaker 1>How can I get the most out of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

233
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>How do I help my people be at their</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural best,</v>

234
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not asking these questions.</v>

235
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 1>We are not practicing empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to start by practicing empathy</v>

236
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.220
<v Speaker 1>and relate to what they may be going</v>
<v Speaker 1>through and it will profoundly change</v>

237
00:13:13.221 --> 00:13:16.900
<v Speaker 1>the decisions we make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will profoundly change the way we see</v>

238
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:20.260
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's driving to work.</v>

239
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.530
<v Speaker 1>You're driving to work and someone wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to cut into your lane.</v>

240
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.290
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pull your car up with you.</v>

241
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Let them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of us pull our cars up and go like</v>

242
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:31.450
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wait your turn.</v>

243
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Now let's practice empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

244
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they've been out of work for six</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

245
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they had trouble getting the kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to school this morning and now</v>

246
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>they're running late for a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important interview and they just have</v>

247
00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 1>to get to this interview and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to cut into our lane or maybe</v>

248
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:46.300
<v Speaker 1>they're just a bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

249
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:50.490
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

250
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.780
<v Speaker 1>that's the point we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know,</v>

251
00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.080
<v Speaker 1>and the practice of empathy will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let them in and I'll arrive to work</v>

252
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.150
<v Speaker 1>one car length lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

253
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.580
<v Speaker 1>We don't always have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

254
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.990
<v Speaker 1>We don't always have to be in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to be the one who</v>

255
00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:12.270
<v Speaker 1>succeeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about winning or losing,</v>

256
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.200
<v Speaker 1>and that's where I go to the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>point after empathy comes perspective</v>

257
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:24.170
<v Speaker 1>where it's not about winning or losing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Game Theory,</v>

258
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.020
<v Speaker 1>there are two kinds of games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are finite games and there are</v>

259
00:14:28.021 --> 00:14:31.560
<v Speaker 1>infinite games and this is how you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to change your perspective,</v>

260
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A finite game is defined as known</v>

261
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:39.270
<v Speaker 1>players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed rules and an agreed upon objective</v>

262
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.580
<v Speaker 1>baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

263
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.280
<v Speaker 1>we know the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all agreed to the rules and whoever</v>

264
00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:47.700
<v Speaker 1>has more runs at the end of nine innings</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the winner and the game is over.</v>

265
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.800
<v Speaker 1>No one ever says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can just play two more innings,</v>

266
00:14:49.801 --> 00:14:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I know we can come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't work that way.</v>

267
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 1>The game is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

268
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a finite game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have an infinite game.</v>

269
00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Infinite Games are defined as known and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown players.</v>

270
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.480
<v Speaker 1>The rules are changeable and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective is to keep the game in play,</v>

271
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 1>to perpetuate the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you pit a finite player versus a</v>

272
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:14.600
<v Speaker 1>finite player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system is stable.</v>

273
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Baseball is stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

274
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 1>When you put an infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an infinite player versus an infinite</v>

275
00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system is also stable like the cold</v>

276
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 1>war for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there cannot be a winner and a</v>

277
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:28.580
<v Speaker 1>loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no winners and losers in an</v>

278
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:30.020
<v Speaker 1>infinite game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

279
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:32.930
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist and because there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>no winners or losers,</v>

280
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:35.090
<v Speaker 1>what ends up happening in the infinite</v>
<v Speaker 1>contest,</v>

281
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.920
<v Speaker 1>his players drop out when they run out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the will or the resources to play,</v>

282
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 1>but there's no winners or losers.</v>

283
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Problems arise when you pit a finite</v>
<v Speaker 1>player versus an infinite player because</v>

284
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 1>in a finite player is playing to win and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an infinite player is playing to keep</v>

285
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 1>the game going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

286
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.110
<v Speaker 1>This is what happened to us in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were playing to win and the</v>

287
00:15:57.111 --> 00:15:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Vietnamese were fighting for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

288
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.460
<v Speaker 1>We were the ones who got stuck in</v>
<v Speaker 1>quagmire.</v>

289
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.530
<v Speaker 1>This was the Soviet Union and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan.</v>

290
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to beat the Mujahideen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the majority and would fight for as</v>

291
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:09.920
<v Speaker 1>long as is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quagmire.</v>

292
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look at business.</v>

293
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:17.020
<v Speaker 1>The game of business has preexisted or</v>
<v Speaker 1>has existed long before every single</v>

294
00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 1>company that exists on this planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

295
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.500
<v Speaker 1>and it will outlast every single company</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he lives that exists on this planet</v>

296
00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:28.190
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no winning the game of business,</v>

297
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.220
<v Speaker 1>and the reason is is because we haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreed to the rules.</v>

298
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.470
<v Speaker 1>I get such a kick out of this.</v>

299
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.890
<v Speaker 1>You realize how many companies actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know the game they're in,</v>

300
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to the language of the companies</v>

301
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:40.610
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to beat our competition.</v>

302
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.180
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to be number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that we were ranked number</v>

303
00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 1>one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the listing based on what</v>

304
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:48.170
<v Speaker 1>criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenues,</v>

305
00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:50.120
<v Speaker 1>profits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketshare square footage,</v>

306
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 1>number of employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on what timeframe?</v>

307
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:53.840
<v Speaker 1>A quarter a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years,</v>

308
00:16:53.841 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>

309
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:55.820
<v Speaker 1>50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years.</v>

310
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I haven't agreed to those standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you declare yourself the winner?</v>

311
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 1>How can you declare yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

312
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.340
<v Speaker 1>where no one else in the game has agreed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the rules,</v>

313
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.110
<v Speaker 1>it's arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no winning because there's no</v>

314
00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

315
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 1>companies are playing finite games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to their language.</v>

316
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.440
<v Speaker 1>They try to beat their competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that even mean?</v>

317
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:22.940
<v Speaker 1>It's the leaders and the companies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the game that they're in and</v>

318
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:26.390
<v Speaker 1>organize their resources and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision making around the infinite</v>

319
00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 1>contest that outlast and frustrate their</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

320
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 1>All the companies that we've referred to</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the exceptions,</v>

321
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 1>southwest airlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple computers,</v>

322
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Harley Davidson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the exception.</v>

323
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're playing the infinite contest.</v>

324
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.530
<v Speaker 1>They frustrate their competition is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

325
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing to win.</v>

326
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Say Jim Senegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the founder of Costco,</v>

327
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 1>which is the company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only real company that gives walmart</v>

328
00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:56.040
<v Speaker 1>or run for its money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

329
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.090
<v Speaker 1>public companies are looking to succeed</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the quarter.</v>

330
00:17:59.091 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 1>It says we're looking for the next 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

331
00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:03.240
<v Speaker 1>You could hear him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's playing the infinite contest.</v>

332
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I spoke at a leadership summit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft.</v>

333
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I also spoke at a leadership summit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple.</v>

334
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Now at the Microsoft summit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say 70 percent of the</v>

335
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:16.920
<v Speaker 1>executives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was under the Steve Ballmer</v>

336
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:19.080
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say about 70 percent of the</v>

337
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:24.081
<v Speaker 1>executives spent about 70 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their presentations talking about how to</v>

338
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 1>beat apple</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the apple summit,</v>

339
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 1>a 100 percent of the executives spend a</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent of their presentations</v>

340
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.760
<v Speaker 1>talking about how to help teachers teach</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how to help students learn.</v>

341
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.980
<v Speaker 1>One was obsessed with their competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one was obsessed with where</v>

342
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 1>they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the end of my presentation at</v>

343
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave me a gift.</v>

344
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:50.220
<v Speaker 1>They gave me the new zoom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the competitor to the ipod</v>

345
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.960
<v Speaker 1>touch when it was a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

346
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.660
<v Speaker 1>And I have to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this piece of technology was</v>

347
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.780
<v Speaker 1>spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful.</v>

348
00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.260
<v Speaker 1>The user interface was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The design was amazing.</v>

349
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.230
<v Speaker 1>It was intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one of those beautiful,</v>

350
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:07.260
<v Speaker 1>elegant pieces of technology I'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen right now.</v>

351
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 1>They didn't work with Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an entirely different problem.</v>

352
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:15.201
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something else.</v>

353
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting in the back of a taxi with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>senior apple executive,</v>

354
00:19:22.381 --> 00:19:27.381
<v Speaker 1>sort of employee number 12 kinda guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I decided to stir the pot and I</v>

355
00:19:28.381 --> 00:19:29.460
<v Speaker 1>turned to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

356
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spoke at a Microsoft summit and they</v>

357
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:37.080
<v Speaker 1>gave me their new Zune and I have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you,</v>

358
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.130
<v Speaker 1>it is so much better than your ipod</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch,</v>

359
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.870
<v Speaker 1>and he turned to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no doubt conversation over</v>

360
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:53.430
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

361
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:58.430
<v Speaker 1>the infinite player isn't playing to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one every day with every product</v>

362
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.190
<v Speaker 1>they're playing to outlast the</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

363
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.930
<v Speaker 1>If I had said to Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

364
00:20:03.931 --> 00:20:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I've got the new ipod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch it so much better than your new</v>

365
00:20:05.881 --> 00:20:06.570
<v Speaker 1>zoom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

366
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:07.680
<v Speaker 1>can we see it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it do?</v>

367
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.530
<v Speaker 1>How we have to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one is obsessed with their</v>

368
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:13.200
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is obsessed with why they do</v>

369
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:15.390
<v Speaker 1>what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other is obsessed with where they're</v>

370
00:20:15.391 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 1>going and the reason apple frustrates</v>
<v Speaker 1>their competition is because secretly</v>

371
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.630
<v Speaker 1>they're not even competing against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're competing against themselves and</v>

372
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:28.950
<v Speaker 1>they understand that sometimes you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit ahead and sometimes you're a</v>

373
00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 1>little bit behind and sometimes your</v>
<v Speaker 1>product is better and sometimes you're</v>

374
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:36.150
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you wake up every single morning</v>

375
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.080
<v Speaker 1>and compete against yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I make our products better than</v>

376
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:40.980
<v Speaker 1>they were yesterday?</v>

377
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.920
<v Speaker 1>How do I take care of our customers</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than we did yesterday?</v>

378
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.320
<v Speaker 1>How do we advance our cause more</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiently,</v>

379
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 1>more productively than we did yesterday?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we find new solutions to advance</v>

380
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.750
<v Speaker 1>our calling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our cause,</v>

381
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 1>our purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our belief,</v>

382
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.720
<v Speaker 1>our why every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you'll find is over time you will</v>

383
00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 1>probably be ahead more often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who play the infinite game</v>

384
00:21:02.921 --> 00:21:07.921
<v Speaker 1>understand it's not about the battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about the war and they don't play</v>

385
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.430
<v Speaker 1>to win every day and they frustrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>their competition until their</v>

386
00:21:12.431 --> 00:21:15.520
<v Speaker 1>competition drops out of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single bankruptcy,</v>

387
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.420
<v Speaker 1>almost every merger and acquisition is</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a company saying we no longer</v>

388
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:22.540
<v Speaker 1>have the will or the resources to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to play and we have no choice</v>

389
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:26.320
<v Speaker 1>to either drop out of the game or or</v>
<v Speaker 1>merge our resources with another player.</v>

390
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.900
<v Speaker 1>So that we can stay in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>

391
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.570
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about the number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bankruptcies and mergers and</v>

392
00:21:31.571 --> 00:21:34.750
<v Speaker 1>acquisitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of proof that most companies</v>

393
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.590
<v Speaker 1>don't even know the game they're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be a great leader,</v>

394
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 1>start with empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be a great leader,</v>

395
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.350
<v Speaker 1>change your perspective and play the</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

396
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:45.520
<v Speaker 1>You're actually playing.</v>
