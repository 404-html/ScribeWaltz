1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.123
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>and the biggest one is mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.490
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that has really become</v>

4
00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:14.570
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>the reason there's not a lot of content</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I put out between 2011 and 2014 if</v>

6
00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>you go back and look at the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because I needed to go run and build</v>

7
00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:28.370
<v Speaker 1>vayner media again for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because after writing crush it and</v>

8
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:33.371
<v Speaker 1>speaking a little bit from 2009 to 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was starting to get into a place where</v>

9
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>people were talking about me and calling</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a speaker or a motivational speaker</v>

10
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>and author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an author,</v>

11
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>which is super fine and an incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me,</v>

13
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>my pride isn't being a practitioner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being an entrepreneur and being a ceo,</v>

14
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I needed to build a nother hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollar plus business.</v>

15
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be frank with you,</v>

16
00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I need to feel comfortable standing here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and spitting my 2 cents on things.</v>

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that you need to have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>execution other than ideas to have the</v>

18
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>audacity to stand up here and expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to waste her time and money</v>

19
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 1>listening to what you have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm proud that over the last six</v>

20
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:19.190
<v Speaker 1>years I've been executing vayner media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while I do this Gary v thing,</v>

21
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Gary Vaynerchuk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CEO of $150 million holding company</v>

22
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:25.130
<v Speaker 1>from scratch is exciting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

23
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>And it really has become obvious to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>why that's happening.</v>

24
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's around mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

25
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's way too many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this audience that are in the excuse</v>

26
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

27
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

28
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's tough because I'm empathetic.</v>

29
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>There's always things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>you could have two parents that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug addicts.</v>

31
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:48.260
<v Speaker 1>You could have lost your parents in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car accident when you were a kid.</v>

32
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.620
<v Speaker 1>You could have had your money stolen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you by a partner.</v>

33
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.570
<v Speaker 1>There's so many things that happen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

34
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm super empathetic to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate problem is though,</v>

35
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 1>is that the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world doesn't care right there.</v>

36
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:07.220
<v Speaker 1>There's so much dwelling going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many reasons why not.</v>

37
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that has been really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me is that if you asked</v>

38
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:15.521
<v Speaker 1>me what works for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's optimism and gratitude and positive</v>

39
00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 1>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really interesting to me.</v>

40
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Life is pretty binary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's either black or white.</v>

41
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.170
<v Speaker 1>It's either yes or no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the one that matters to me the most</v>

42
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>is you're either on the offense in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life right now or you're on the defense.</v>

43
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.820
<v Speaker 1>You're either coming up with reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all this technology,</v>

44
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.590
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then why not?</v>

45
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Or why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

46
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>all this technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>

47
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:43.610
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at things and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a decision.</v>

48
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what I've been thinking about</v>

49
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:48.620
<v Speaker 1>is mindset and why optimism works.</v>

50
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Literally seven minutes ago in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the green room,</v>

51
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the phone with executives at</v>
<v Speaker 1>vayner media.</v>

52
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting texts of a scope that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect it to sign.</v>

53
00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Failed million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally counting out $1 million gone.</v>

54
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Zero not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

55
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Another pitch we went to final to $8</v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

56
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>didn't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally in 47 second step back in the</v>

57
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>back room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost $9 million</v>

58
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>and I'll be very frank with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking pumped about it.</v>

59
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely like losing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like learning from it.</v>

60
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I was like thinking about like why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened,</v>

61
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>where we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it was,</v>

62
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>the MISSTEP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

63
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really incredible and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can afford to lose it.</v>

64
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure people are thinking is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

65
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I lost 9 million beaner</v>

66
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>9 million revenue,</v>

67
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>but to me it's not about anything other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than mindset.</v>

68
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>And so if I got anything out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go into the tactics.</v>

69
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk to you about social in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

70
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to tell you why facebook and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instagram,</v>

71
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a lot of homework on Saturday about</v>

72
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>the Australian market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On my thesis is around influencers,</v>

73
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

74
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>and snapchat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me save you a lot of time.</v>

75
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Everything that you've been hearing me</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>

76
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 1>how many people here are consumed my</v>
<v Speaker 1>content?</v>

77
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

78
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:59.080
<v Speaker 1>That was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just going to do that again.</v>

79
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>How many people here are consuming</v>
<v Speaker 1>content?</v>

80
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>So here's what's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally everything that I'm spitting</v>

81
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>comes obviously from an American centric</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view.</v>

82
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>That's where I operate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we have a UK office,</v>

83
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing other things,</v>

84
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 1>but I'm aware that outside of Russia and</v>
<v Speaker 1>men mainly and shine them most,</v>

85
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>most of the stuff that actually works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a couple of different</v>

86
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>nuances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What fascinates the shit out of me is</v>

87
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>the consumption patterns of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australian and New Zealand market and</v>

88
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>the underpriced nature extremities of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I believe in.</v>

89
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Literally everything that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about for the last year,</v>

90
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>you can add a additional 20 to 40% tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>of upside.</v>

91
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>It is literally 20 to 40% even better in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this market.</v>

92
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>And I get so pissed when people are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any police besides the u s market or</v>

93
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 1>China where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

94
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a smaller market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

95
00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 1>that and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where all the upside is.</v>

96
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.690
<v Speaker 1>You can only compete against what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can compete against.</v>

97
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I believe that we are living</v>

98
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 1>through the greatest era to be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur ever.</v>

99
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I think the Internet is grossly</v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimated and I think there's a ton</v>

100
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 1>of opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you asked me what I would want to</v>

101
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:13.200
<v Speaker 1>leave with from this talk today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to shift one or two persons</v>

102
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>mindsets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

103
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:19.621
<v Speaker 1>To me it's an incredible feeling to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up here and expect nothing from</v>

104
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>nobody and take full responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

105
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.830
<v Speaker 1>I the Teleco company that gave it to us</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we lost it and weed in the backroom,</v>

106
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>the 8 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent zero days in,</v>

107
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>zero seconds on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not part of the pitch.</v>

108
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I was not part of the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I empowered on my people.</v>

109
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.100
<v Speaker 1>I saw the news in the back room and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>took full 100% blame and responsibility.</v>

110
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I am fascinated by your upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both your parents and the neighborhood</v>

111
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:53.131
<v Speaker 1>and those siblings and the friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am fascinated by your upbringing,</v>

112
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.500
<v Speaker 1>the era you grew up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the macro and micro that you grew up in,</v>

113
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>not the fucking weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the economics and the politics</v>

114
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
<v Speaker 1>and that climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated what made me my mom,</v>

115
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>my dad being an immigrant from Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in America,</v>

116
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>being in Jersey like like the friends I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran into,</v>

117
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 1>baseball cards becoming popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing me to sell something.</v>

118
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated the environment that</v>
<v Speaker 1>created me in this completely emotional</v>

119
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>place of enormous strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the engine and the oxygen that</v>

120
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:30.101
<v Speaker 1>allows me to be successful in business</v>
<v Speaker 1>and life and then what is it that other</v>

121
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>people don't have or didn't have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see it.</v>

122
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I see how my grandmother parented my</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad.</v>

123
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I see my sisters and brothers DNA</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than mine.</v>

124
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just timing and things of that nature.</v>

125
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going heady for my opening</v>
<v Speaker 1>spot because I need you to understand</v>

126
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>too many of you are going to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking notes right now and think it's</v>

127
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Speaker 1>about a facebook ad to many of you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>about to take a note and be like,</v>

128
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google how to use instagram influencers.</v>

129
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>We'll get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to talk about that.</v>

130
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.620
<v Speaker 1>But if your foundation isn't right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no shot of longterm success.</v>

131
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>If you're not in a place where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe this and look,</v>

132
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>this is super like I'm even like</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing up on my,</v>

133
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>to be very frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's happening in my head.</v>

134
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to what I'm seeing right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

135
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking sucks.</v>

136
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm being serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being really fucking serious with</v>

137
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 1>you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm seeing that because I'm like,</v>

138
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:20.520
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so hot.</v>

139
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>What I'm talking about is like so hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like touch,</v>

140
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's still my truth.</v>

141
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 1>It's what I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're either on the offense or</v>

142
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:32.780
<v Speaker 1>you're on the defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either see all these technologies as</v>

143
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 1>the gateway drug to your entire future</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're upset that it was much easier</v>

144
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 1>to do this on email and seo and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like this social media thing,</v>

145
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like these new things either.</v>

146
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I built my dad's business from a three</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a $60 million business on email and</v>

147
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Google ad words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want youtube to come along.</v>

148
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want twitter to come along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

149
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want facebook to come along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want snapchat to come along.</v>

150
00:07:56.061 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a voice and Alexa skills</v>
<v Speaker 1>and podcast to come along.</v>

151
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:05.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking forward to Vr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is technology and the way we</v>

152
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 1>live doesn't care about my opinion or my</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

153
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't care about yours either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can walk around earth and</v>

154
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

155
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:17.990
<v Speaker 1>it's so sad that all these kids can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate because they're on the phone</v>

156
00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can walk out tonight and have</v>

157
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>dinner and see people at a table and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's talking to each other and</v>

158
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 1>they're all on the phone and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>judging.</v>

159
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.080
<v Speaker 1>And you could talk about a day and age</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was simpler and nicer and all</v>

160
00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>

161
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't adjust to the reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the situation,</v>

162
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 1>you will be completely left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>

163
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Too many people are executing or hoping</v>
<v Speaker 1>or trying to figure out how to live in a</v>

164
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:51.491
<v Speaker 1>world that used to be or the way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wish it was versus attacking the reality</v>

165
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here is the reality of the world.</v>

166
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 1>My friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cell phones that you're all holding</v>

167
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>right now or in your pocket or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>remote controls of our society,</v>

168
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 1>they are the single most important thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

169
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally,</v>

170
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather have somebody roll up on</v>

171
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 1>me right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stab me with a knife and steal my wallet</v>

172
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 1>than lose my phone.</v>

173
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.200
<v Speaker 1>The world is being lived through that</v>
<v Speaker 1>device and you can judge it.</v>

174
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.960
<v Speaker 1>You can do anything you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the reality and if you sit</v>

175
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>here today and have any ambitions</v>
<v Speaker 1>professionally,</v>

176
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:29.940
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you want to sell a course,</v>

177
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 1>whether you want to sell a sneaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you want to raise money for the</v>

178
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:37.911
<v Speaker 1>PTA or nonprofit gets somebody elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to happen in life,</v>

179
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to happen in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you first need somebody's attention and</v>

180
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 1>then you need to tell them about it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the written word,</v>

181
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 1>in audio or video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how the world works and always</v>

182
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want something to happen.</v>

183
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.010
<v Speaker 1>You need to figure out where the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are to tell them about that thing and</v>

184
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 1>then you need to communicate that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

185
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.710
<v Speaker 1>In a compelling enough way that they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that you want them to do.</v>

186
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>You can do that in the written word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that in audio and you can do</v>

187
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:11.370
<v Speaker 1>that in video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is how it's been.</v>

188
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>It was called the newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the television and the radio.</v>

189
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Now it's called a blog of blog or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

190
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's changed except one thing.</v>

191
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Your attention is moving to a new place</v>
<v Speaker 1>and leaving an old place.</v>

192
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.320
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is we have not figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the creative strategies to be</v>

193
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:34.500
<v Speaker 1>successful in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is there's a lot of</v>

194
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:38.460
<v Speaker 1>people in here who are not self aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't realize they should only be</v>

195
00:10:38.461 --> 00:10:43.461
<v Speaker 1>writing and not making videos because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not good at it or reversed or</v>

196
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:47.370
<v Speaker 1>reverse these blanket statements that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody needs a personal brand or</v>

197
00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 1>everybody should be doing video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is ludicrous.</v>

198
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 1>What everybody should be doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>deploying self awareness and figuring</v>

199
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 1>out who they are.</v>

200
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Quadrupled Downing on what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking good at and trying to get</v>

201
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:00.750
<v Speaker 1>resources to support the stuff they suck</v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

202
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I've written four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

203
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.710
<v Speaker 1>I've written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

204
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I've written for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.050
<v Speaker 1>when she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's written for New York Times best</v>

206
00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 1>selling books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally was laughing as I was about</v>

207
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 1>to get to the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

208
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.480
<v Speaker 1>I can't put two fucking sentences</v>
<v Speaker 1>together if my life depended on it,</v>

209
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.670
<v Speaker 1>but I know how to hire a ghost writer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I definitely know how to sit down</v>

210
00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:24.000
<v Speaker 1>for nine hours straight and record a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book in one fucking sitting.</v>

211
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to figure out how you</v>

212
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:31.950
<v Speaker 1>communicate to the world as an executer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which medium.</v>

213
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Some of you could do all three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some can do too,</v>

214
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>but watch what's been happening over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last 10 years.</v>

215
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 1>In 2000 or 15 in 2002 to four it was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>era of the blog.</v>

216
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.550
<v Speaker 1>It was bloggers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people here were a blogger from</v>

217
00:11:44.551 --> 00:11:46.920
<v Speaker 1>2002 to 2005 at any point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise your hands.</v>

218
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 1>So some of these early piners like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt the impact,</v>

219
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:51.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

220
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.260
<v Speaker 1>You were blogging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

221
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 1>That was the medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wordpress or you know,</v>

222
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 1>even going back further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was just a very important</v>

223
00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 1>medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube had been yet to be invented.</v>

224
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it costs too much to stream video</v>

225
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:04.570
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no video players.</v>

226
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Podcasting then came in 2005 and six had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little blip,</v>

227
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.800
<v Speaker 1>but then write quickly after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter came out,</v>

228
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.300
<v Speaker 1>youtube came out and everything shifted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to short form writing and video,</v>

229
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in the last two years,</v>

230
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 1>audio has risen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people here now listen to a</v>

231
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:24.130
<v Speaker 1>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hands.</v>

232
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Speaker 1>How many of those hands did not listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a podcast three years ago?</v>

233
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold them up.</v>

234
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:30.611
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

235
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Watch this for visual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna do this one more time.</v>

236
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 1>How many people watched how many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are listening to a podcast now?</v>

237
00:12:36.851 --> 00:12:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want people in the front to look</v>

238
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See what I see?</v>

239
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an insane amount.</v>

240
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Now of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people that now listen to a</v>

241
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:49.120
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up.</v>

242
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 1>If you did not listen to a podcast three</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago</v>

243
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.510
<v Speaker 1>and you'd be look around because if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to understand why I'm standing on</v>

244
00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:04.960
<v Speaker 1>this stage right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say sit down.</v>

245
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.741
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get him,</v>

246
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:06.574
<v Speaker 1>get him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a kitty cat</v>

247
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:14.190
<v Speaker 1>if you want to understand why I'm so</v>
<v Speaker 1>blessed to sit on the stage is I have a</v>

248
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:17.650
<v Speaker 1>unique uncanny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take no credit.</v>

249
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:21.280
<v Speaker 1>My parents get all the credit ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly understand what you're about to</v>

250
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 1>do before you think you're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

251
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.500
<v Speaker 1>And so what I do is when I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's coming,</v>

252
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I have humility and this is a word that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love for people to look up,</v>

253
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.650
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and start really becoming religious</v>

254
00:13:35.651 --> 00:13:40.270
<v Speaker 1>about for all my ego and peacocking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the ones in here who've been paying</v>

255
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is my humility that has allowed me to</v>

256
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:46.090
<v Speaker 1>be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in the way that I interact with you</v>

257
00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 1>and being kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's kindness in the humility</v>

258
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:51.610
<v Speaker 1>that when I believe something new is</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging,</v>

259
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I take the perceived risk of going there</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

260
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.470
<v Speaker 1>spending countless hours with no clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roi in the short you,</v>

261
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:06.520
<v Speaker 1>many people in here have left ungodly</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money because when social</v>

262
00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:07.331
<v Speaker 1>came along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

263
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the Roi of facebook and twitter?</v>
