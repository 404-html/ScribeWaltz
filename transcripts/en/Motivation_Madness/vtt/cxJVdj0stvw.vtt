<v Speaker 1>discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss about the dreams.</v>

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>I think like any kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of dreams when I young and</v>

18
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:06.100
<v Speaker 1>most of the dreams never came true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I've been trying to,</v>

19
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I tried the vape now when I'm 53 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

20
00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working very,</v>

21
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:16.630
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely hard in the pastor 30 years,</v>

22
00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>35 years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's time to think about my</v>

23
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:26.521
<v Speaker 1>young childhood dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sing songs and being an actor and</v>

24
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 1>painting everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to try everything that I go.</v>

25
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.610
<v Speaker 1>So you have to work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can realize a lot of dreams.</v>

26
00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Speaker 1>That sounded stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy when you were young.</v>

27
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

28
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Let me say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started out,</v>

29
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

30
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:48.151
<v Speaker 1>I said I worked very hard when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>student at university in the university</v>

31
00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:50.740
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the chairman of the student's</v>

32
00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Union of my university and a for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

33
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.233
<v Speaker 1>I spent,</v>

34
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 1>I would say 70% of my time serving in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the student's unit,</v>

35
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>supporting young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gives me a lot of lot of experience</v>

36
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>that working with the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people relationship,</v>

37
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>helping people by helping people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can a lot of fun and get out.</v>

38
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>When I get them all fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I help you more people.</v>

39
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 1>So this is why when I never got an even</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day of training to do business,</v>

40
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.010
<v Speaker 1>when I stepped my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my company,</v>

41
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.190
<v Speaker 1>I know how to do with the other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not only knowledge that as a</v>

42
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:35.630
<v Speaker 1>student they should alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should learn how to serve people,</v>

43
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>how to work with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to team up with the people.</v>

44
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>So in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember one thing that we know Iq,</v>

45
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be successful to have</v>

47
00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:54.734
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

48
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.530
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how smart you are,</v>

49
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>but you never know how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to work with people,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We never can.</v>

51
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.771
<v Speaker 1>It's just the old dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I cue is a make you not make</v>

52
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>stupid mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't make you live longer.</v>

53
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be respected,</v>

54
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>you should have l.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Q.</v>

55
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.010
<v Speaker 1>The Q of Love is also very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are the things when you have</v>

56
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>these skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he eeq Iq and El Que,</v>

57
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>most of the students pay streamline</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the ICU,</v>

58
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>but they don't pay attention to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>queue.</v>

59
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have the El Que,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll go nowhere.</v>

60
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>So all the dreams you have the based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

61
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>And I never know that I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>

62
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I will be jumping to the internet time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I jumped in the Internet time</v>

63
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>when I started my career are the 1995 I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started Internet China and terrible</v>

64
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>years for four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a lot of mistakes and you know,</v>

65
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.540
<v Speaker 1>stupid mistakes and partner and all in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

66
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a railway.</v>

67
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.750
<v Speaker 1>1999 was when I started Alibaba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my team that we may not succeed,</v>

68
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>but somebody will.</v>

69
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.880
<v Speaker 1>And I never know and we never realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>after 18 years we can achieve them much.</v>

70
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>So if it is your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dream,</v>

71
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.850
<v Speaker 1>you can never go for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it is a group stream can go further.</v>

72
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.470
<v Speaker 1>So I make our Alibaba dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not my dream is a dream of 18 founders.</v>

73
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Later it become a dream today become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream of 60,000 people.</v>

74
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.980
<v Speaker 1>And we make the dream tribe and making</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that everybody we will try.</v>

75
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Our dream is to enable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody can realize the intrepreneur</v>

76
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 1>dreams through the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So young people remember,</v>

77
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a silly dream?</v>

79
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Now if you really believe it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great dream.</v>

80
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>So believe something that you're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>passionate about.</v>

81
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe it because the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think it is important.</v>

82
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I never think when most people like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it when most people don't</v>

83
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>

84
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I will think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is that you'll make yourself</v>

85
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 1>unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are you and doing business is about</v>

86
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 1>do anything is that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are so unique,</v>

87
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>there are about 7 billion people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

88
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>but there's only one you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we see.</v>

89
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>So doctor Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of young people and a lot of</v>

90
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>students have a harder time sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sticking to their dreams.</v>

91
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>So after one field glass or one field</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting audition,</v>

92
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>they immediately get discouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what advice can you give the young</v>

93
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>people so that they can continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>sticking towards their dream even in</v>

94
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>spite of all the obstacles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>One thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why have a dream?</v>

96
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>You have the same one in the treme is</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

97
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>The thing behind the dream is tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

98
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 1>So when you want to dreams that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask yourself,</v>

99
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.840
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to sacrifice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Say I want to do anything to get my</v>

100
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:24.580
<v Speaker 1>train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

101
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>What are the things you want really want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do?</v>

102
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>You have a failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are mistakes people don't like you.</v>

103
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>People don't team with you and all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuffs.</v>

104
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.930
<v Speaker 1>When you have a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think the backside of the</v>

105
00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:40.080
<v Speaker 1>trim very clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody,</v>

106
00:06:40.081 --> 00:06:41.730
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you have</v>

107
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you want?</v>

108
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 1>A very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will you give up?</v>

109
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think about what we give</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

110
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 1>you will not have what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

111
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 1>when I start my business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Internet,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Internet in China will happen.</v>

113
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:10.450
<v Speaker 1>So I want to sell my products.</v>

<v Speaker 1>nobody helping me.</v>

118
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People should help you.</v>

119
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 1>People will help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is extremely,</v>

120
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:30.800
<v Speaker 1>you're lucky people don't help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very common.</v>

121
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.170
<v Speaker 1>So when you go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

122
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 1>nobody would have a deal with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

123
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right.</v>

124
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Nobody do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got one deal,</v>

125
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 1>you should be honored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely happy because you are extra</v>

126
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>ordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't be discouraged when people</v>

127
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 1>don't help for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why people should help you.</v>

128
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 1>You should have earned the right to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>helped,</v>

129
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is so when you have a dream,</v>

130
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 1>you have asked what are the things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to pay for the trees?</v>

131
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.190
<v Speaker 3>So that's a very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

132
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.880
<v Speaker 3>a doctor really understanding what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're willing to give up.</v>

133
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.680
<v Speaker 3>Now we want to talk about this role</v>
<v Speaker 3>model that you've always often talked</v>

134
00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:13.590
<v Speaker 3>them rather often talked about in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your interviews,</v>

135
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 3>forest gump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

136
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.170
<v Speaker 3>often times you cite this coat from</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

137
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.260
<v Speaker 3>from that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is a box of chocolates.</v>

138
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with that we wanted to know more</v>

139
00:08:26.161 --> 00:08:30.150
<v Speaker 3>about how you stumbled upon forrest gump</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what kind of,</v>

140
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.540
<v Speaker 3>what kind of different perspective in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

141
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has watching that movie,</v>

142
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>given to you?</v>

143
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very interesting question.</v>

144
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.980
<v Speaker 1>The day I watched the forrest gump was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a friend's home in Seattle and that</v>

145
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:54.210
<v Speaker 1>week was my most frustrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just made period.</v>

146
00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 1>I was so upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was cheated by my friends and I failed</v>

147
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>like five projects all film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I almost to say,</v>

148
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

149
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people I work with,</v>

150
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:12.230
<v Speaker 1>they're very smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

151
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 1>we know that Internet was not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 95,</v>

152
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 1>90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>96,</v>

153
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.150
<v Speaker 1>907.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when we,</v>

154
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.220
<v Speaker 1>we did not realize it's so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was happy to be in Seattle,</v>

155
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>in my friend's home and he had a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forrest gump of watch that,</v>

156
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 1>that evening and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the movie.</v>

157
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to stay foolish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw a dream.</v>

158
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Don't think we are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to stay foolish with their</v>

159
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have to continue be simple.</v>

160
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Like forrest gump is a very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not smart guy.</v>

161
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 1>He continued to do running round money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks that the sub,</v>

162
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.200
<v Speaker 1>he said nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.080
<v Speaker 1>he will only want to make business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bennett from the catcher shrinks.</v>

164
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.450
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people want to make business</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make money by catch wills,</v>

165
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.540
<v Speaker 1>shocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 1>you've got to do business who was a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

167
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

168
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:14.280
<v Speaker 1>he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should serve normal people.</v>

169
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.800
<v Speaker 1>We should catch shrimps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should have supporting small</v>

170
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So be simple,</v>

171
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 1>stay foolish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no matter what,</v>

172
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the continuum and do not complain.</v>

173
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Others only complete yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Checking what's the problem was me,</v>

174
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.360
<v Speaker 1>did I change myself late?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fall.</v>

175
00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people feel because when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel they always complain about the</v>

176
00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

177
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 1>that's his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that problem,</v>

178
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:44.154
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem.</v>

179
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 1>And only those people always check their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own problems.</v>

180
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.810
<v Speaker 1>These people survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people succeed.</v>

181
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Four years for Pi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age,</v>

182
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 1>18 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Ali Baba me complaint a</v>

183
00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:02.580
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you complain,</v>

184
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's no solution for complain,</v>

185
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.570
<v Speaker 1>don't complain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

186
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 4>So in the movie forrest Gump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you talked about the shrimp,</v>

187
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:17.250
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were basically days before they</v>

188
00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:21.660
<v Speaker 4>finally got that big hall of shrimp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So forrest had to go through a lot of</v>

189
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 4>failure before he got success.</v>
<v Speaker 4>With that,</v>

190
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 4>you've already said the young people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they should be able to learn more</v>

191
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.420
<v Speaker 4>from their failures rather than their</v>
<v Speaker 4>successes.</v>

192
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:35.220
<v Speaker 4>What do you think the types of failures</v>
<v Speaker 4>young people make that they should learn</v>

193
00:11:35.221 --> 00:11:36.054
<v Speaker 4>the most from?</v>

194
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you that one day I was a</v>

195
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.270
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

196
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Reading a biography of general in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up the Second World War</v>

197
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 1>and I feel impressed not</v>

198
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.580
<v Speaker 2>is how much victories successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better that he achieved.</v>

199
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

200
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I were better,</v>

201
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 2>if I were John Young man at that time I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could do better.</v>

202
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.970
<v Speaker 2>But I was impressed by how many suffers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that terrible experience that he</v>

203
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 2>survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's surprised me.</v>

204
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.940
<v Speaker 2>The grant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grand grandfather always tell us,</v>

205
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack,</v>

206
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a lot of mistakes.</v>

207
00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:25.540
<v Speaker 2>I still surviving as a wall that if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

208
00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:27.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I been achieved that much and say,</v>

209
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:29.100
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

210
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 2>if I were your age though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that time I could do better.</v>

211
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 2>So people were few proud when the day</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you tell your grandson about how</v>

212
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:43.321
<v Speaker 2>much tough days you have gone through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one day I share with my kids,</v>

213
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:49.621
<v Speaker 2>my grandchildren,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much Ali Baba have gone through the</v>

214
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 2>tough days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mistakes doing business.</v>

215
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a go to the battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the survivor wings.</v>

216
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 2>No matter how brief you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your dad,</v>

217
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.280
<v Speaker 2>people forget or you within three days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

218
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.450
<v Speaker 1>but if you survive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always have chance and go to battle.</v>

219
00:13:12.451 --> 00:13:17.451
<v Speaker 1>Feud is that I experienced the soldier</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that are held to hit a himself and</v>

220
00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:24.270
<v Speaker 1>then fight young soldiers just to go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight.</v>

221
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.040
<v Speaker 1>There are a gift from the reasons for</v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

222
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.730
<v Speaker 1>There are various reasons too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one person to be successful,</v>

223
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:37.830
<v Speaker 1>but there are almost the same reasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people who feel greedy,</v>

224
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:43.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Round team round too fast with too much</v>

225
00:13:44.071 --> 00:13:45.150
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

226
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you will never make big mistakes where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have money,</v>

227
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.450
<v Speaker 1>but people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have the money,</v>

228
00:13:51.451 --> 00:13:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do a big business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

229
00:13:53.281 --> 00:13:54.114
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

230
00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the mistakes the other people made</v>

231
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.520
<v Speaker 1>you will make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to learn.</v>

232
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.530
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn the mistakes the other people</v>

233
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.840
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn from the mistake the other people</v>

234
00:14:12.841 --> 00:14:17.841
<v Speaker 1>may not because you will avoid these</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes because you know how to face</v>

235
00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 1>these mistakes and troubles when these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things come</v>

236
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.410
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you serve a lot of our mistakes,</v>

237
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.040
<v Speaker 1>we see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

238
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.140
<v Speaker 1>these guys coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these mystic come how the Jack Ma did a</v>

239
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.640
<v Speaker 1>how bill gates did it or how a Bama did</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

240
00:14:32.641 --> 00:14:35.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the tough day comes is it's not</v>

241
00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:38.520
<v Speaker 1>because you can't avoid it because when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem comes,</v>

242
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.120
<v Speaker 1>how your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was great attitude,</v>

243
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.193
<v Speaker 1>then you succeed.</v>

244
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:44.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

245
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm doctor are there than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

246
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I think one time you also mentioned that</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving</v>

247
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 3>up is possibly one of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 3>failures that the other person can do.</v>

248
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.580
<v Speaker 3>But I think when it comes to the young</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

249
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.700
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes you have our crazy dreams and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we tried to seek advice from older</v>

250
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:08.130
<v Speaker 3>people or more experienced people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes tell us that's not going to</v>

251
00:15:08.131 --> 00:15:13.131
<v Speaker 3>work or this is how you make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we make it happen such that we</v>

252
00:15:14.061 --> 00:15:18.140
<v Speaker 3>still continue our dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time we take criticism.</v>

253
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't give up because more often</v>

254
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:22.870
<v Speaker 3>than not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened.</v>

255
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.990
<v Speaker 1>If you have a crazy dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't talk to her grandfather.</v>

256
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a crazy dream,</v>

257
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.330
<v Speaker 1>very important is that you have to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people around you.</v>

258
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.260
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we invest a company,</v>

259
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.670
<v Speaker 1>I want not all looking at the founder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the people who work with</v>

260
00:15:48.671 --> 00:15:50.290
<v Speaker 1>the founder of whether did you believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

261
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.580
<v Speaker 1>If he is the only person that believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dream,</v>

262
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.490
<v Speaker 1>that's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a crazy dream is a crazy</v>

263
00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:04.870
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have to find a group of people</v>

264
00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:06.910
<v Speaker 1>who are all believed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all crazy.</v>

265
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Something interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

266
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's easier to make a work person</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

267
00:16:12.251 --> 00:16:16.300
<v Speaker 1>But if you make it the whole team crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something interesting.</v>

268
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.940
<v Speaker 1>This is what I did.</v>

269
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Early days of Alibaba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a speech in America talk about</v>

270
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:30.761
<v Speaker 1>the value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission and management way of running an</v>

271
00:16:31.221 --> 00:16:34.750
<v Speaker 1>internet company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was very early 2001,</v>

272
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.590
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a guy in American guys sitting</v>

273
00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:37.280
<v Speaker 1>there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

274
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.170
<v Speaker 1>this is a crazy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet at the survivors to make profit</v>

275
00:16:42.171 --> 00:16:45.470
<v Speaker 1>or revenue for Gabba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carnival Valley imaging and team</v>

276
00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this is old.</v>

277
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 1>This is old liars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

278
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:50.180
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

279
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to Ali Baba someday.</v>

280
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.270
<v Speaker 1>So he came to Ali Baba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend a few days.</v>

281
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:57.860
<v Speaker 1>The day when he left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

282
00:16:57.861 --> 00:16:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you are crazy.</v>

283
00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Now I found a 100 crazy guys and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>company</v>

284
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.070
<v Speaker 1>because we believe what we are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

285
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 1>it's easiest to make you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you can make a group of team</v>

286
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:15.521
<v Speaker 1>belief and continued to do it dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think</v>

287
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.680
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's crazy or not,</v>

288
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:24.820
<v Speaker 1>the only testing is the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to make a company is sounds</v>

289
00:17:24.821 --> 00:17:26.800
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're customer love it.</v>

290
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.540
<v Speaker 1>If the custom like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your team like it,</v>

291
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.860
<v Speaker 1>you know it's not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the customer does not like it,</v>

292
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.960
<v Speaker 1>do not like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your team don't like it,</v>

293
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.810
<v Speaker 1>forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to change yourself,</v>

294
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.420
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you have a crease,</v>

295
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:48.430
<v Speaker 1>ideas don't believe you're always right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn all the by.</v>

296
00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:53.761
<v Speaker 1>By the past 18 years we have changed at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least the 18 big major changes.</v>

297
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.710
<v Speaker 1>We are not the Ali Baba last a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every week,</v>

298
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.100
<v Speaker 1>every year we have different company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

299
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

300
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you have to change all the time to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that we don't care about how the</v>

301
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 1>other people say you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We care about is this something really</v>

302
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.400
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really make the,</v>

303
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.560
<v Speaker 1>make the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we care about.</v>

304
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of the students here are young</v>
<v Speaker 4>entrepreneurs themselves and they have a</v>

305
00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:24.510
<v Speaker 4>lot of crazy ideas and they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make those ideas happen.</v>

306
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 4>Since you're the UNC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that special advisor for young</v>

307
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:31.770
<v Speaker 4>entrepreneurship and small businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think the role of young</v>

308
00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 4>entrepreneurs and small businesses are</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the country and had making the</v>

309
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:36.024
<v Speaker 4>country grow?</v>
<v Speaker 4>True?</v>

310
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Good way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to do it.</v>

311
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:45.080
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I advise give is think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what will you give up,</v>

312
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And next thing I want to give advisors</v>

313
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.920
<v Speaker 1>how many years you want to reach for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goal.</v>

314
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.900
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be 16 next month or next year</v>

315
00:18:56.901 --> 00:18:58.650
<v Speaker 1>or next two week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about,</v>

316
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.900
<v Speaker 1>there's no such opportunity in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that you can succeed next week.</v>

317
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.990
<v Speaker 1>There's no better opportunity that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit next to year cause young people,</v>

318
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.480
<v Speaker 1>most people like the main,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

319
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.880
<v Speaker 1>18 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have money,</v>

320
00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:15.650
<v Speaker 1>we don't have technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a relationship,</v>

321
00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:18.530
<v Speaker 1>we don't have any powerful person</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting us.</v>

322
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I started my business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 people.</v>

323
00:19:22.941 --> 00:19:27.941
<v Speaker 1>We only get the 50,000 US dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 people together in my apartment so we</v>

324
00:19:30.651 --> 00:19:32.940
<v Speaker 1>don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I started Alibaba,</v>

325
00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.480
<v Speaker 1>when I started my internet business</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

<v Speaker 1>1995 I started with 2000 he has</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughters.</v>

<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

328
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I was started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know one thing people like us</v>

329
00:19:46.971 --> 00:19:48.600

<v Speaker 1>Technology,</v>

330
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.770
<v Speaker 1>don't have any relationship or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

331
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.980
<v Speaker 1>We know we wink for the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know if I,</v>

332
00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.880
<v Speaker 1>I started doing it 10 years later we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>win and in the 10 years what I would</v>

333
00:20:01.821 --> 00:20:03.950
<v Speaker 1>give up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who our partner was,</v>

334
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 1>what the things will be different than</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

335
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.920
<v Speaker 1>how can I live longer at instead of live</v>
<v Speaker 1>happier.</v>

336
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.220
<v Speaker 1>So the world is very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to live happier,</v>

337
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.820
<v Speaker 1>you may live very shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we want to live longer,</v>

338
00:20:16.821 --> 00:20:18.170
<v Speaker 1>life is a bit good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tough.</v>

339
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.670
<v Speaker 1>You have to exercise every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

340
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.400
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the live balance.</v>

341
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.070
<v Speaker 1>So young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a dream you want to do is</v>

342
00:20:28.071 --> 00:20:31.490
<v Speaker 1>think about how many years you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make this thing happen.</v>

343
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.570
<v Speaker 1>If you think it's about three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can be successful per pair for 10</v>

344
00:20:35.571 --> 00:20:39.020
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think I have five years to</v>

345
00:20:39.021 --> 00:20:42.770
<v Speaker 1>succeed for Pepo 15 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

346

<v Speaker 1>Ms Succeed in eight years.</v>

347
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:52.650
<v Speaker 1>So you should have a long preparation</v>
<v Speaker 1>determination and these all the things</v>

348

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

367
00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.410
<v Speaker 5>Doctor Jack Reservoir La.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to think,</v>

368
00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:51.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

369
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.810
<v Speaker 5>Doctor Jack for an insightful discussion</v>
<v Speaker 5>earlier.</v>

370
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.440
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about a framework that</v>

371
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.160
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing with the government for</v>
<v Speaker 5>the past so many years,</v>

372
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.490
<v Speaker 5>which focuses on money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

373
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 5>mentorship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>money and market,</v>

374
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.440
<v Speaker 5>the three most powerful ms in really</v>
<v Speaker 5>helping our micro and small</v>

375
00:22:13.511 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 5>entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

376
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.820
<v Speaker 5>I invited about 50 entrepreneurs here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of them from the brick and mortar</v>

377
00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:24.490
<v Speaker 5>business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A number of them are in the digital</v>

378
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 5>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three of them are quite successful and</v>

379
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:30.070
<v Speaker 5>they will share their insights and</v>
<v Speaker 5>questions with you.</v>

380
00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.790
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the brick and mortar are here</v>

381
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:37.210
<v Speaker 5>because they're scared of the changing</v>
<v Speaker 5>landscape,</v>

382
00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.800
<v Speaker 5>the structure that is happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>way things are happening.</v>

383
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.250
<v Speaker 5>So I wanted to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

384
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.080
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

385
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:52.080
<v Speaker 5>During the old economy or the brick and</v>
<v Speaker 5>mortar businesses have to fear that</v>

386
00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:56.650
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is their solution to preventing</v>

387
00:22:56.651 --> 00:22:59.020
<v Speaker 5>themselves from disappearing?</v>

388
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

389
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

390
00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:04.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old economy should not fear,</v>

391
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.890
<v Speaker 1>but they should have it</v>

392
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.170
<v Speaker 2>change immediately.</v>

393
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:14.340
<v Speaker 1>The past 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet technology changed the world.</v>

394
00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:19.820
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will speed up next 30 years and every</v>

395
00:23:20.161 --> 00:23:22.620
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like a 30 years.</v>

396
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:28.850
<v Speaker 1>So if you do not stop the change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be tough.</v>

397
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.140
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scaring people because I've been</v>

398
00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:41.291
<v Speaker 1>doing that in China for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Telling people that the new business</v>

399
00:23:41.331 --> 00:23:44.660
<v Speaker 1>motto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how it just like the older days,</v>

400
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.870
<v Speaker 1>if you using horses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

401
00:23:47.871 --> 00:23:50.960
<v Speaker 1>buffaloes too and the other guy use</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity,</v>

402
00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 1>you don't have channels at all.</v>

403
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
<v Speaker 1>If you are doing business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think about idesign and I make an</v>

404
00:24:00.161 --> 00:24:01.170
<v Speaker 1>eye cell called a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

405
00:24:01.171 --> 00:24:03.460
<v Speaker 1>two c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other guys,</v>

406
00:24:03.461 --> 00:24:07.890
<v Speaker 1>because the new technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become consumer to b consumer to</v>

407
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.860
<v Speaker 1>eat becomes CTB.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become a tailor made.</v>

408
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:15.520
<v Speaker 1>They use using the logistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a social justice to network.</v>

409
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.640
<v Speaker 1>They're reached the market a quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster than you are not.</v>

410
00:24:18.641 --> 00:24:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh they using the Internet to find the</v>
<v Speaker 1>customers abroad.</v>

411
00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Cross the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They using data technology much cheaper.</v>

412
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:34.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't have chance to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think</v>

413
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:40.860
<v Speaker 1>please change quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a competitor killing you.</v>

414
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill you</v>

415
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.180
<v Speaker 1>if you kill yourself and how you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

416
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.160
<v Speaker 1>embrace the change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not be scared about technology.</v>

417
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume today is so simple and</v>

418
00:24:59.081 --> 00:25:01.350
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing spent a time on that.</v>

419
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I think because you're an entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smart enough.</v>

420
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.650
<v Speaker 1>If you really sit down together for</v>
<v Speaker 1>three hours deep learning,</v>

421
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.050
<v Speaker 1>it would change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people just don't like it.</v>

422
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.680
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the world is so deep.</v>

423
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.170
<v Speaker 1>This world is so difficult to change a</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful people.</v>

424
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.430
<v Speaker 1>That's what people have a millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to tell you.</v>

425
00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I succeed yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you guys again,</v>

426
00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:28.810
<v Speaker 1>so let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us love from young people</v>

427
00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.580
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology,</v>

428
00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Internet technology as so simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so easy.</v>

429
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.270
<v Speaker 1>And most of the Internet companies like</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

430
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:42.840
<v Speaker 1>we give them free technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free services.</v>

431
00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Why not try free young people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we try free to succeed.</v>

432
00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.750
<v Speaker 1>So I would say don't be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be feared.</v>

433
00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Fear just to go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't use it,</v>

434
00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.830
<v Speaker 1>it's just like last century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You refuse to use electricity.</v>

435
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.260
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

436
00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.060
<v Speaker 1>it only takes about first to three</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

437
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.740
<v Speaker 1>You are totally different.</v>

438
00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.500
<v Speaker 5>We talked about the three M's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the three M's was mentorship.</v>

439
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:24.180
<v Speaker 5>Lasalle is a great school,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a great one to preschool.</v>

440
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.650
<v Speaker 5>I still have to get my diploma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started in Lasalle,</v>

441
00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.710
<v Speaker 5>but I still should finish one more</v>
<v Speaker 5>subject.</v>

442
00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:36.850
<v Speaker 5>That's the identity off of things and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>agree with Dr [inaudible] because uh,</v>

443
00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.990
<v Speaker 5>you need the cue more than Iq in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>

444
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.710
<v Speaker 5>All my life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my passion is to help many of our micro</v>

445
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 5>entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We discussed the Labor of poverty.</v>

446
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:52.341
<v Speaker 5>Here is the cost for our drug problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>and for us to enable our small</v>

447
00:26:54.451 --> 00:26:58.120
<v Speaker 5>entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Many of them are survival entrepreneurs</v>

448
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:03.140
<v Speaker 5>to lift up from poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to create the next part of the</v>

449
00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.360
<v Speaker 5>PMS,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the money side and the</v>

450
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:10.440
<v Speaker 5>marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you views to enable these</v>

451
00:27:10.441 --> 00:27:15.420
<v Speaker 5>people to cross and be able to access</v>
<v Speaker 5>the money in the market?</v>

452
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think first small business must,</v>

453
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:27.740
<v Speaker 1>must have big dreams and big companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have small steps.</v>

454
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Big Company always think a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will fall down.</v>

455
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.440
<v Speaker 1>They companies should have small steps</v>
<v Speaker 1>every week,</v>

456
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>

457
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I must have reached this small but small</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

458
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Small companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have big dreams.</v>

459
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I now today serve 20 customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can I serve 200 customers in two</v>

460
00:27:50.821 --> 00:27:53.400
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can a sub 2000 customers,</v>

461
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.300
<v Speaker 1>what are the ways that I can serve 2000</v>
<v Speaker 1>customers?</v>

462
00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:02.660
<v Speaker 1>How can I make this 10 customers who</v>
<v Speaker 1>using my services that'd be happier,</v>

463

<v Speaker 1>we tried to make every customer of my</v>

00:28:08.611 --> 00:28:13.611
<v Speaker 1>company to be the advertisers or</v>
<v Speaker 1>salespeople for a company because in</v>

00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:18.150
<v Speaker 1>this way you have to making sure your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your product's good,</v>

466
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.823
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

467
00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.340
<v Speaker 1>the government should build up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure of commerce.</v>

468
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:28.270
<v Speaker 1>What is the infrastructure of commerce</v>
<v Speaker 1>is at the mentorship?</v>

469
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.300
<v Speaker 1>We should have a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

470
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.010
<v Speaker 1>business schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily mbs.</v>

471
00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a particular fan of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional Mba.</v>

472
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.600
<v Speaker 1>The Mba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make people sometime very stupid</v>

473
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.550
<v Speaker 1>because business is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be flexible.</v>

474
00:28:45.551 --> 00:28:46.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to change yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

475
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

476
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything can be standard,</v>

477
00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.980
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

478
00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.090
<v Speaker 1>whipped the mentorships and we also have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money reaching,</v>

479
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.380
<v Speaker 1>market reaching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I think the technology region.</v>

480
00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So what we call is that this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot see,</v>

481
00:29:11.411 --> 00:29:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot about the Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I see over 100 million people,</v>

482
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.980
<v Speaker 1>99% of the business of this country as</v>
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>

483
00:29:20.981 --> 00:29:24.730
<v Speaker 1>medium size companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should do it up.</v>

484
00:29:24.731 --> 00:29:28.210
<v Speaker 1>The infrastructure of supporting small</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

485
00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:33.570
<v Speaker 1>making sure that every small business</v>
<v Speaker 1>are able to reach the money and today</v>

486
00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:36.670
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to let the big banks to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

487
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.550
<v Speaker 1>We should have used a new technology to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

488
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.840
<v Speaker 1>which I call inclusive financing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be down by Internet technology.</v>

489
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba in China,</v>

490
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Ali pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we serve more than half billion people,</v>

491
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 1>young people in China using mobile phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>payment.</v>

492
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.650
<v Speaker 1>We don't have so many credit card</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

493
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 1>crack hard China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people say,</v>

494
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it's impossible.</v>

495
00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Do the payment in China in the past 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

496
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 1>people keep on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticize us.</v>

497
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you do payment online?</v>

498
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.400
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have a credit card system.</v>

499
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.370
<v Speaker 1>You'd have a credit system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have enough banks.</v>

500
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 1>How can you do greg?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't have the check because</v>

501
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:24.871
<v Speaker 1>we'd have the credit card system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make the most of the vast payment</v>

502
00:30:26.061 --> 00:30:30.350
<v Speaker 1>system in the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Philip Pink,</v>

503
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.420
<v Speaker 1>I think you have the opportunity to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woe,</v>

504
00:30:34.421 --> 00:30:35.254
<v Speaker 1>the best</v>

505
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:41.300
<v Speaker 1>texting or Fintech in the wall because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have so many mobile phones.</v>

506
00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:46.540
<v Speaker 1>You have set more than 7,000 islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible for banks to have offices</v>

507
00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:51.611
<v Speaker 1>in [inaudible] covering everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mobile phone coverage everywhere.</v>

508
00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:56.600
<v Speaker 1>We shouldn't make the pink a cashless</v>
<v Speaker 1>society when you have a cashless</v>

509
00:30:56.601 --> 00:30:59.660
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wished my wig Casio said that.</v>

510
00:30:59.661 --> 00:31:02.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no corruption and lives easier.</v>

511
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:08.230
<v Speaker 5>Totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have basically two telco guys here</v>

512
00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.520
<v Speaker 5>are in a school globe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eric Alberto smart and plap blamed them</v>

513
00:31:13.521 --> 00:31:14.660
<v Speaker 5>for the slow Internet.</v>

514
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.923
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

515
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 5>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>

516
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:30.050
<v Speaker 1>it's unfair to blame anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see this.</v>

517
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Where's the opportunity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Opportunity exists.</v>

518
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.140
<v Speaker 1>The errors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people complain</v>

519
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 1>if you can solve the complaint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the chance where we started the</v>

520
00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speed of Internet in China was</v>

521
00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.620
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much worse than today's Philippine.</v>

522
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much worse</v>

523
00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.460
<v Speaker 1>at that time knowing even three g.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not an excuse for mobile</v>

524
00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:05.750
<v Speaker 1>phone companies too.</v>

525
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.233
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

526
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Slow speed has slowed the services</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

527
00:32:12.881 --> 00:32:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Speed has fastest speed services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great opportunity for,</v>

528
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.360
<v Speaker 1>for the telecommunication companies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this investment guarantee.</v>

529
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.930
<v Speaker 1>You will get the written back.</v>

530
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 5>They're going into the four g now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's going to speed up the</v>

531
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:28.624
<v Speaker 5>Internet.</v>

532
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

533
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:35.910
<v Speaker 1>this is the opportunity for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the four g five g's continue to,</v>

534
00:32:38.561 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 1>it's going to the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

535
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Make everybody good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally we'll be good</v>

536
00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.780
<v Speaker 5>before we go to the students to ask</v>
<v Speaker 5>questions.</v>

537
00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:50.820
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to just call to a successful</v>
<v Speaker 5>techman years Robbie Antonio.</v>

541
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.160
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the smartest people in the world seems</v>

542
00:33:02.161 --> 00:33:06.780
<v Speaker 5>to be very divided in the issue of</v>
<v Speaker 5>blockchain technology.</v>

543
00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is your current stance towards</v>

544
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.060
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I seem to have research that you're</v>

545
00:33:12.061 --> 00:33:15.510
<v Speaker 5>predisposed toward it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how does that conflict with the</v>

546
00:33:15.511 --> 00:33:20.490
<v Speaker 5>overarching goal of China batting at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>exchange and the technology?</v>

547
00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.503
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

548
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.010
<v Speaker 5>Say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blockchain,</v>

549
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:26.320
<v Speaker 5>the blockchain and bitcoins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

00:33:31.321 --> 00:33:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a believe there of the blockchain</v>

553
00:33:35.311 --> 00:33:38.820
<v Speaker 1>technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

554
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:43.020
<v Speaker 1>we have a specific a team in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

555
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Ali and to financing focus on</v>
<v Speaker 1>researching on that because we are</v>

556
00:33:48.001 --> 00:33:52.710
<v Speaker 1>believer of globalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are believer of free trade in the</v>

557
00:33:52.711 --> 00:33:54.900
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The global trade,</v>

558
00:33:54.901 --> 00:33:56.880
<v Speaker 1>global business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization,</v>

559
00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:01.980
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of money transferring</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the safe straight away,</v>

560
00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.700
<v Speaker 1>what is the most efficient away that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

561
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.700
<v Speaker 1>So we put a lot of efforts on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wouldn't say,</v>

562
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.810
<v Speaker 1>let me see this about technology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise</v>

563
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:18.500
<v Speaker 1>competent like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should not the wing our market by</v>

564
00:34:18.811 --> 00:34:23.811
<v Speaker 1>advertising dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should win our market by innovation.</v>

565
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba should not get our profit from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of the business.</v>

566
00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.620
<v Speaker 1>We should get our profit from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that will be invested in</v>

567
00:34:34.621 --> 00:34:38.220
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We invested in heavily nine years ago</v>

568
00:34:38.221 --> 00:34:42.750
<v Speaker 1>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll clock computing a big datas now for</v>

569
00:34:42.751 --> 00:34:47.751
<v Speaker 1>financing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We invested heavily on blockchain but</v>

570
00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:52.170
<v Speaker 1>bit coin of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not big fan of that yet.</v>

571
00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Let me say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

572
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.070
<v Speaker 1>company like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think last century,</v>

573
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.700
<v Speaker 1>if you have a technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to keep it to yourself</v>

574
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:12.140
<v Speaker 1>today in 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a technology,</v>

575
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:16.400
<v Speaker 1>the only way to make you powerful is</v>
<v Speaker 1>enabled others.</v>

576
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Even in there we are competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

577
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba was spent</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars on technology and</v>

578
00:35:28.681 --> 00:35:32.130
<v Speaker 1>when we spend the money on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology will making sure this</v>

579
00:35:32.131 --> 00:35:37.131
<v Speaker 1>technology is inclusive to the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So block chain technology is the big</v>

580
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:42.330
<v Speaker 1>investment that we invest in all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we SSA,</v>

581
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.490
<v Speaker 1>we also would love to partner with</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

582
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

583

<v Speaker 7>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Morning.</v>

591
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.940
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my question is around the ead WTP,</v>

592
00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:20.110
<v Speaker 7>a initiative that Alibaba has taken a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what are the implications of this for</v>

593
00:36:21.611 --> 00:36:25.000
<v Speaker 7>Southeast Asia?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I guess more importantly,</v>

594
00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:26.830
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for traditional businesses and</v>

595
00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:31.831
<v Speaker 7>retailers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how should they view the ewt tp knowing</v>

596
00:36:32.711 --> 00:36:36.070
<v Speaker 7>that it can be very disruptive to their</v>
<v Speaker 7>current business models?</v>

597
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much for this question,</v>

598
00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.870
<v Speaker 1>but you'd governor tpe stands for</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic world trade platform.</v>

599
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.740
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization.</v>

600
00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:54.920
<v Speaker 1>I think globalization did a fantastic</v>
<v Speaker 1>job in the past 30 years.</v>

601
00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.090
<v Speaker 1>They pump up the global trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a growing pain.</v>

602
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a stew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a baby only 30 years old.</v>

603
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.930
<v Speaker 1>The thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that it benefit 20% of</v>

604
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:08.490
<v Speaker 1>the developer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The countries,</v>

605
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:13.770
<v Speaker 1>80% of developing countries don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Young people don't have chance.</v>

606
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.940
<v Speaker 1>The globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the of 30 years was control.</v>

607
00:37:16.941 --> 00:37:21.941
<v Speaker 1>The by 60,000 big companies we think</v>
<v Speaker 1>should at least the 16 million or 30</v>

608
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:27.300
<v Speaker 1>minutes or 60 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small Business.</v>

609
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Young people should be able to sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>small business like anybody sitting here</v>

610
00:37:31.891 --> 00:37:36.891
<v Speaker 1>intrepreneurs Philip Pink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about how you can sell your small</v>

611
00:37:37.651 --> 00:37:40.410
<v Speaker 1>business here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can sell products to China,</v>

612
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:44.460
<v Speaker 1>to career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Europe as well as your service is</v>

613
00:37:44.461 --> 00:37:45.630
<v Speaker 1>good products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

614
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.020
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to compete with any</v>
<v Speaker 1>big companies.</v>

615
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:51.640
<v Speaker 1>This is my belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

616
00:37:51.641 --> 00:37:56.641
<v Speaker 1>WTP is tried to boot up a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not organization.</v>

617
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I feel sorry for WTO where you put 200</v>
<v Speaker 1>government and ministers in their one</v>

618
00:38:02.281 --> 00:38:06.850
<v Speaker 1>room to agree on something impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

619
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.260
<v Speaker 1>But if we put the 2000 business people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a one room,</v>

620
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.730
<v Speaker 1>we can't agree on something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing do we want to do</v>

621
00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:17.640
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He WTP,</v>

622
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:21.690
<v Speaker 1>we work with WTO is this is the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>tarts,</v>

623
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:25.590
<v Speaker 1>zero version of WTO supporting small</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

624
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:30.800
<v Speaker 1>young people that we encouraging every</v>
<v Speaker 1>government to set free trade or zoos or</v>

625
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:35.620
<v Speaker 1>small business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so many of free trade zones,</v>

626
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.220
<v Speaker 1>any country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of these free traders,</v>

627
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 1>those are designed for big companies or</v>
<v Speaker 1>small business.</v>

628
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:45.040
<v Speaker 1>If you want to sell things outside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

629
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:49.930
<v Speaker 1>the government would never give you 24</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours customed to careers.</v>

630
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Big Company can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot.</v>

631
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:56.920
<v Speaker 1>So we want the beauty of a process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a platform,</v>

632
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 1>our way of doing business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then every small business you can global</v>

633
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 1>sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>global buy,</v>

634
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:11.620
<v Speaker 1>global pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>global delivery and global travel.</v>

635
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And you can have a marketplaces online</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what we believe.</v>

636
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we come here,</v>

637
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come here to,</v>

638
00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.980
<v Speaker 1>to Philippine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last night I arrived like at 10 o'clock</v>

639
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.460
<v Speaker 1>we had a meeting then us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had the meter until later.</v>

640
00:39:27.461 --> 00:39:32.461
<v Speaker 1>12 or two hours discussing how we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>build up the infrastructure of doing</v>

641
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Speaker 1>business in Philippine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the payment system,</v>

642
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 1>the marketplace system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logistic system.</v>

643
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.560
<v Speaker 1>When we build up that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose is to making sure these</v>

644
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.390
<v Speaker 1>small business can sell their things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>China to do the other part,</v>

645
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:54.450
<v Speaker 1>to do militia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the ewt be the first project we</v>

646
00:39:54.551 --> 00:39:59.551
<v Speaker 1>launched is in Malaysia and we hope that</v>
<v Speaker 1>every country in South East Asia can</v>

647
00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:06.310
<v Speaker 1>join the EDA blue tp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every country have a free trader Zos for</v>

648
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:10.360
<v Speaker 1>small business entrepreneurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a marketplace rich.</v>

649
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:15.630
<v Speaker 1>There are money reached logistic rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentorship training rich and Iq rich so</v>

650
00:40:16.721 --> 00:40:20.350
<v Speaker 1>they can do business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I want anywhere in the</v>

651
00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:23.500
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any young people in any country,</v>

652
00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:28.510
<v Speaker 1>open a mobile phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can order products from everywhere</v>

653
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:32.800
<v Speaker 1>in the wall and then get a product</v>
<v Speaker 1>within 72 hours.</v>

654
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 1>And this is the goal that we want rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 20 years.</v>

<v Speaker 1>my biggest mistake that I don't want to</v>

756
00:46:35.951 --> 00:46:39.550
<v Speaker 1>make is the date when I retired,</v>

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:47.400
<v Speaker 1>This is what I don't want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody was sick.</v>

759
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would die.</v>

760
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:55.860
<v Speaker 1>We'd been working hard for 18 years at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this company while the loss a hundred,</v>

761
00:46:55.861 --> 00:46:58.920
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we will never see Ali.</v>

762
00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba is successful because we only</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

763
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:04.140
<v Speaker 1>18 years there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>84 years to go.</v>

<v Speaker 1>In the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next 80 84 years,</v>

765
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:13.160

<v Speaker 1>minute chaz would disappear.</v>

766
00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:19.310
<v Speaker 1>So my job as his fantasy you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I keep this company growing when</v>

767
00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:23.430

<v Speaker 1>when I leave this company is to continue</v>

768
00:47:23.431 --> 00:47:25.590
<v Speaker 1>to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I don't want,</v>

769
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.020
<v Speaker 1>when I'm 80 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 years old,</v>

775
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.800
<v Speaker 1>the company can continue to grow and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot make that thing happen,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I make friends with them.</v>

816
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.860
<v Speaker 1>This is the advisor give you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't invite your best friend to form a</v>

817
00:50:36.861 --> 00:50:38.860
<v Speaker 1>company with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dumb.</v>

818
00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Totally done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see so many tragedies.</v>

819
00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.560
<v Speaker 1>They're up cases and me succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most possibly you will fail.</v>

820
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:57.010
<v Speaker 1>It's better to make friends when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>join the company,</v>

821
00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.550
<v Speaker 1>treat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when the companies that bid,</v>

822
00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:02.620
<v Speaker 1>you cannot make friends who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

823
00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:07.780
<v Speaker 1>We can make colleague friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So friends means when I'm in trouble,</v>

824
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to my I,</v>

825
00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:11.170
<v Speaker 1>to my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

826
00:51:11.171 --> 00:51:15.460
<v Speaker 1>by colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>troubles even to today.</v>

827
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Only days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever problems I have the company</v>

828
00:51:19.121 --> 00:51:20.110
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd tell them,</v>

829
00:51:20.111 --> 00:51:20.790
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frat,</v>

830
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:22.480
<v Speaker 1>trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

831
00:51:22.481 --> 00:51:23.800
<v Speaker 1>What's the Raul?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

832
00:51:23.801 --> 00:51:25.840
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to run out of money in two</v>

833
00:51:25.841 --> 00:51:27.130
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you got to do,</v>

834
00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:34.380
<v Speaker 1>don't shock them by problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So friendship things based on trust.</v>

835
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:44.100
<v Speaker 1>My team trusted me and I trust them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know my team can do better than I than</v>

836
00:51:44.321 --> 00:51:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know they can survive.</v>

837
00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:52.540
<v Speaker 1>They will when they're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent time with them when I'm in</v>

838
00:51:52.541 --> 00:51:55.810
<v Speaker 1>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found many of my friends came to talk</v>

839
00:51:55.811 --> 00:51:58.210
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hot help to me.</v>

840
00:51:58.820 --> 00:51:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friendship.</v>

841
00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:09.043
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

845
00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Friendship is about trust building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

846
00:52:13.211 --> 00:52:14.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't have friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the business.</v>

847
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.080
<v Speaker 1>We don't have trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have friends.</v>

848
00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:18.910
<v Speaker 1>That's all the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very simple.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Next.</v>

851
00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.753
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

852
00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:39.710
<v Speaker 9>so hello doctor Jah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>A good day.</v>

853

<v Speaker 9>I'm g o n I am a third year psychology</v>
<v Speaker 9>majors through it then.</v>

854
00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.190
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and here's my question.</v>

855
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.130
<v Speaker 9>So the trend today is that there are</v>
<v Speaker 9>many young people who do things</v>

856
00:52:50.131 --> 00:52:52.310
<v Speaker 9>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So there are,</v>

857
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:57.290
<v Speaker 9>they have their full time jobs while</v>
<v Speaker 9>doing their studies or doing part time</v>

858
00:52:57.291 --> 00:52:58.240
<v Speaker 9>work.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>

859
00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:03.250
<v Speaker 9>there are others who also wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 9>pursue their plants or passion in doing</v>

860
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:08.621
<v Speaker 9>business and open up their businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So in the perspective of prior</v>

861
00:53:08.841 --> 00:53:12.140
<v Speaker 9>authorization,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what advice can you give to these young</v>

862
00:53:12.141 --> 00:53:15.950
<v Speaker 9>people who wanted to pursue their dream</v>
<v Speaker 9>of doing business while doing these</v>

863
00:53:15.951 --> 00:53:17.000
<v Speaker 9>other tasks?</v>

864
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.843
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

865
00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.800
<v Speaker 1>say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it simple.</v>

866
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So given that the</v>

867
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:31.130
<v Speaker 1>young people of the day have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they really wanted to do a,</v>

868
00:53:31.321 --> 00:53:34.590
<v Speaker 1>what advice can you give to the young</v>
<v Speaker 1>people of the day?</v>

869
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of prioritization,</v>

870
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:42.140
<v Speaker 1>what advice can you give to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

871
00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.240
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

872
00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:47.720
<v Speaker 1>first let me say a young people have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of things to do.</v>

873
00:53:47.721 --> 00:53:50.570
<v Speaker 1>He wants to do a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is better than the young people.</v>

874
00:53:50.571 --> 00:53:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Was that anything he wanted to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of things.</v>

875
00:53:54.561 --> 00:53:57.590
<v Speaker 1>You want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least you have hope.</v>

876
00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I like these kinds of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to focus on the things and</v>

877
00:54:05.421 --> 00:54:07.790
<v Speaker 1>how to folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the priority my way if not,</v>

878
00:54:07.791 --> 00:54:12.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to pick up the things that you</v>

879
00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:17.350
<v Speaker 1>are really passionate about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You love to do it where you do business.</v>

880
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:20.210
<v Speaker 1>You have to do things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe in,</v>

881
00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.620
<v Speaker 1>you love to do it.</v>

882
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:23.750
<v Speaker 1>If you're not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like it.</v>

883
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:28.780
<v Speaker 1>You cannot sustain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you love it or you have a passion</v>

884
00:54:29.091 --> 00:54:31.610
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my priority.</v>

885
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Do not pick up the thing that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>important or your father said it's</v>

886
00:54:35.691 --> 00:54:36.980
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so.</v>

887
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:42.140
<v Speaker 1>They're could go nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Pi r e t to me is where you are tiny.</v>

888
00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Pick up the things you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh you love,</v>

889
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.080
<v Speaker 1>you're good at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that I can last long.</v>

890
00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Don't pick up things that is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will never lost law and the other</v>

891
00:54:58.491 --> 00:55:00.890
<v Speaker 1>people think is big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is something that I,</v>

892
00:55:00.891 --> 00:55:05.891
<v Speaker 1>that that was m and a by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pirate ret of your choice of doing</v>

893
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:13.480
<v Speaker 1>whether study or work at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning way you do the business you</v>

894
00:55:16.731 --> 00:55:21.710
<v Speaker 1>learn from the business way is school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to put the all the knowledge</v>

895
00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:26.140
<v Speaker 1>into practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I a lot of people wonder Rizza uh,</v>

896
00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:28.250
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There is only one bill gates.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good morning,</v>

933
00:57:27.131 --> 00:57:27.964
<v Speaker 3>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark.</v>

934
00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your friend,</v>

935
00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Masa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son,</v>

936
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:32.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>histories.</v>

937
00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Then hand is deploying $100 billion</v>
<v Speaker 3>vision fund around companies.</v>

938
00:57:38.501 --> 00:57:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

939
00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:44.230
<v Speaker 3>deploying the power of ai and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet of things and talks about</v>

940
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 3>singularity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to know whether you agree with</v>

941
00:57:48.101 --> 00:57:50.080
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk about it and what are your</v>

942
00:57:50.081 --> 00:57:52.450
<v Speaker 3>thoughts around the area?</v>

943
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the,</v>

944
00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:00.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Internet of things or the future</v>

945
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.780
<v Speaker 1>and artificial intelligence is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

946
00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:06.530
<v Speaker 1>is such a hot topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

947
00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:11.110
<v Speaker 1>this is something different from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American way of artificial.</v>

948
00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:14.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think artificial intelligence is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great,</v>

949
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.000
<v Speaker 1>is a good word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proper would.</v>

950
00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's called a machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

951
00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think human being have wisdoms.</v>

952
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Machine have intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an animal have instinct.</v>

953
00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Today the artificial intelligence is</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to make machine think like a</v>

954
00:58:36.761 --> 00:58:39.790
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human Beings,</v>

955
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.060
<v Speaker 1>human beings only know 80% of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>

956
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:47.860
<v Speaker 1>And how can you make machine to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the 80%</v>

957
00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:54.850
<v Speaker 1>and folk sample when we've judged people</v>
<v Speaker 1>using human eyes would take a pictures</v>

958
00:58:56.321 --> 00:59:01.321
<v Speaker 1>when we analyze why machine should he</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the picture and the legs that human</v>

959
00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:04.960
<v Speaker 1>being machine should have as a machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

960
00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:09.430
<v Speaker 1>So I think today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence in the western</v>

961
00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:12.160
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

962
00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:17.140
<v Speaker 1>it's good to record but the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ali Baba focus on machine</v>

963
00:59:17.141 --> 00:59:20.290
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Machine should have do things that human</v>

964
00:59:20.291 --> 00:59:24.650
<v Speaker 1>being cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well machine should learn like a human</v>

965
00:59:24.651 --> 00:59:27.980
<v Speaker 1>beings are machine will never be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think like human beings.</v>

966
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Human beings have the belief had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion had the valley,</v>

967
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but she may not have.</v>

968
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:38.000
<v Speaker 1>So what I want to say is that all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

969
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:39.860
<v Speaker 1>especially primary school king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the schools,</v>

970
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 1>we have to be very careful the way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach to our kids today,</v>

971
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:47.360
<v Speaker 1>we'll meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make our kids so to use later,</v>

972
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:52.510
<v Speaker 1>cannot find the jobs</v>
<v Speaker 1>because machine are much smarter than</v>

973
00:59:53.151 --> 00:59:56.090
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can calculate a faster renetta</v>

974
00:59:56.091 --> 00:59:59.240
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we teach our kids the way we</v>

975
00:59:59.241 --> 01:00:04.241
<v Speaker 1>taught in the past 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our kids were not find the jobs the next</v>

976
01:00:05.181 --> 01:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>30 years because machine would take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of jobs up us.</v>

977
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.120
<v Speaker 1>What other things the machine can never</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

978
01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.870
<v Speaker 1>This is something that education system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every country should pay attention to</v>

979
01:00:14.871 --> 01:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what am I view about artificial</v>

980
01:00:18.051 --> 01:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of the date of the college,</v>

981
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:25.610
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the Internet of the things is</v>

982
01:00:25.611 --> 01:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>going to be meeting Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything will be connected.</v>

983
01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:28.763
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

984
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:30.883
<v Speaker 8>And could you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sorry,</v>

985
01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:33.270
<v Speaker 8>we only have one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sorry,</v>

986
01:00:33.271 --> 01:00:35.530
<v Speaker 8>one question,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one final question from the students</v>

987
01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:38.100
<v Speaker 8>then.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

988
01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:41.940
<v Speaker 8>And this will be the last question.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm sorry we don't have much time so</v>

989
01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.620
<v Speaker 8>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>

990
01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.870
<v Speaker 8>hi doctor Ma.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm Jonathan Iran,</v>

991
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:49.590
<v Speaker 8>third year industrial engineering from</v>
<v Speaker 8>the Gokongwei College of Engineering.</v>

992
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:53.250
<v Speaker 8>So my question is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what is the one global issue that you</v>

993
01:00:53.251 --> 01:00:55.290
<v Speaker 8>are personally passionate in solving?</v>

994
01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.493
<v Speaker 2>Hmm,</v>

995
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the global is sued that the Carson the</v>

996
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>made a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

997
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>

998
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>sustainable growth that every young</v>
<v Speaker 1>people should have opportunities.</v>

999
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>And how can we have the young people opt</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have opportunities?</v>

1000
01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>We should enable them</v>

1001
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>by technology and we should change the</v>
<v Speaker 1>education system,</v>

1002
01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>improve the education system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something worry to me if we chit</v>

1003
01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:33.680
<v Speaker 1>do anything to control or improve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

1004
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>But the way we teach kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young people are the same way we taught</v>

1005
01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>in industrial time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll go nowhere.</v>

1006
01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.240
<v Speaker 1>So the thing I can send the most is</v>
<v Speaker 1>about education.</v>

1007
01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:50.320
<v Speaker 1>We are okay now if we do not know enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge about what costs the</v>

1008
01:01:52.071 --> 01:01:55.370
<v Speaker 1>environment problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what caused the ink.</v>

1009
01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>Now inclusive problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are the things that we teach</v>

1010
01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:03.860
<v Speaker 1>our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the education systems.</v>

1011
01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>That is z pie articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trained to be a high school</v>

1012
01:02:07.341 --> 01:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a good education system.</v>

1013
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Final level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the thank you.</v>

1014
01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm very honored to be given the</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctorate degree</v>

1015
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:21.683
<v Speaker 6>that</v>

1016
01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I was considered to be a bad student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Primary School.</v>

1017
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I never passed examination for key</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary school.</v>

1018
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Never God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good middle school.</v>

1019
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Never got ice spetters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to three years for entitling our</v>

1020
01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:43.980
<v Speaker 1>university handjob and never be the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 students of my class.</v>

1021
01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1022
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Traditional way of education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was considered to be a failure,</v>

1023
01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>a loser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way we do so what other things?</v>

1024
01:02:55.531 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Something that we can do</v>

1025
01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:00.463
<v Speaker 6>for the future.</v>

1026
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:03.650
<v Speaker 1>This is something that I'm thinking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot about,</v>

1027
01:03:03.651 --> 01:03:06.980
<v Speaker 1>that this is something consider me when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a good education system.</v>

1028
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:11.390
<v Speaker 1>When we change our kids better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our kids would not make the mistakes</v>

1029
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:14.570
<v Speaker 1>that our ancestors and our generation</v>
<v Speaker 1>has made.</v>

1030
01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.230
<v Speaker 1>This is something that I can serve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to really want to put efforts on</v>

1031
01:03:18.231 --> 01:03:20.390
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much,</v>

1032
01:03:20.391 --> 01:03:21.224
<v Speaker 1>Mr John.</v>

1033
01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
