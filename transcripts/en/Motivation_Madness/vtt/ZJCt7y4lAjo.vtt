00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.710
<v Speaker 1>What is it that gives your life a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning and purpose?</v>

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.050
<v Speaker 1>Because once you find that,</v>

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.810
<v Speaker 1>it puts you in your power place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you know what your life work is.</v>

4
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I encourage you to start working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't do it all at one time,</v>

5
00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>do just a little bit of it and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what it is that you showed up</v>

6
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.420
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know why you're here,</v>

7
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I encourage you to find out what your</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose is here.</v>

8
00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>What is the meaning of your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will be different?</v>

9
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever asked yourself that</v>
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

11
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I remember coming from a friend of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine's funeral and I was reflecting on</v>

12
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>how much time I had left and I went for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a walk in the park thinking about this</v>

13
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>guy whose life was so promising and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean he wasn't an old guy who was quite</v>

14
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 1>young in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought about all of the things</v>

15
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 1>that he said he was going to do and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>never got a chance to do those things.</v>

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>And I start thinking about my own life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how much time I had left to do the</v>

17
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:08.021
<v Speaker 1>things that I would like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that time I wasn't sure what my</v>

18
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Speaker 1>life purpose was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what my life's work was.</v>

19
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sure about it at that time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it quite a lot.</v>

20
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I had some idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't convinced that I don't</v>

21
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>think I felt worthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't believe that it could be me to</v>

22
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 1>do this kind of work that I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

23
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 1>And I say to you that if you began to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a conscious effort to find out what</v>

24
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:38.201
<v Speaker 1>it is and you're supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that it can literally save your</v>

25
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:43.790
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said that it can literally save your</v>

26
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 five percent of the American public.</v>

27
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>I caught him to recent studies are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to jobs that they hate working on jobs</v>

28
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:59.841
<v Speaker 1>that do not challenge them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get sick.</v>

29
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because see,</v>

30
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 1>when you go to a job and you already</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how far you can go,</v>

31
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>you can already see that proverbial</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass ceiling.</v>

32
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.600
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're going someplace and you</v>

33
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 1>already know how much you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>

34
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you already know how far you can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in a dead end position.</v>

35
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>It erodes your self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lowers your sense of yourself.</v>

36
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.890
<v Speaker 1>It creates an inner turmoil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates an emptiness in you.</v>

37
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>Say That your life is worth finding what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that you're supposed to do,</v>

38
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying quit your job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying find it to do just a little</v>

39
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>bit on just on working at it just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

40
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>but do find out what your work is and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold onto it and don't let your dream</v>

41
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't let it go.</v>

42
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's something else I want you to</v>

43
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>begin to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that most people don't pursue</v>

44
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>their dreams that don't do better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing?</v>

45
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>If they're capable of doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that many of us don't go the</v>

46
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>next step because we don't know what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do yet,</v>

47
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>and I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that we don't even</v>

48
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.921
<v Speaker 1>explore the possibility of what to do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because subconsciously we don't believe</v>

49
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>that it can happen for us and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that we deserve it.</v>

50
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>So here's what I'm suggesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you spend working on</v>

51
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you spend every day</v>

52
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 1>working on your dream and the last 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

53
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.920
<v Speaker 1>how many books have you read</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the last year,</v>

54
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.480
<v Speaker 1>what new skill or knowledge have you</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquired?</v>

55
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.960
<v Speaker 1>What kind of investment have you made in</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

56
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>So I'm saying that as you begin to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at where you want to go,</v>

57
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>if you want to make it today and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are changing so fast,</v>

58
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>you have to literally run to stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

59
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that you've got to make some</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious effort to begin to work to</v>

60
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 1>develop you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's something else.</v>

61
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Most people are not living their dreams</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of fear.</v>

62
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear limited vision and lack of self</v>

63
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 1>esteem is what keeps most people doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

64
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same reason that people stay in</v>

65
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 1>relationships where they abuse or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're unhappy or it's unfulfilling.</v>

66
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>They can't see themselves beyond that</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

67
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>They can't see themselves enjoying life</v>
<v Speaker 1>without that person.</v>

68
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>They think that this has all been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can do the same reason that people</v>

69
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>get stuck at a certain level in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't see things being better for</v>

70
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>them and they think that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is all they deserve.</v>

71
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>This is all they've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been passed onto them and they fade</v>

72
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 1>with this is it for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

73
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll look in what Dr Blanton Smiley</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blanton,</v>

74
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.820
<v Speaker 1>who is a colleague of Dr Norman Vincent</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peale,</v>

75
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.990
<v Speaker 1>what he said about theories that fear is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most subtle and destructive of all</v>

76
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>human diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

77
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>fear kills dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear kills hope.</v>

78
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.480
<v Speaker 1>Fear what people in the hospital fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>can age you.</v>

79
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Fair Ladies and gentlemen can hold you</v>
<v Speaker 1>back from doing something that you know</v>

80
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>within yourself that you are capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

81
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>but it will paralyze you</v>

82
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.350
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like you're in a hypnotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>spell and I asked you a question.</v>

83
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:44.760
<v Speaker 1>What is the benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the benefit of allowing fear to</v>

84
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:49.260
<v Speaker 1>hold you back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the benefit of giving up on</v>

85
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:52.680
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not stepping out on life and taking</v>

86
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:56.070
<v Speaker 1>life on what is the benefit for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's The plus in that?</v>

87
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

88
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I had to ask myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't want to make any mistakes.</v>

89
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I wanted everybody to like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be perfect.</v>

90
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 1>The first time I did something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna happen.</v>

91
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make some mistakes.</v>

92
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>You're going to hurt some folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel it.</v>

93
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>You're going to create some enemies</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you decide that you want to</v>

94
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>begin to take life on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to ask yourself,</v>

95
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>how long am I going to allow this to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold me back?</v>

96
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I like what Zig Ziglar says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

97
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 1>fear is false evidence appearing real.</v>

98
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.660
<v Speaker 1>That is the illusion that we create in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our mind.</v>

99
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.900
<v Speaker 1>It is a state of mind that can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed,</v>

100
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.550
<v Speaker 1>so let's look at how we can begin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take some steps to restructure that</v>

101
00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:44.250
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin to expand our visions of</v>

102
00:06:44.251 --> 00:06:47.520
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to begin to increase our self</v>
<v Speaker 1>esteem.</v>

103
00:06:47.521 --> 00:06:52.521
<v Speaker 1>Webster said that self esteem means</v>
<v Speaker 1>competence and satisfaction in one self.</v>

104
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Look at your life right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you've done up to this point in</v>

105
00:06:57.781 --> 00:06:59.070
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life is working.</v>

106
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you have produced it came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of you as result of the kind of person</v>

107
00:07:04.711 --> 00:07:07.440
<v Speaker 1>that you have become as a result of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices,</v>

108
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.040
<v Speaker 1>as a result of your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have to ask yourself,</v>

109
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.070
<v Speaker 1>are you satisfied with what you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced?</v>

110
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Is this what you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you like things to be better than</v>

111
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:21.900
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe that you deserve better</v>

112
00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:23.110
<v Speaker 1>than this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aren't you content?</v>

113
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.220
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do everything.</v>

114
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Anything else that you already with Zan</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in life and said,</v>

115
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy I'm not starving like the</v>

116
00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:34.350
<v Speaker 1>people in Calcutta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you allowing yourself to get off the</v>

117
00:07:34.351 --> 00:07:38.760
<v Speaker 1>hook like that or do you believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the back of your mind or in</v>

118
00:07:38.761 --> 00:07:42.790
<v Speaker 1>your heart that there are some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>great work for you to do this,</v>

119
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.340
<v Speaker 1>something else that has me you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why you are here?</v>

120
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>How do we handle this fear factor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we increase our self esteem?</v>

121
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 1>You have to begin to fortify yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we do that?</v>

122
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I believe that you have to begin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously monitor your inner</v>

123
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>conversation and start talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

124
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Start building yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the only good things you will</v>

125
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>hear about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things that you say to you.</v>

126
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to be your own booster.</v>

127
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Start building yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start encouraging yourself.</v>

128
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do this.</v>

129
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I can make this happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started thinking about becoming a</v>

130
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:25.671
<v Speaker 1>speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

131
00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do this.</v>

132
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I can make this happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I stopped trying to convince myself</v>

133
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I can be a businessman after flopping</v>
<v Speaker 1>and failing and losing thousands of</v>

134
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>dollars and feeling stupid and dumb and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having people take advantage of me</v>

135
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:41.820
<v Speaker 1>because of what I did know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to talk to myself because people</v>

136
00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.650
<v Speaker 1>were saying to me that I was dumb and</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the back of my mind I was</v>

137
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

138
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Look at what I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to say,</v>

139
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:47.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

140
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:48.351
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

141
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

142
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.950
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

143
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

144
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Get your stuff together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can handle this.</v>

145
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 1>You just haven't figured out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all right.</v>

146
00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 1>This is your training theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is tuition.</v>

147
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:04.281
<v Speaker 1>You have to pay for what you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this other people have done</v>

148
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't take an Einstein.</v>

149
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Get you some people that can teach you</v>
<v Speaker 1>some stuff that you don't go get you</v>

150
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>some people that have done it</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully and learn from them.</v>

151
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Take some seminars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>workshop.</v>

152
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Read some books on how to manage your</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

153
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 1>changed the way you see yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to attend to the personal details.</v>

154
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Understand that nobody's gonna take care</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your business better than you,</v>

155
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.530
<v Speaker 1>and when I started changing that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset of beating myself up because of</v>

156
00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:33.950
<v Speaker 1>my mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and start looking at the possibility of</v>

157
00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:37.370
<v Speaker 1>my doing better of my making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adjustments that would have enabled</v>

158
00:09:37.371 --> 00:09:41.240
<v Speaker 1>me to do what I want to do successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things began to change.</v>

159
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.810
<v Speaker 1>I say stopped beating up on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do do it.</v>

160
00:09:44.811 --> 00:09:46.190
<v Speaker 1>I know you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

161
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural inclination for us to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves down.</v>

162
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.190
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're born negative.</v>

163
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I think in a negative consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we live in a negative world.</v>

164
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Here's some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

165
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.230
<v Speaker 1>begin to guard your mind against</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative programming like turn off the</v>

166
00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:07.250
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't watch the news so you've got the</v>

167
00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:08.990
<v Speaker 1>God the kinds of things that you put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>

168
00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:10.700
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't program your mind,</v>

169
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.870
<v Speaker 1>your mind will be programmed because</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are goal oriented.</v>

170
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.810
<v Speaker 1>That's why we die of broken hearts</v>
<v Speaker 1>early.</v>

171
00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:20.450
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're running through life to</v>
<v Speaker 1>early grades.</v>

172
00:10:20.451 --> 00:10:22.190
<v Speaker 1>We're going through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

173
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.280
<v Speaker 1>and I think that Henry David Thoreau</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that most men live in quiet</v>

174
00:10:25.281 --> 00:10:27.770
<v Speaker 1>desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of us go through life running</v>

175
00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:31.340
<v Speaker 1>scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we had created this in our mind is</v>

176
00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:36.341
<v Speaker 1>false evidence appearing real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We made it real in our minds.</v>

177
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:41.630
<v Speaker 1>That's why Churchill said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing to fear but fear itself,</v>

178
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:47.350
<v Speaker 1>that's the disruptive monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So turn off things that can contribute</v>

179
00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:52.190
<v Speaker 1>to your fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn a deaf ear to people that all they</v>

180
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:56.630
<v Speaker 1>can do is talk about how negative things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are because they have bought into the</v>

181
00:10:56.631 --> 00:11:01.580
<v Speaker 1>consciousness of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start attending workshops,</v>

182
00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:04.520
<v Speaker 1>seminars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to tapes on a daily basis to</v>

183
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:07.850
<v Speaker 1>begin to recondition your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to retrain your thinking.</v>

184
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Faith comes by what hearing and hearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hearing,</v>

185
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.400
<v Speaker 1>listening to things that could empower</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

186
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.480
<v Speaker 1>that can enable you to create a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality for yourself in a new life for</v>

187
00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:20.090
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might appear to be strange around</v>

188
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 1>most people you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people think you're strange.</v>

189
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.000
<v Speaker 1>If you're happy today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say these people have not found their</v>

190
00:11:26.001 --> 00:11:27.920
<v Speaker 1>purpose in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they are grumpy,</v>

191
00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:31.070
<v Speaker 1>but that's why they're miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're so negative,</v>

192
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.290
<v Speaker 1>they're hurting and they want to hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

193
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>So start practicing using programs for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind,</v>

194
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.440
<v Speaker 1>seminars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

195
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>workshops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep a journal.</v>

196
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Record your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening with you everyday when</v>

197
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:49.320
<v Speaker 1>you get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a journal near you.</v>

198
00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

199
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.970
<v Speaker 1>we get three to four thoughts a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if we would act on those thoughts,</v>

200
00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 1>hey can change I ally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I did are you setting on write your</v>

201
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 1>ideas down and then once you get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

202
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 1>take the lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the lead out here in the universe.</v>

203
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 1>If you don't take the pledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you somebody else will take</v>

204
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>the plunge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go into action,</v>

205
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.640
<v Speaker 1>and ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be surprised at how things will</v>

206
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>come together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be surprised.</v>

207
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to have some difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges.</v>

208
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.470
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be aware of that.</v>

209
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Things are not going to work out exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>right for time.</v>

210
00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:35.560
<v Speaker 1>They will sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's when life is just playing the</v>

211
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:36.160
<v Speaker 1>game with you.</v>

212
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want you to feel good and relaxed,</v>

213
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 1>but ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into action with your dream and don't</v>

214
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:48.160
<v Speaker 1>avoid where the fights are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get in the midst of the fight.</v>

215
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Get knocked down so you can learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight so you can hold your position.</v>

216
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people don't get out in the arena</v>

217
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:58.420
<v Speaker 1>of life because they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

218
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't get out of there</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want to get knocked</v>

219
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be dropped to their</v>

220
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:05.260
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but say you're going to be dropped.</v>

221
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Whether you on the field or where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not just sitting on the</v>

222
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:10.450
<v Speaker 1>sidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be dropped,</v>

223
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.020
<v Speaker 1>so at least get dropped with something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

224
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 1>that's not most people are spectators in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

225
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be a spectator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get out in the field where</v>

226
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:24.001
<v Speaker 1>the action is and you will be amazed</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the struggle,</v>

227
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.060
<v Speaker 1>there will be a calm period and it began</v>
<v Speaker 1>to click for you.</v>
