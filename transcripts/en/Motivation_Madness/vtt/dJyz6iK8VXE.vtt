1
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.590
<v Speaker 1>What do you say to those of you that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pursue their dreams are locked</v>

2
00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:17.591
<v Speaker 1>into their careers because they are too</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid to take risks and pursue</v>

3
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>something meaningful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:24.050
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be afraid of taking risks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pursuing something meaningful,</v>

6
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.500
<v Speaker 1>but you should be more afraid of staying</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>

7
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:30.410
<v Speaker 1>If it's making you miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the first thing you want to do</v>

8
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:33.950
<v Speaker 1>is dispense with the idea that you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have any,</v>

9
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>any permanent security outside of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to contend and adapt.</v>

10
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:42.500
<v Speaker 1>It's the same issue with children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're paying a price by</v>

11
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>sitting there being miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

12
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:46.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil I know is better than the one</v>

13
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

14
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.200
<v Speaker 1>don't be so sure of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clock is ticking and if you're</v>

15
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>miserable in your job now and you change</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing in five years,</v>

16
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>you'll be much more miserable and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a lot older,</v>

17
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.720
<v Speaker 1>but there's in the luxury to pursue what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is meaningful.</v>

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Our viewers have more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have children,</v>

19
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>they have payments on loans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a luxury to pursue because we lack</v>

20
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:07.461
<v Speaker 1>the resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

21
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

22
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about what makes you</v>

23
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a luxury to pursue what makes you</v>

24
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a moral obligation to pursue what</v>

25
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>you find meaningful and that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean it's easy.</v>

26
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>It might require sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need to change your job to,</v>

27
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a family and children</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a mortgage,</v>

28
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you have responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've already picked up those</v>

29
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just get to walk away Scott</v>

30
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:34.131
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

31
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:35.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like my job.</v>

32
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no strategy,</v>

33
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>but what you might have to do is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

34
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this job is killing my soul.</v>

35
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do I have to do about that?</v>

36
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to look for another job while no</v>

37
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>one wants to hire me.</v>

38
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

39
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>maybe you need to educate yourself more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to update your</v>

40
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.360
<v Speaker 1>curriculum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>veto your resume.</v>

41
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to overcome your fear of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being interviewed.</v>

42
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need to sharpen your social</v>
<v Speaker 1>skills like you.</v>

43
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.510
<v Speaker 1>You have to think about these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategically.</v>

44
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to switch careers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it like an intelligent,</v>

45
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>responsible person that might take you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years of effort to do</v>

46
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say pursue something</v>

47
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.880
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it important to have a vocation?</v>

48
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more important to to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ethos and ethic,</v>

49
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>so I have a program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

50
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>called the future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a writing program that enables</v>

51
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>people to develop a vision for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and then to develop a strategy and</v>

52
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:34.220
<v Speaker 1>so it's based on the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that and it's an extension of</v>

53
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:37.520
<v Speaker 1>the ideas in the book or at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>something along the same lines.</v>

54
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that you want to do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out.</v>

55
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you were taking care of yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were someone you cared for,</v>

56
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>which is rule number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

57
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you should figure out,</v>

58
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could have what you needed and</v>

59
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 1>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>

60
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>What sort of friends would you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would your family relationships</v>

61
00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 1>look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you conduct yourself with your</v>

62
00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you educate?</v>

63
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.560
<v Speaker 1>You need to think through how it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life could be properly arranged if</v>

64
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>you had that ability and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>name it that.</v>

65
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:13.471
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing is is that if you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive goal of that sort and work</v>

66
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.680
<v Speaker 1>towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will move towards it.</v>

67
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>The goal will change because you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn things along the way.</v>

68
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with hundreds of people in my</v>

69
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>clinical and consulting practice and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>set a goal,</v>

70
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>we develop a vision and work towards it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

71
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things inevitably get better for people.</v>

72
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

73
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a moral responsibility and it isn't</v>

74
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:38.130
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

75
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pursuit isn't for happiness.</v>

76
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a moral responsibility to push you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has meaning?</v>

77
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you know,</v>

78
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>if you watch yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

79
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a particularly good day at work</v>

80
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.940
<v Speaker 1>and what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.510
<v Speaker 1>it means that you lost your sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

82
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.060
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're having a good day at</v>

83
00:03:57.061 --> 00:04:00.540
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like first it's one minute to three</v>

84
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:05.541
<v Speaker 1>and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 seconds to three and then it's 30</v>

85
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:07.680
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what school was like for me.</v>

86
00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:08.514
<v Speaker 1>It was like</v>

87
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>

88
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>

89
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I went to my daughter's school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to get in trouble for talking all</v>

90
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:19.850
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise,</v>

91
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.870
<v Speaker 1>surprise when I was a kid and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was bored stiff in school and,</v>

92
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>and so I would misbehave upon occasion</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of pure boredom.</v>

93
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.970
<v Speaker 1>And about 21 years ago I went to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter's school to sit for a class.</v>

94
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:43.040
<v Speaker 1>It was about an hour long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

95
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting there and the teacher had</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the kids on the floor and was having</v>

96
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>some of the kids read to the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of the kids who were reading</v>

97
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 1>couldn't read at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had exactly the same experience.</v>

98
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like being,</v>

99
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like being seven years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly.</v>

100
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>And I could see the clock going,</v>

101
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick.</v>

102
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 1>if I was in this classroom for three</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

104
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I would misbehave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit 40 years old,</v>

105
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I would misbehave exactly like I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was when I was six.</v>

106
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no place to be right,</v>

107
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.530
<v Speaker 1>because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be in a place that</v>

108
00:05:21.531 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>stultifying you don't want to be in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place where there's no challenge.</v>

109
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 1>You might even quit your job if there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no challenge.</v>

110
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good job.</v>

111
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>It gives you security and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

112
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eating away at my soul.</v>

113
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 1>It's all security and no challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do you want to challenge?</v>

114
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what you're built for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're built for your built</v>

115
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>to take on a maximal load,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

116
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what strengthens you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be strong because life is</v>

117
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily difficult and because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil king is always whittling away</v>

118
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>at the structure of the state and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be awake and sharp to stop that</v>

119
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>from happening so that you don't become</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and so that your family doesn't</v>

120
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>become corrupt and so that your state</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to be come become corrupt.</v>

121
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.730
<v Speaker 1>You have to have your eyes open and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>wits sharp and your words at the ready</v>

122
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>and you have to be educated and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know about your history and you know</v>

123
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>how have to know how to think and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to know how to read and you have to</v>

124
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>know how to speak and you have to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to aim and you have to be willing to</v>

125
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>hoist the troubles of the world up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders.</v>

126
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>And what's so interesting about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remarkable.</v>

127
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that's really</v>

128
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>manifested itself to me as I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing these public lectures.</v>

129
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people,</v>

130
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't seem to happen very often</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

131
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>And the audiences are dead quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I lay out this idea that life is</v>

132
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>tragedy tainted by malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone says,</v>

133
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we already always suspected that no</v>

134
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 1>one has ever said it quite so bluntly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's quite a relief to hear that I'm</v>

135
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>not the only person who has those</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicions.</v>

136
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>And then the second part of that is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>better part,</v>

137
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:55.601
<v Speaker 1>and it's the optimistic part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is despite the fact that life is a</v>

138
00:06:56.061 --> 00:07:00.050
<v Speaker 1>tragedy tainted by malevolence at every</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of existence,</v>

139
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the human spirit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can thrive under precisely those</v>

140
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 1>conditions if we allow that to occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as difficult as life is and as</v>

141
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:14.180
<v Speaker 1>horrible as we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our capacity to deal with that</v>

142
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.330
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe and to transcend that</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent spirit is more powerful than</v>

143
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 1>the than that reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the fundamental issue.</v>

144
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the fundamental issue of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Judaeo Christian ethic with its</v>

145
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on the divinity of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

146
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>As catastrophic as life is and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent as people can be.</v>

147
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's malevolent beyond belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

148
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 1>a person has in spirit the nobility to</v>
<v Speaker 1>set that right and to defeat evil and</v>

149
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.680
<v Speaker 1>that and that more than that and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antidote to the catastrophe of life</v>

150
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 1>and the suffering of life and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy of life that can drive you down</v>

151
00:07:57.591 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 1>and destroy you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to take on exactly that</v>

152
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

153
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of work to be done and</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that terrible and there isn't</v>

154
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:12.131
<v Speaker 1>anything so bad that we can't make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse and certainly try very hard to do</v>

155
00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have it within me to decide that</v>

156
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stand up against that.</v>

157
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to strive to make the world a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better place.</v>

158
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to strive to constrain the</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence that's in my own heart and</v>

159
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:28.751
<v Speaker 1>to set my family's straight and to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work despite my tragic lot for the</v>

160
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:32.780
<v Speaker 1>betterment of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything that's in front of me.</v>

161
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.890
<v Speaker 1>And the consequence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The immediate consequence of that is</v>

162
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:41.480
<v Speaker 1>that when you make the decision to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>on all of that voluntarily,</v>

163
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 1>which is to stand up straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

164
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>with your shoulders back to take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

165
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 1>all that on voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you make that decision,</v>

166
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>then all the catastrophe justifies</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in the nobility of your striving</v>

167
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 2>and that's what it means to be an</v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

168
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

169
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 2>When I was 25 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably weighed about 138 pounds.</v>

170
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:15.741
<v Speaker 2>I smoked like a pack cigarettes day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drank tremendous amount of alcohol.</v>

171
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I was from northern Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this rough little town up in northern</v>

172
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Alberta called fairview and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were long winters there and my</v>

173
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:25.590
<v Speaker 2>friends were heavy drinkers and most of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them dropped out of school by the time</v>

174
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:28.350
<v Speaker 2>they were 15 or 16 and went off to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the oil rigs.</v>

175
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a rough town and we drank a lot</v>

176
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 2>and I started when I was 14 and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

177
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I was,</v>

178
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of bad habits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

179
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 2>and things that were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wasn't in great shape physically</v>

180
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 2>and I was also still intellectually</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed by as I am now.</v>

181
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would've been,</v>

182
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.960
<v Speaker 2>that would've been an 85,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I,</v>

183
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 2>but I decided around that about 85,</v>
<v Speaker 2>84,</v>

184
00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little earlier than I was really</v>

185
00:09:58.231 --> 00:09:59.700
<v Speaker 2>going to try to get my act together.</v>

186
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.983
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

187
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 2>so I started doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

188
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

189
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I quit smoking.</v>

190
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that took a long time because I</v>

191
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:10.410
<v Speaker 2>eventually had to quit drinking too in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to quit smoking.</v>

192
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:13.800
<v Speaker 2>And I started working out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started playing sports,</v>

193
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:15.510
<v Speaker 2>which I'd never done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a small kid.</v>

194
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:17.850
<v Speaker 2>I been skipped a grade and I was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>

195
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 2>small for my age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sports were never,</v>

196
00:10:20.071 --> 00:10:23.820
<v Speaker 2>especially team sports were never really</v>
<v Speaker 2>a domain of expertise for me.</v>

197
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Although I skied and went shopping with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad,</v>

198
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 2>went cross country skiing and camping</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>

199
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:31.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

200
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I went to graduate school,</v>

201
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I started swimming the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first,</v>

202
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:40.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical exercise routine.</v>

203
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enrolled in a swim suicides course,</v>

204
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:45.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was me and this like really</v>

205
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>overweight kid and like these 60 year</v>
<v Speaker 2>old women and men naked out exercise me</v>

206
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 2>like mad.</v>

207
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.040
<v Speaker 2>It was really embarrassing me in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>overweight kid,</v>

208
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:54.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd be just panting ourselves three</v>

209
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:58.740
<v Speaker 2>quarters to death at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody workout in these 60 year old</v>

210
00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 2>women who weren't great shape or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

211
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 2>chatting way as if nothing was going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all in the pool.</v>

212
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 2>So that was quite embarrassing as was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to the weight room,</v>

213
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when I started I could barely</v>

214
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.850
<v Speaker 2>bench press 75 pounds and people used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep coming over and helping me,</v>

215
00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:17.700
<v Speaker 2>which was lasting I bloody well wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly needed.</v>

216
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:21.060
<v Speaker 2>And I got to the point where I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>bench press 225 pounds.</v>

217
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that was the best I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I gained about 30 pounds of muscle</v>

218
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:26.790
<v Speaker 2>in a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was good thing.</v>

219
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.610
<v Speaker 2>So like I was kind of a wild man and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

220
00:11:29.611 --> 00:11:32.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bit manic in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my temperament.</v>

221
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:33.631
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of going every direction at</v>

223
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:38.160
<v Speaker 2>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

224
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.980
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

225
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't regret that I had a fine time</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid and I needed really to</v>

226
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 2>get disciplined and I had to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was working on these hard</v>

227
00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:50.700
<v Speaker 2>problems that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 2>that I've been discussing with all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I've been working on them really</v>

229
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 2>obsessively since I was probably about</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

230
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe even earlier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And got to the point around 25 when I</v>

231
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:03.920
<v Speaker 2>was in graduate school trying to get my</v>
<v Speaker 2>phd,</v>

232
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 2>doing all my research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I published 15 papers by the time I</v>

233
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 2>graduated with my phd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was by I think by a fairly large</v>

234
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 2>measure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most papers that any graduate</v>

235
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 2>student at that time had ever published</v>
<v Speaker 2>at mcgill.</v>

236
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that's right.</v>

237
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Might have been twice as many or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice as many,</v>

238
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:21.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe even three times as many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time I wrote maps of</v>

239
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:23.170
<v Speaker 2>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was terrible,</v>

240
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.050
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terribly difficult thing to do because I</v>

241
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 2>was writing about three hours a day</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

242
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:32.140
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't do all that and continue</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my misbehavior,</v>

243
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:34.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sort of my what,</v>

244
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 2>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

245
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hedonistic,</v>

246
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.890
<v Speaker 2>my hedonistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my massive hedonistic consumption of</v>

247
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:48.160
<v Speaker 2>alcohol and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just couldn't keep it up and also work</v>

248
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 2>seriously on the issues that were at</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

249
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:50.920
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

250
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I had to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sacrifice I had to stop messing</v>

251
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>straighten myself out.</v>

252
00:12:56.801 --> 00:13:00.130
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got married while my,</v>

253
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.580
<v Speaker 2>the woman who is my wife Tammy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I've known since she was eight years</v>

254
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she lived across the street from me in</v>

255
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:06.280
<v Speaker 2>this little town called fairview.</v>

256
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.710
<v Speaker 2>And I was in love with her like first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time I saw her,</v>

257
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.980
<v Speaker 2>which is quite bloody thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's worked out pretty well for me.</v>

258
00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:16.120
<v Speaker 2>But she came to live with me about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same time and you know,</v>

259
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 2>we decided jointly to get our act</v>
<v Speaker 2>together and we swore that we tell each</v>

260
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:21.700
<v Speaker 2>other the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think she's actually done better</v>

261
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 2>than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't think,</v>

262
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she's lied to me ever in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our entire marriage,</v>

263
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:27.730
<v Speaker 2>which is unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

264
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:31.060
<v Speaker 2>And it's been so useful because I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>really tell her things that we can</v>

265
00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 2>really talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I tell you,</v>

266
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:34.270
<v Speaker 2>if you want to have a good relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

267
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.180
<v Speaker 2>you embedded in the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't embed it in the</v>

268
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a relationship.</v>

269
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:39.790
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just lies.</v>

270
00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a tissue of lies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it will,</v>

271
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.730
<v Speaker 2>it will dissolve in the chaos as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crisis comes along.</v>

272
00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:48.100
<v Speaker 2>So the truth is a terrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>

273
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.380
<v Speaker 2>not compared to falsehood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

274
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's look at the live chat here.</v>

275
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.710
<v Speaker 4>You hear the Galitary Ian Clarion call</v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

276
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.130
<v Speaker 4>Everything should be equal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything should be equally</v>

277
00:14:04.131 --> 00:14:06.320
<v Speaker 4>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should strive for equity.</v>

278
00:14:06.321 --> 00:14:10.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're a conservative,</v>

279
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.470
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we want are just hierarchies of</v>

280
00:14:15.471 --> 00:14:18.860
<v Speaker 4>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not everyone's a neurosurgeon.</v>

281
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if your father has a brain tumor,</v>

282
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.940
<v Speaker 4>you probably want a hierarchy of</v>
<v Speaker 4>competence for neurosurgeons.</v>

283
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.870
<v Speaker 4>So you can pick the one that's the best</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that he might not die.</v>

284
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.390
<v Speaker 4>That's what a hierarchy of competence is</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

285
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.270
<v Speaker 4>for the postmodernist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no hierarchy that isn't based on</v>

286
00:14:35.271 --> 00:14:36.440
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

287
00:14:36.441 --> 00:14:39.620
<v Speaker 4>because they think the world runs on</v>
<v Speaker 4>power and that's why they're willing to</v>

288
00:14:39.621 --> 00:14:43.580
<v Speaker 4>use power to get what they want because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the only thing they believe it,</v>

289
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.220
<v Speaker 4>but a valid hierarchy of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's God.</v>

290
00:14:46.221 --> 00:14:47.360
<v Speaker 4>We need those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

291
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.750
<v Speaker 4>We need the best plumbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need the best contractors.</v>

292
00:14:50.751 --> 00:14:51.584
<v Speaker 4>We need best.</v>

293
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 4>We knew we need the best carpenters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need the best lecturers.</v>

294
00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.970
<v Speaker 4>There has to be a hierarchy of quality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only so that we know who the best</v>

295
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 4>are and to reward them properly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so that we can reward them so they</v>

296
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:06.880
<v Speaker 4>keep being the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you know if,</v>

297
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 4>if you have a great educator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a great leader,</v>

298
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.710
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a great thinker,</v>

299
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.550
<v Speaker 4>you want to reward them so they keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking and keep educating so they can</v>

300
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 4>tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a reward for their intrinsic</v>

301
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a calculated move on your part to</v>

302
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 4>suck everything out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's valuable as fast as you can.</v>

303
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 4>That's what a hierarchy of competence is</v>
<v Speaker 4>for and the idea that hierarchies of</v>

304
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Speaker 4>competence don't exist is it's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>cynical.</v>

305
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:37.970
<v Speaker 4>It's such a pathologically cynical idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's actually quite patently untrue</v>

306
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 4>because here's an interesting tidbit</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the psychological literature.</v>

307
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.070
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you want to determine what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>best predictors are for lifetime success</v>

308
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.150
<v Speaker 4>in a Western society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

309
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 4>what would you hope for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about intelligence?</v>

310
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.180
<v Speaker 4>There would be a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's hope the smart people occupied</v>

311
00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:57.590
<v Speaker 4>more positions of complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

312
00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:01.430
<v Speaker 4>Because they're smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you want it any other way?</v>

313
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.140
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then so and that's great.</v>

314
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 4>The number one predictor of</v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplishment in western societies is</v>

315
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:09.950
<v Speaker 4>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that means the system works.</v>

316
00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:13.340
<v Speaker 4>What's the number to predictor</v>
<v Speaker 4>conscientiousness?</v>

317
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.181
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that?</v>

318
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 4>It's a trademark or for hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So who called,</v>

319
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:20.450
<v Speaker 4>who gets a head smart?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who work hard.</v>

320
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.830
<v Speaker 4>Now that doesn't account for every bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the difference between people in</v>

321
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 4>terms of their hierarchical structure</v>
<v Speaker 4>because hierarchies aren't perfect.</v>

322
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:30.890
<v Speaker 4>They're corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People get to the top sometimes because</v>

323
00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:32.660
<v Speaker 4>there's psychopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although believe me,</v>

324
00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:36.650
<v Speaker 4>a hell of a lot less than you think</v>
<v Speaker 4>because a psychopath has to keep moving</v>

325
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:39.890
<v Speaker 4>from place to place because once he</v>
<v Speaker 4>reveals himself as deceitful,</v>

326
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:42.370
<v Speaker 4>untrustworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has to go find new soccer's to</v>

327
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.070
<v Speaker 4>fleece.</v>

328
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.490
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no distinction between a CEO and</v>

329
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:49.130
<v Speaker 4>a psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that's only made by someone</v>

330
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:54.310
<v Speaker 4>who knows nothing about psychopaths</v>
<v Speaker 4>being knows nothing about ceos and c has</v>

331
00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:59.270
<v Speaker 4>something fundamental against the entire</v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalist structure because it's simply</v>

332
00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:00.710
<v Speaker 4>not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Corrupt,</v>

333
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 4>sometimes greedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes short sighted,</v>

334
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.120
<v Speaker 4>sometimes running companies that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing their best to auger themselves</v>

335
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:09.710
<v Speaker 4>into the ground and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

336
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Speaker 4>it's bad people running a dying</v>
<v Speaker 4>organization,</v>

337
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.720
<v Speaker 4>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not the case.</v>

338
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:18.470
<v Speaker 4>Our hierarchies of competence are</v>
<v Speaker 4>reasonably functional and not only are</v>

339
00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 4>they functional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're valuable.</v>

340
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.300
<v Speaker 4>We need to know who the competent people</v>
<v Speaker 4>are and we need to reward them.</v>

341
00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:25.850
<v Speaker 4>And even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to tell young people,</v>

342
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.010
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some hierarchies of competence</v>

343
00:17:28.011 --> 00:17:31.070
<v Speaker 4>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a thousand of them.</v>

344
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.500
<v Speaker 4>Go be a plumber man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but be a good one.</v>

345
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:34.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being honest,</v>

346
00:17:34.641 --> 00:17:36.440
<v Speaker 4>one B,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a plumber once,</v>

347
00:17:36.441 --> 00:17:38.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the night,</v>

348
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.060
<v Speaker 4>it was the night before we were putting</v>
<v Speaker 4>drywall in our house.</v>

349
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 4>We were redoing a house and he had put</v>
<v Speaker 4>in all the plastic piping,</v>

350
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:46.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was going to test the joints,</v>

351
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.130
<v Speaker 4>the they're supposed to be glued</v>
<v Speaker 4>together with his pipe glue.</v>

352
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.960
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told them I had to test the joints and</v>

353
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:53.790
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you don't have to test my joints.</v>

354
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:54.840
<v Speaker 4>They never leak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I thought,</v>

355
00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:56.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's okay.</v>

356
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.270
<v Speaker 4>How about if I test them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I went up on the third floor and</v>

357
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.310
<v Speaker 4>filled the pipes with water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>capping them in the basement like you're</v>

358
00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:04.830
<v Speaker 4>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like half an hour later I had two inches</v>

359
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:08.220
<v Speaker 4>of water in the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were 30 leaking joints and that</v>

360
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 4>was the night before the drywallers were</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to show up so well.</v>

361
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 4>So he wasn't particularly competent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the point of that story.</v>

362
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:20.211
<v Speaker 4>But even more so he had put a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the plastic pipe outside where the</v>

363
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:21.180
<v Speaker 4>drywall would be.</v>

364
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.720
<v Speaker 4>So it would have been sticking through</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wall.</v>

365
00:18:22.721 --> 00:18:24.660
<v Speaker 4>So I spent a frenetic night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

366
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.280
<v Speaker 4>sawing through plastic pipe and re</v>
<v Speaker 4>gluing joints so that my well so that</v>

367
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:32.460
<v Speaker 4>the drywall is could come in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the point if you're going to be a</v>

368
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:33.270
<v Speaker 4>plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

369
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 4>be a good plumber because otherwise all</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do is go out there and cause</v>

370
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.670
<v Speaker 4>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't need people to cause more</v>

371
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:41.160
<v Speaker 4>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need people to solve problems,</v>

372
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so you can be a tradesman and you</v>

373
00:18:43.201 --> 00:18:44.700
<v Speaker 4>can be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can make a lot of money as a</v>

374
00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 4>tradesperson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a bloody reliable,</v>

375
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.950
<v Speaker 4>honorable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a forthright,</v>

376
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 4>productive way of making a living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there is a hell of a lot of</v>

377
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:57.690
<v Speaker 4>difference between a working man who</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows what he's doing and one who</v>

378
00:18:57.691 --> 00:19:00.270
<v Speaker 4>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both in terms of skill and ethics,</v>

379
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you work with someone who knows what</v>

380
00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:04.050
<v Speaker 4>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bloody pleasure.</v>

381
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.380
<v Speaker 4>They tell you what they're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tell you how much it will cost.</v>

382
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.850
<v Speaker 4>They go and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It works,</v>

383
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:11.760
<v Speaker 4>and you pay them perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's happy.</v>

384
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.240
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happens when you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>genuine hierarchies of competence and so</v>

385
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:17.220
<v Speaker 4>you to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you listen to these panderers of</v>

386
00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:18.780
<v Speaker 4>egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a gala,</v>

387
00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 4>egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inequity,</v>

388
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.120
<v Speaker 4>and they failed to recognize completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there are differences in rank</v>

389
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:26.340
<v Speaker 4>between people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not such a terrible thing,</v>

390
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:28.440
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you wouldn't be a great lawyer</v>

391
00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:30.780
<v Speaker 4>like it's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people aren't,</v>

392
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.330
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean there isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>something you could be great at.</v>

393
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:37.410
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of hierarchies to attempt</v>
<v Speaker 4>to climb and if you fail in one,</v>

394
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.830
<v Speaker 4>go try in another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the point is you're still trying to</v>

395
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 4>aim for the top and what the hell are</v>
<v Speaker 4>you going to do if you don't try to aim</v>

396
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:45.510
<v Speaker 4>for the top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

397
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.570
<v Speaker 4>flap about uselessly and whine about</v>
<v Speaker 4>your life.</v>

398
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.570
<v Speaker 4>It's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just make you miserable.</v>

399
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.080
<v Speaker 4>You're not reliable to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't help out in a crisis.</v>

400
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.130
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you tell young people,</v>

401
00:19:57.131 --> 00:19:58.740
<v Speaker 4>and this is another message for</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservatives,</v>

402
00:19:58.741 --> 00:20:00.270
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care why you're going to do,</v>

403
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:03.060
<v Speaker 4>but go out there and make something of</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself for God's sake.</v>

404
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Be An honest person and work and get to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the top of whatever it is that you want</v>

405
00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 4>to get to the top of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

406
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.843
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

407
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 4>and stand up for yourself like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>respectable human being and be a bit of</v>

408
00:20:15.031 --> 00:20:17.280
<v Speaker 4>a light on the world instead of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>blight,</v>

409
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can tell young people that and</v>

410
00:20:20.251 --> 00:20:23.790
<v Speaker 4>they haven't been told that by anyone</v>
<v Speaker 4>now and so the young men are so hungry</v>

411
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:24.624
<v Speaker 4>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's,</v>

412
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.170
<v Speaker 4>it's painful to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're so relieved when it was.</v>

413
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 4>Someone finally comes up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

414
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:33.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get your act together a bit.</v>

415
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.760
<v Speaker 4>Disciplined yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See if you can learn to tell the truth,</v>

416
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.650
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on something for a year or</v>
<v Speaker 4>two.</v>

417
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.760
<v Speaker 4>You could be a bloody world beater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think really?</v>

418
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.630
<v Speaker 4>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

419
00:20:42.631 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 4>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be interesting.</v>

420
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 4>That might make life or life worth</v>
<v Speaker 4>living like,</v>

421
00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:48.580
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might.</v>

422
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:51.970
<v Speaker 4>So why don't you go do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the damn universities we're</v>

423
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be teaching people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've forgotten that.</v>

424
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.770
<v Speaker 4>I went to Harvard month ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>month and a half,</v>

425
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.740
<v Speaker 4>used to teach there and I talked to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of students.</v>

426
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:02.530
<v Speaker 4>You know what I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not easy to get into Harvard,</v>

427
00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:05.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're a Valedictorian if you're at</v>

428
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Harvard and not only are you a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Valedictorian,</v>

429
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 4>you're way better than most people at at</v>
<v Speaker 4>least two other things or you don't get</v>

430
00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so like it's.</v>

431
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the acceptance rate is</v>
<v Speaker 4>like five percent and believe me,</v>

432
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:18.910
<v Speaker 4>not everybody applies.</v>

433
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.230
<v Speaker 4>So it's a very selective school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so why am I saying that?</v>

434
00:21:22.231 --> 00:21:27.070
<v Speaker 4>It's like these are high quality kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I told them what I just told you.</v>

435
00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here you are at Harvard.</v>

436
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like get yourself educated man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Read some books,</v>

437
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:33.670
<v Speaker 4>learn to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn to think.</v>

438
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 4>Make yourself into something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get the hell out there and make the</v>

439
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 4>world that put you here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Happy that you were put there in that</v>

440
00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:42.940
<v Speaker 4>great institution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

441
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.520
<v Speaker 4>and they came up to me afterwards and</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

442
00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.530
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish someone would have told us that</v>

443
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:50.170
<v Speaker 4>when we were in our first year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

444
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.050
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why didn't someone tell them that for</v>

445
00:21:53.051 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 4>God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to be the greatest</v>

446
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.960
<v Speaker 4>university in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it so difficult to figure that out?</v>

447
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:00.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>

448
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 4>If that is what you want to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in the university,</v>

449
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.910
<v Speaker 4>you want to make cringing milk sops to</v>
<v Speaker 4>whine about being victims while they're</v>

450
00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:09.580
<v Speaker 4>going to ivy league institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

451
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.750
<v Speaker 4>It's pathetic.</v>
