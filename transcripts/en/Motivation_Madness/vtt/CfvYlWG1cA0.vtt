1
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.300
<v Speaker 1>What I want to say is through growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.780
<v Speaker 1>what I've discovered is that this world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very vast of a wonderful and</v>

3
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 1>beautiful one and there's so many things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to discover that the most important</v>

4
00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:23.911
<v Speaker 1>journey I think all of us will go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through as the journey in ourselves to</v>

5
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:27.640
<v Speaker 1>find our truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find who we are and what makes us</v>

6
00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:30.040
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in our culture</v>

7
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 1>we are told that if we're beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we skinny,</v>

8
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.690
<v Speaker 1>if we're successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous,</v>

9
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>if we fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>if everyone loves us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we'll be happy,</v>

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>but that's not entirely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.060
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

13
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start with a poem that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote when I wasn't very happy.</v>

14
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually read this a year ago,</v>

15
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if you know,</v>

16
00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes back,</v>

17
00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a reoccurring thing that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really sought away anyway.</v>

18
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who am I trying to be?</v>

19
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Not Myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone but myself living in a fantasy to</v>

20
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>bury the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making myself the mystery has strong</v>

21
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:22.960
<v Speaker 1>facade disguising the misery empty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>

22
00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 1>on the point of emptiness full to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brim of fake confidence,</v>

23
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>a God that will never be broken because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I broke a long time ago.</v>

24
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm hurting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't tell anyone.</v>

25
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 1>No one needs to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't show or you've failed.</v>

26
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Always fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always on show.</v>

28
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.170
<v Speaker 1>The show must go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will never stop.</v>

29
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.630
<v Speaker 1>The show must not go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know it well.</v>

30
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.820
<v Speaker 1>I give up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I give up giving up.</v>

31
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I am lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to be saved.</v>

32
00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:53.641
<v Speaker 1>I need to be found basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of just the same reoccurring</v>

33
00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:55.840
<v Speaker 1>thing of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

34
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>not knowing who you are and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and feeling I again.</v>

35
00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this started when I was about 15 years</v>

36
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:01.300
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

37
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I was in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to do well at school to</v>
<v Speaker 1>please my parents,</v>

39
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>to please my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really care that much about</v>

40
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>school because I knew I was never going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be very good at it.</v>

41
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I pushed myself so far.</v>

42
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Got to the point where I had a bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental breakdown.</v>

43
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I was one of those people that just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>just did enough work.</v>

44
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably,</v>

45
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

46
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have very bad learning disabilities,</v>

47
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 1>so if you look at my writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

48
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

49
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 1>it's docketed adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably like a nine year old boy,</v>

50
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>if you know what that looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.650
<v Speaker 1>but I was just pushing past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

52
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got to the point where I went a bit</v>

53
00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:43.360
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was completely suicidal,</v>

54
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to live anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that I was completely alone.</v>

55
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I also realize how lucky I was and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wonderful family,</v>

56
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.830
<v Speaker 1>wonderful friends I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't matter.</v>

57
00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I wanted the wildest swallow me up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing seemed better to me than death,</v>

58
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>which is completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just got taken out of school.</v>

59
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I went to therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got put on antidepressants,</v>

60
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>kind of clawed my way back to some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of rational thought,</v>

61
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>which took a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically I stayed in school until I</v>

62
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:17.401
<v Speaker 1>was 17 when I still was kind of played</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this depression and I was like,</v>

63
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to leave.</v>

64
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Which the rather large disagreement from</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents,</v>

65
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

66
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I left and I knew I had to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise I would just go crazy.</v>

67
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 1>So I started modeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was elements which were fun cause</v>

68
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like this camaraderie of people not</v>
<v Speaker 1>being successful when you can complain</v>

69
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>about all the people who are routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

70
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.610
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

71
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>you constantly are told that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty enough.</v>

72
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>We're not tall enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not skinny enough and people are</v>

73
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're young,</v>

74
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>you think that means I'm not good</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

75
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>As a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that means I'm not living up to who</v>

76
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you kind of get battered and bruised</v>

77
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you've kind of grown a bit of a</v>

78
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would the agencies like?</v>

79
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:01.530
<v Speaker 1>What was an agency like?</v>

80
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thing with models is they,</v>

81
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get used.</v>

82
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing I saw a lot of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misuse from photographers.</v>

83
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perverse photographers to young girls.</v>

84
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 1>A lot of street photographers only</v>
<v Speaker 1>really do this because they want to</v>

85
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>sleep with young models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

86
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

87
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>bad kind of experiences in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by me,</v>

88
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 1>but to other poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor girls who don't stand up for</v>

89
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>themselves because you feel like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be used because that's what</v>

90
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 1>models do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

91
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

92
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a year into it,</v>

93
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I was discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did barbary and then everybody wants</v>

94
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:43.391
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 1>after so long of being like nobody wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>you suddenly like,</v>

96
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.601
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's that?</v>

97
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met you five times and it's pretty</v>

98
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want me two minutes ago,</v>

99
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>but cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no concept of saying no to anyone</v>

100
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.570
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

101
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the most important</v>

102
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>show business lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually learning how to say no.</v>

103
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Have you learned yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

104
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I think life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should always experience things,</v>

105
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>but you should not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should say no.</v>

106
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more about being control and not</v>

107
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>being a puppet is what the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing is and not doing</v>

108
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>anything out and not doing anything for</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else apart from yourself.</v>

109
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Because after a while I just started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get sick and I got this horrible thing</v>

110
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>called psoriasis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at yourself like you're an</v>

111
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:29.020
<v Speaker 1>alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

112
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm so disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for your,</v>

113
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>especially at that time I felt more</v>
<v Speaker 1>disconnected from myself than I think I</v>

114
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>ever had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I was for a long time,</v>

115
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:39.500
<v Speaker 1>quite disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

116
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.850
<v Speaker 1>and as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

117
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>my agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

118
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because usually you have to take time to</v>

119
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 1>fix internal problems.</v>

120
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Like it's food and stress and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

121
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>they shoved me straight into a doctor</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would inject cortisone into each</v>

122
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:53.910
<v Speaker 1>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which died them,</v>

123
00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>but not really in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all those problems I had,</v>

125
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I masked with medicine</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of taking the time to really</v>

126
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>solve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at that time I really wanted someone</v>

127
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>to stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted someone to go,</v>

128
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:09.590
<v Speaker 1>you need to take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to look after herself.</v>

129
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.600
<v Speaker 1>And no one did because I was the one who</v>
<v Speaker 1>had it all like I was.</v>

130
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I had what everyone wanted the of nappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

131
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who say would've.</v>

132
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more like the external life.</v>

133
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be luckier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more blessed,</v>

134
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 1>but the internal battles that were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on or just,</v>

135
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I also felt like I never deserved any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

136
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I was living someone else's dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

137
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>this point is just about like being able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show,</v>

138
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>like pass the mirror at yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really look inside for what you need.</v>

139
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>And what happened was I eventually said</v>
<v Speaker 1>no and I eventually took a break.</v>

140
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I said No.</v>

141
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started writing.</v>

142
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Writing was something that really saved</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life again.</v>

143
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 1>So that pro per and probably came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it was like I would write and I</v>

144
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>would read what I'd written and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone else was talking to me.</v>

145
00:06:58.221 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this,</v>

146
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 1>how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very strange experience.</v>

147
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then after that I found yoga,</v>

148
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 1>which was a huge thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't cry a lot.</v>

149
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I thought emotion as a kid was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weakness.</v>

150
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I thought that if you are emotional that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

151
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a parent,</v>

152
00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 1>like just a silly thing to feel.</v>

153
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>And when I went to Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

154
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I started yoga as a superficial thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I was like,</v>

155
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 1>I want to be flexible and fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 1>like coop yoga people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went in to my yoga,</v>

157
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:35.170
<v Speaker 1>my guru yoga person and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

158
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you doing this?</v>

159
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>And I told him why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he sat me down and we just started</v>

160
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>chanting and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we not meant to be doing like whatever.</v>

161
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>So I was chanting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so angry with myself,</v>

162
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.980
<v Speaker 1>no god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I broke through something and I bust</v>

163
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:51.290
<v Speaker 1>into tears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I hadn't done in years.</v>

164
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at him and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong with you?</v>

165
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a monster,</v>

166
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.310
<v Speaker 1>why would you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was just laughing at me and I was</v>

167
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure was crazy man,</v>

168
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong with you?</v>

169
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.540
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you add an have cried,</v>

170
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I would have been very worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

171
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.690
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

172
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>and also you realize that this is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time you've actually looked at me</v>

173
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 1>in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why is because I knew</v>

174
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 1>when I looked in his eyes that he saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>through me and he knew me and it freaked</v>

175
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:18.440
<v Speaker 1>me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But till this day I've been seeing him a</v>

176
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like finding,</v>

177
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.450
<v Speaker 1>finding people around you who have your</v>
<v Speaker 1>best interest at heart.</v>

178
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of people around me who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were just softer more.</v>

179
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I gave them not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

180
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:33.620
<v Speaker 1>often looking after you and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's about finding people who care</v>

181
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:36.040
<v Speaker 1>about you and support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

182
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've now become them being able to be a</v>

183
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 1>support for other people as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in turn,</v>

184
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 1>that kind of goes around.</v>

185
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to change the world</v>

186
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 1>because little kids think they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be to Paris,</v>

187
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.190
<v Speaker 1>but I have so many messages in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>just young girls and how the mental</v>

188
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 1>illness and depression is not something</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be ashamed of.</v>

189
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 1>And I wish at that time I had realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people go through it,</v>

190
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:01.740
<v Speaker 1>that I can talk to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not alone,</v>

191
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.470
<v Speaker 1>you're not an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

192
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my message has always been to accept</v>

193
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>yourself no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to love yourself,</v>

194
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 1>to embrace your flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think floors are the things that make</v>

195
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 1>us special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cracks within us are the beautiful</v>

196
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 1>parts that need to have light shed on</v>
<v Speaker 1>them otherwise that just left.</v>

197
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also women are great,</v>

198
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 1>that wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful creatures.</v>

199
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Women are the bearer of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it took an experience of</v>

200
00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 1>going to a talk by a woman who dealt</v>
<v Speaker 1>with so much.</v>

201
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>and like all these women Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so incredible.</v>

203
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Like the last talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I've watched her on Youtube and it made</v>
<v Speaker 1>me cry and we witnessed these extreme</v>

205
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 1>experiences that happen to women</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppression and all these other things.</v>

206
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.230
<v Speaker 1>But really that happens every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're all used to it in the</v>

207
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 1>workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in relationships.</v>

208
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Women are constantly suppressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes an extreme circumstance for</v>

209
00:09:55.861 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 1>us to realize it because we're used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it not always confuses me a lot,</v>

210
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 1>but obviously I think we're changing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that now.</v>

211
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

212
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 1>just the point of like supporting each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and reaching out and</v>

213
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:11.700
<v Speaker 1>communicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most important thing.</v>

214
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.920
<v Speaker 1>So I want to help basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno how,</v>

215
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.970
<v Speaker 1>if anyone has any suggestions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I got my first audition that I</v>

216
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:20.190
<v Speaker 1>cared about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cried my eyes out cause I never</v>

217
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 1>thought I was going to be taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

218
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I never thought I was going to be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>actor at all or a model or anything.</v>

219
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.500
<v Speaker 1>I think as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have so many girls come up to me and</v>

220
00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:31.830
<v Speaker 1>telling me that they want to be models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fine.</v>

221
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.270
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think there's so much to do.</v>

222
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I just went to a wonderful talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

223
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 1>genetic engineering and neuroscience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this man who was giving the talk</v>

224
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.810
<v Speaker 1>expanded these as like 10,000 kids is</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the age of seven to 13 who are</v>

225
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 1>doing neuroscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do these competitions and one of</v>

226
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:53.660
<v Speaker 1>the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not doing things in neuroscience,</v>

227
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 1>which haven't been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one done by him until he was like</v>

228
00:10:56.521 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>30 like how quickly things like that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing and but they're not.</v>

229
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.980
<v Speaker 1>There is an awareness sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool stuff like that,</v>

230
00:11:03.981 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 1>that that sounds way cooler to me than</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a model.</v>

231
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.060
<v Speaker 1>But like no one really knows about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just think there are just so many</v>

232
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:14.790
