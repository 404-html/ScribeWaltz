00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>You got to do whatever it takes to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a position to hear God.</v>

14
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 1>God has a crimp to power that your enemy</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot withstand when in order for you</v>

15
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:29.780
<v Speaker 1>to access it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to come into his presence</v>

<v Speaker 1>implementing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in effective ways for your situation now</v>

<v Speaker 1>Retail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always buy it wholesale.</v>

19
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Go to the original sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>

20
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>the place where it hasn't been diluted</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been polluted.</v>

21
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Go to the sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking to you about theory</v>

22
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm telling you was the moment I</v>

23
00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>started getting alone every single day</v>
<v Speaker 1>with God is the moment my life started</v>

24
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to close this step out</v>

25
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>with scripture so you understand what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you is rooted in the word</v>

26
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.610
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At 1:35 says very early in the morning</v>

27
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>while it was still dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus got up</v>

28
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.350
<v Speaker 1>and went off to a solitary place where</v>
<v Speaker 1>he prayed spiritual intimacy window and</v>

29
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>impregnates us with the paddle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to get barb to his plane.</v>

30
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>Step number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>detox and emotionally</v>

31
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>that this is rooted in Ephesians four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 1:32.</v>

32
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of all bitterness,</v>

33
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.010
<v Speaker 1>rage and anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brawling and slander,</v>

34
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.930
<v Speaker 1>along with every form of malice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be kind to capacity to one another,</v>

35
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 1>forgiving each other just as in Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God forgave you.</v>

36
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>For Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is dialysis one I'm telling you to</v>

37
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>do with the stem is to examine your</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual calls in for traces of the</v>

38
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make room for success.</v>

39
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.940
<v Speaker 1>You have to make room for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough in your spirit,</v>

40
00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:18.230
<v Speaker 1>which will cause you are full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and anger,</v>

41
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.970
<v Speaker 1>bitterness or jealousy.</v>

42
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for peace.</v>

43
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Your future is too important to let it</v>
<v Speaker 1>be held hostage by the past.</v>

44
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

45
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>when I say forgiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean that you have to agree with</v>

46
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:44.011
<v Speaker 1>the wrong done to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just declares that you refuse to be</v>

47
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>held in bondage by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any</v>

48
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>your future is worth it.</v>

49
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.743
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked it,</v>

50
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>but that's the goal.</v>

51
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Some of the things that had been done to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be so deeply rooted in you</v>

52
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.460
<v Speaker 1>that you can't let go of it on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you remember it.</v>

53
00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look back to that first step that</v>

54
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:10.460
<v Speaker 1>I told you earlier about getting in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of God daily,</v>

55
00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:15.461
<v Speaker 1>getting alone with God daily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you come into his presence and you</v>

56
00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>laid this bitterness and this anger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and all the hurts and roles</v>

57
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:22.200
<v Speaker 1>that have been done to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you come into his presence,</v>

58
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:24.200
<v Speaker 1>can you lay that stuff on the altar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

59
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

60
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Help me get rid of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me,</v>

61
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.270
<v Speaker 1>get rid of anything in the way of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan for my life,</v>

62
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.340
<v Speaker 1>but I can hear those chains</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling off where you embrace your</v>

63
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.710
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your freedom.</v>

64
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:47.711
<v Speaker 1>You are not a slave in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breakthrough where we all life</v>

65
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust God with your past.</v>

66
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Give it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolute surrender restores absolutely.</v>

67
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Step three for your breakthrough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to create a powerful vision</v>

68
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.910
<v Speaker 1>for your vickery and your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be able to see what's your</v>

69
00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:11.420
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like vision as the</v>

70
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.880
<v Speaker 1>greenness breakthroughs must be first.</v>

71
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't go someplace</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there is no vision.</v>

72
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.600
<v Speaker 1>The people perish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagination is the womb that will get</v>

73
00:05:29.601 --> 00:05:34.070
<v Speaker 1>better to your future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk through life without a vision</v>

74
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.360
<v Speaker 1>in a constant state of confusion and God</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not in the confusion.</v>

75
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Think outside the box by moving your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind into the realm of unlimited</v>

76
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.460
<v Speaker 1>possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the construction right now,</v>

77
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 1>creating your mind today that you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live in tomorrow to find and in great</v>

78
00:05:56.631 --> 00:05:58.290
<v Speaker 1>detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paypal,</v>

79
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>what you watch your victory look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you gotta keep your eyes on the prize</v>

80
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>and you're fishing in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's critical and biblical.</v>

81
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>That's your right and down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Habakkuk two,</v>

82
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>two says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write the vision.</v>

83
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Make it plain so they he didn't read and</v>
<v Speaker 1>can run with it.</v>

84
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step forward to your breakthrough.</v>

85
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Adopt the mindset of the unstoppable</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>

86
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Mine rooted in the truth is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chiropractor other mind,</v>

87
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 1>every situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every trial and tribulation has the</v>

88
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>mindset required to overcome it.</v>

89
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Thinking if the stain alone enough will</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually bring peace and order any</v>

90
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:47.860
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

91
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.870
<v Speaker 1>let's go to the word we demolish</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments and every brick tension that</v>

92
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:57.911
<v Speaker 1>sets itself up against the knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>God and we take captive every thought to</v>

93
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 1>make it obedient to Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To change our behavior,</v>

94
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.500
<v Speaker 1>we must address the thinking that</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces it.</v>

95
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Stop attacking the fruit and get down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the root.</v>

96
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>The word says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be not conformed to this world,</v>

97
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>but be transformed by the renewing of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>

98
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Show me your thinking and I will show</v>
<v Speaker 1>you your tomorrow.</v>

99
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Adopt the mindset of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts right between ears.</v>

100
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 1>The battlefield is over the mind and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to win that every single day</v>

101
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>you get on day in and day out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't take a day off.</v>

102
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Your breakthrough must be possessed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>

103
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Did it there and you have it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical stamp.</v>

104
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Five to clear the breakthrough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mouth is a creative device designed</v>

105
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:54.341
<v Speaker 1>to call for the food of trump says death</v>
<v Speaker 1>and life on the power to tone.</v>

108
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.820
<v Speaker 1>The words you speak aloud will prove</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegiance to the God you serve.</v>

109
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.880
<v Speaker 1>You either serve in God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have faith on a condom down the kind of</v>

110
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.470
<v Speaker 1>boldness and courage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and asked for me and my house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>relationship with God.</v>

113
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a person who didn't know you</v>

114
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.460
<v Speaker 1>overheard your conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would they know that you saw?</v>

115
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Would they think that that God you</v>
<v Speaker 1>started has limits on it all takes a</v>

116
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 1>call for things that be not as though</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were the victory.</v>

117
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Step number six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>master the art of blindness.</v>

118
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Bagging doesn't move God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faith is the only language spoken in</v>

119
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.850
<v Speaker 1>destiny is obligated by universal love</v>
<v Speaker 1>to concede to the demand of</v>

120
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 1>master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Art of blindness.</v>

121
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Doubt is the play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naysayers around you must be quarantined</v>

122
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.900
<v Speaker 1>when you're going through trials and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribulations,</v>

123
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.260
<v Speaker 1>nothing but warriors and soldiers around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

124
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:32.410
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get all those people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt out of your life and your family.</v>

125
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.410
<v Speaker 1>There's people in your family speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

126
00:09:35.411 --> 00:09:39.610
<v Speaker 1>though when you got to shut them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to shut down.</v>

127
00:09:39.611 --> 00:09:44.611
<v Speaker 1>All the enemy still has the power and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to gain access to the mouth of a</v>

128
00:09:45.971 --> 00:09:50.750
<v Speaker 1>righteous person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The enemy will use anyone around you to</v>

129
00:09:50.751 --> 00:09:55.751
<v Speaker 1>sow seeds of defeats over your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like I spoke to you about the last</v>

130
00:09:56.121 --> 00:10:00.290
<v Speaker 1>step about declaring the blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The enemy uses the same principle in</v>

131
00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:02.840
<v Speaker 1>reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to declare and the curse over</v>

132
00:10:02.841 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it can get you to do it,</v>

133
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.920
<v Speaker 1>he will find someone around you to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

134
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.920
<v Speaker 1>So let's go to the war and all things</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever you ask in prayer,</v>

135
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.020
<v Speaker 1>believing you sound real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faith is never subject to circumstances.</v>

136
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.150
<v Speaker 1>It's unconditional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with your physical</v>

137
00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:25.340
<v Speaker 1>senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you saying what to hear,</v>

138
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 1>what you taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you smell,</v>

139
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.610
<v Speaker 1>how you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that.</v>

140
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Faith is more than words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an unconditional activity,</v>

141
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.600
<v Speaker 1>a continuous accident over refusing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept what's current circumstances.</v>

142
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.710
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the promise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in one God says nothing.</v>

143
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can make me believe otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop focusing on your problems and stay</v>

144
00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:53.230
<v Speaker 1>focused on the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

145
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:58.160
<v Speaker 1>things</v>
<v Speaker 1>will not change your circumstances.</v>

146
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Faith will step towards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faith is a step towards power.</v>

147
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.910
<v Speaker 1>The more you move from making decisions</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on your feelings to data,</v>

148
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.480
<v Speaker 1>true faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's power you will have access to when</v>

149
00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:19.050
<v Speaker 1>expectations and dreams collide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they explore.</v>

150
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't matter if a station is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen that breathes life into your</v>

151
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:24.950
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Leave you with one last thing here on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this step is not the length of the</v>

153
00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Speaker 1>prayer that gives it power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the faith behind.</v>

154
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Keep it simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask once and never stopped believing.</v>

155
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.340
<v Speaker 1>The final step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number seven,</v>

<v Speaker 1>God is love and whatever is not love.</v>

158
00:11:50.651 --> 00:11:51.830

<v Speaker 1>core of everything in existence.</v>

160
00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 1>It is by far the most powerful thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>

161
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miracles originated from it.</v>

162
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.300

<v Speaker 1>bound to it.</v>

163
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Encouragement is for racing,</v>

267
00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:00.220
<v Speaker 2>uplifting everyone I speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No sickness has any dominion over the</v>

<v Speaker 2>intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I want to collate my destiny out loud</v>

289
00:21:35.781 --> 00:21:40.781
<v Speaker 2>with people around that will be a high</v>
<v Speaker 2>probability that they would attempt to</v>

290
00:21:41.451 --> 00:21:45.440
<v Speaker 2>have me Baker acted on grounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm delusional,</v>

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I know don't have the talent,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the natural gifts,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the connect seems to image the financial</v>

295
00:22:04.401 --> 00:22:09.401
<v Speaker 2>resources to bring my massive ambitions</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fruition,</v>

296
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.910
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right on the edge of foolishness at the</v>

297
00:22:16.421 --> 00:22:20.200
<v Speaker 2>intersection between genius and</v>
<v Speaker 2>insanity.</v>

298
00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.490
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not qualified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced,</v>

299
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:29.520
<v Speaker 2>nor clip with the things required to</v>
<v Speaker 2>exceed this level of greatness that</v>

<v Speaker 2>is faith.</v>

301
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I believe not in my own efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that on the one who is mighty and old</v>
