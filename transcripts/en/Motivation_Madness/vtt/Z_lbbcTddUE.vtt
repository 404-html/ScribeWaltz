<v Speaker 1>The one commodity that is most valuable</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this earth is time,</v>

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>time to love cancer live from the moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human body is born,</v>

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me say it again.</v>

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>From the moment the human body is born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it begins dying.</v>

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Some happening faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some happening slower.</v>

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Some of US help them happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go faster.</v>

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Some of them prevented from happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner than later.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Coach high coming to you live on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>field of life.</v>

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>How many seconds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many minutes do we waste every day?</v>

11
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Doing things that are no where near the</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals and aspirations and passions that</v>

12
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>we have inside.</v>

13
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>course of a day and realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I do anything I set out to do today?</v>

14
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Write down those goals each and every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

15
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.120
<v Speaker 1>No matter if there's two goals a day.</v>

16
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>If you can accomplish those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're doing more than just making</v>

17
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>it through the day you are living and</v>

<v Speaker 1>live life,</v>

22
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>do things you've never thought of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

23
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're born.</v>

24
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>That's their date that they put on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>left side of the tombstone.</v>

25
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>When you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put another date on the right side</v>

26
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:50.351
<v Speaker 1>of the tombstone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that dash in the middle is the most</v>

27
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>important thing on that tombstone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is alone.</v>

28
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Then throughout that entire time frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were able to impact and touch others</v>

29
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were able to leave your mark on this</v>

30
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were able to build a legacy there.</v>

31
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were able to have it to where people</v>

32
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>remember who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you're living for that</v>

33
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>dash in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to remember your why,</v>

34
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>your why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you here,</v>

<v Speaker 1>your your reason for getting up in the</v>

37
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your reason for pushing yourself past</v>

38
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:34.491
<v Speaker 1>the brink of exertion and giving up your</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for moving on and and getting</v>

39
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>things done in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dash in the middle.</v>

40
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that pushes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just this stop for a second.</v>

41
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Write down your why.</v>

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing this for in life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your why doesn't make you cry and</v>

43
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>that's not your why.</v>
