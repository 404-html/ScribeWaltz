1
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 1>So there was one thing I teach and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to remind you of it.</v>

2
00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting things not going to make her</v>

3
00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good news in a tough economy,</v>

4
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:17.230
<v Speaker 1>it's a good reminder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it doesn't matter what you get,</v>

5
00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:19.870
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter whether it be money or</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

6
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>All those things might excite you for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a relationship as magnificent it</v>

8
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be exciting for a while,</v>

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't keep growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that relationship isn't going to stay</v>

10
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:33.880
<v Speaker 1>excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the secret to real happiness is</v>

11
00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Progress equals happiness.</v>

12
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And if we can make progress on a regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>

13
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.330
<v Speaker 1>we feel alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why at the beginning of the</v>

14
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>year we get this thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I can have this fresh start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could really do what my soul desires.</v>

16
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I can expand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could grow,</v>

17
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I could improve.</v>

18
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I could change or maybe better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

19
00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>I could progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

20
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>think about that progress as an a</v>
<v Speaker 1>liveliness to it,</v>

21
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to work at changing.</v>

22
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>People say all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm working on changing.</v>

23
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to work on changing.</v>

24
00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Change is automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body's going to change whether you</v>

25
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:08.320
<v Speaker 1>wanted it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the years go by and I'm going to how</v>

26
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>hard you work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some changes going</v>

27
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 1>on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy's going to change no matter</v>

28
00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>what you want it to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weather's going to change.</v>

29
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Relationships are going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything in life is always changing.</v>

30
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to work on change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Change is automatic,</v>

31
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>but progress is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to make real progress,</v>

32
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.010
<v Speaker 1>then you really got to look at your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a different way.</v>

33
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>You gotta say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta take control of this process and</v>

34
00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>not just hope it's gonna work out like</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do who make a resolution cause</v>

35
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:35.590
<v Speaker 1>really isn't that what they're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing at the beginning of the year.</v>

36
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>They're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's my resolutions for the year</v>

37
00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>and they really basically tell you their</v>
<v Speaker 1>wishes.</v>

38
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>It's their wishlist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what they hope.</v>

39
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:45.340
<v Speaker 1>It all comes together and then they call</v>
<v Speaker 1>it a resolution,</v>

40
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know what a resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

41
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>When you resolve something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a resolution is to resolve it.</v>

42
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>When you resolve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how it's going to be.</v>

43
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>That's when you cut off any possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the thing you've committed to.</v>

44
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like the old adage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to take the island,</v>

45
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>you burn the boats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause when you burn those boats,</v>

46
00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>there's no going back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find a way to make</v>

47
00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Speaker 1>things work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people,</v>

48
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.490
<v Speaker 1>they're stating what they hope will come</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

49
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.860
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're disappointed,</v>

50
00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:14.080
<v Speaker 1>but they're not too disappointed cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not too vested.</v>

51
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>What does it take to successfully create</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lasting change in your life?</v>

52
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>To not only have a new years resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall through on,</v>

53
00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:22.840
<v Speaker 1>but really have a lasting change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>the first step for lasting change is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much like making a new year's</v>

55
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.460
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

56
00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:29.320
<v Speaker 1>it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first step is you've got to have a</v>

57
00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vision for what it is you really truly</v>

58
00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what you think you want and what you</v>

59
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:36.370
<v Speaker 1>should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

60
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 1>what are most people's new years</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolutions?</v>

61
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna stop eating sugar and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to stop smoking.</v>

62
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna lose 10 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem with that is it's not very</v>

63
00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>inspiring for most people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

64
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not telling you what you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get.</v>

65
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 1>It's only what you're not going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's Kinda hard to have you move</v>

66
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:52.624
<v Speaker 1>forward with that.</v>

67
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>A vision is about what you're here to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create.</v>

68
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>A vision that really works is one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>excites you.</v>

69
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>If you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

70
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

71
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>my resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my goal,</v>

72
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>my outcome for this month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this week,</v>

73
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>this year is to lose x number of pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay,</v>

74
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's not very compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be a compelling vision.</v>

75
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>It's got to have something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the power to pull you,</v>

76
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>not something you have to push yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

77
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two different kinds of motivation,</v>

78
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>push requires willpower and willpower</v>
<v Speaker 1>never lasts.</v>

79
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>What will last is pull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having something so exciting,</v>

80
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>so attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so somebody who desires so much that you</v>

81
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>have a hard time going to sleep at night</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get so up early in the morning</v>

82
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>to a rocket and take it to the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

83
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're looking to create and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was it.</v>

84
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Easy to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the reasons we do seminars</v>

85
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>and events and he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>why do that?</v>

87
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't my not just read a book or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

88
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>It's because when you get an environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're with people that are being</v>

89
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>put in a peak state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're going to a sporting</v>

90
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch a sporting event at home,</v>

91
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>it might have a certain level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement,</v>

92
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>but when you're in a stadium with 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

93
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>suddenly it has a whole different level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of intensity.</v>

94
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>When we feel that in the bottom line of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our follow through comes down to our</v>

95
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>emotional intensity in a different state</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mind,</v>

96
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>you're going to come up with a much</v>
<v Speaker 1>better in a more exciting vision than if</v>

97
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting on the couch going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

98
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>what am I new revolutions for this year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're doing it the morning after</v>

99
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the new year started and your little</v>
<v Speaker 1>inebriated and the football games on in</v>

100
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not going to have the power of</v>

101
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>focus.</v>

102
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>They're probably not gonna have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>power or the energy to create something</v>

103
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>that's going to pull you for this year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to do that.</v>

104
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's gotta be a vision that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling,</v>

105
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>something that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a gift to make sure</v>

106
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>that it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also along with that compelling</v>

107
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 1>vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to have strong enough reasons</v>

108
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to follow through when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the going gets tough.</v>

109
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.860
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the biggest things missing</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most people.</v>

110
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I want to do.</v>

111
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not very exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not very compelling,</v>

112
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>but most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have strong enough reasons to</v>

113
00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>push themselves through what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be necessary to get that dream,</v>

114
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>to get that goal when the inevitable</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges come up,</v>

115
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>when you're starving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry and you're trying to go on a</v>

116
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right when you got no time and you're</v>

117
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>stressed out and you haven't worked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

118
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you're supposed to do.</v>

119
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>When the economy gets tight and what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought you're going to do doesn't work.</v>

120
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 1>And so you give up on the goal instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of finding another way to get there.</v>

121
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't let the fear take you over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got strong enough reasons,</v>

122
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>those reasons can be positive or those</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons can also be negative.</v>

123
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:13.900
<v Speaker 1>They can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't do this,</v>

124
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to cost me.</v>

125
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>And if I do to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I'm going to gain in my</v>

126
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reasons come first,</v>

127
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>answers come second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get a compelling vision and</v>

128
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got strong enough reasons that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will push you through the tough times,</v>

129
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna do things other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

130
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>It's been a collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you get off target,</v>

131
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:32.111
<v Speaker 1>you won't go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

132
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I blew it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get right back on target.</v>

133
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Make the change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make things happen.</v>

134
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>And I know you've done this in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas of your life.</v>

135
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Just think about it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not teaching you something really</v>

136
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>new here today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to remind you of what your</v>

137
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>soul knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta change,</v>

138
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>you gotta improve and you gotta go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a simple process fundamentally</v>

139
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>to make that progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First step vision,</v>

140
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>that's compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second step,</v>

141
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>make sure that they're strong enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to follow through.</v>

142
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Third step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got review it and feel it every day.</v>

143
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had this happen in your</v>

144
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has there been anything in your life</v>

145
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 1>that you've ever wanted so badly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were so desirous of it,</v>

146
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>you have such a hunger for it that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't stop thinking about.</v>

147
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:13.630
<v Speaker 1>It could been a career move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could have been when you're a kid,</v>

148
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been a relationship,</v>

149
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>it could have been anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were obsessed.</v>

150
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to make this happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to attract this to your life.</v>

151
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just wanted something and you didn't</v>

152
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 1>even know how to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was so compelling to,</v>

153
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>you kept thinking about it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>envisioning it,</v>

154
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>imagining it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling it,</v>

155
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>and then stuff happened and suddenly you</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to attract people or situations</v>

156
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 1>to your life and it just came together</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you didn't even have a total plan.</v>

157
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 1>It was just that it was so a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your focus with so much intensity and</v>

158
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 1>emotion so often that it's sensitize you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to notice anything that could get you</v>

159
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a part of your brain called the</v>

160
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>reticular activating system for short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it the Ras.</v>

161
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 1>That part of your brain determines what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you notice in the world and it's really</v>

162
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>important because when you set a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get really clear on a vision,</v>

163
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 1>they're strong enough reasons and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>review it enough and it becomes a part</v>

164
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 1>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of your brain says,</v>

165
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 1>anything that relates to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to notice.</v>

166
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever buy a certain kind of car</v>

167
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.280
<v Speaker 1>or maybe a certain outfit and suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that car everywhere,</v>

168
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>those outfits everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the cars were always around,</v>

169
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 1>but why do you see it now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause your Ras knows this is important.</v>

170
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>This is part of my world now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

171
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 1>when you really get clear and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling and you're reviewing it every</v>

172
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got strong reasons,</v>

173
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.950
<v Speaker 1>you're reviewing it every day and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling it.</v>

174
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 1>The brain becomes incredibly acute at</v>
<v Speaker 1>noticing anything to get you to move</v>

175
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the power of this.</v>

176
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:39.110
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do people do with a new year's</v>

177
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:40.850
<v Speaker 1>resolution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come up with something they kind of</v>

178
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not a compelling vision,</v>

179
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.370
<v Speaker 1>they don't really have strong enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and they never review it again</v>

180
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 1>until the notice that they broker what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said they really want to have make</v>

181
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>happen because they didn't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolve you resolve.</v>

182
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.510
<v Speaker 1>You've got the vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's compelling,</v>

183
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.500
<v Speaker 1>you review it daily and you feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you envision it and you experience it as</v>

184
00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 1>simple as it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now ultimately,</v>

185
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:01.700
<v Speaker 1>what does this really about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

186
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to have lasting change</v>
<v Speaker 1>in anything,</v>

187
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you're really talking about just raising</v>
<v Speaker 1>your standards.</v>

188
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people,</v>

189
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>if you want to know how to change your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and give it to him,</v>

190
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>three words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boring as it sounds,</v>

191
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>raise your standards and what does that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

192
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Corny as it sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise your standards.</v>

193
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 1>So thank you for the breakthrough</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

194
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I wasted my time watching the</v>

195
00:08:19.831 --> 00:08:21.900
<v Speaker 1>little email with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But think about it.</v>

196
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Lasting change is different than a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't always get your goals,</v>

197
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>but you always get your standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it will help you is to think about</v>

198
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to explain standards to people</v>

199
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:33.290
<v Speaker 1>with a different set of words.</v>

200
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Think of it as everybody in life gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>their musts.</v>

201
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.730
<v Speaker 1>They don't get the shits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think about it.</v>

202
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Most people have a list of shoulds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't they?</v>

203
00:08:42.771 --> 00:08:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Don't have a list of the shuts things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do.</v>

204
00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 1>You should follow through on I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should lose some weight.</v>

205
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 1>I should work out more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should make more calls.</v>

206
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:52.610
<v Speaker 1>I should respond more rapidly to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>email,</v>

207
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

208
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I should get into the office earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should be more confident.</v>

209
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your should list is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love to have their should list</v>

210
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 1>make me mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of like New Year's</v>

211
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 1>resolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it does,</v>

212
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 1>it's really exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it doesn't,</v>

213
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 1>which is most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

214
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:08.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a little disappointing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you kind of know it's not going to</v>

215
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.640
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you decide something is a must</v>

216
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:13.530
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an absolute must.</v>

217
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:15.060
<v Speaker 1>When you cut up any possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just say,</v>

218
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find the way I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the way.</v>

219
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they resolve things and they have</v>

220
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>to make a real resolution inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

221
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:24.630
<v Speaker 1>which is they raised the standard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make it a must.</v>

222
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 1>They find a way to think about it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own life,</v>

223
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 1>how could you add some area of your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you raise your standard and your</v>

224
00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:35.100
<v Speaker 1>life has never been the same?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe at one time your life,</v>

225
00:09:35.101 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 1>you smoked cigarettes or he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you did it for years and</v>

226
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>you kept trying to change it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to change it and kept telling</v>

227
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>yourself I should and the one day</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened,</v>

228
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.400
<v Speaker 1>something just clicked you over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something took you over.</v>

229
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 1>That kind of tipping point and inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself you said no more.</v>

230
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 1>There was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different experience,</v>

231
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something inside of you shifted and what</v>

232
00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:00.090
<v Speaker 1>was a should became a must and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never gone back.</v>

233
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Is there an area like that in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of again?</v>

234
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever smoke cigarettes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever eat a certain way?</v>

235
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Drink a certain form of alcohol and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally saying no more and you just</v>

236
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>don't go back and notice this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really take any willpower</v>

237
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:14.880
<v Speaker 1>anymore because somewhere when we make</v>
<v Speaker 1>this click,</v>

238
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.270
<v Speaker 1>we make something a must.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We attach ourselves to it.</v>

239
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.100
<v Speaker 1>It becomes part of our identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I've learned in the last,</v>

240
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>33 years at working with people from now</v>

241
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:27.930
<v Speaker 1>over a hundred countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4 million people,</v>

242
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.090
<v Speaker 1>is human beings absolutely follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>through on who they believe they are.</v>

243
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.580
<v Speaker 1>And you said said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

244
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm really going to work hard to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>

245
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a smoker my whole life and</v>

246
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:41.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I am a smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know your days are numbered.</v>

248
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna be back smoking cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 1>again because we all act consistent with</v>

249
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 1>who we believe we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell people the strongest force in the</v>

250
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 1>whole human personality is this need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay consistent with how we define</v>

251
00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:59.070
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you define yourself as somebody who</v>

252
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>is really conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be crazy and act</v>

253
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:04.230
<v Speaker 1>nuts unless you're really drunk or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

254
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 1>And then you can say if the alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's really just you finally</v>

255
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:10.500
<v Speaker 1>getting permission to be yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alcohol is your excuse.</v>

256
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.920
<v Speaker 1>If you're really crazy person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you act crazy,</v>

257
00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 1>outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playful.</v>

258
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't act conservative because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not who you are.</v>

259
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Very often people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

260
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that kind of person,</v>

261
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:23.490
<v Speaker 1>and I always say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

262
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>when did you define yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really?</v>

263
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>How many years ago did you come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you could and couldn't do in your</v>

264
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:30.714
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

265
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>How many years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

266
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 1>if they really look at how they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>living their life today,</v>

267
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 1>it's based on a set of standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a set of beliefs that they made choices</v>

268
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:44.241
<v Speaker 1>about 10 2030 or more years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean very often we made decisions in</v>

269
00:11:44.491 --> 00:11:48.480
<v Speaker 1>our youth or very young about what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe about what we were capable of,</v>

270
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:52.110
<v Speaker 1>about who we are as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that becomes the glass ceiling,</v>

271
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:53.440
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that controls us.</v>

272
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a corny metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>

273
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time I was with my family</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the circus and there was a person</v>

274
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 1>there and they had this big giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephant.</v>

275
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 1>And you look at this elephant and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>take this little rope,</v>

276
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:06.520
<v Speaker 1>put it around the elephant's neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they drive the stake into the</v>

277
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:08.110
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

278
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 1>you look at this and you know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephant could written down the entire</v>

279
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:12.790
<v Speaker 1>tent with almost no effort.</v>

280
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 1>And yet the elephant doesn't struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't try.</v>

281
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the elephant is conditioned and</v>

282
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 1>they take that elephant condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The elephant,</v>

283
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:20.770
<v Speaker 1>when it's a baby elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they train them.</v>

284
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 1>When if a little baby elephant and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have the power yet,</v>

285
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>they put a big rope around it and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive this huge stake in the ground and</v>

286
00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:28.690
<v Speaker 1>the elephant fights and fights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>

287
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 1>and one day finally that elephant</v>
<v Speaker 1>decides,</v>

288
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm not capable of pulling this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once that becomes the definition of</v>

289
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:38.530
<v Speaker 1>an identity of anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an elephant in this case,</v>

290
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 1>they don't even try anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just who I am.</v>

291
00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:44.620
<v Speaker 1>That's how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way it is in my life.</v>

292
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to ask you to take a look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>any place you've got a limitation.</v>

293
00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Ask Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did I decide to accept that</v>

294
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:53.980
<v Speaker 1>limitation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you may not even see it as a</v>

295
00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 1>limitation.</v>

296
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 1>You might see it as just that's who I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am.</v>

297
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>But so often our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've adapted to be a certain way so</v>

298
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:04.480
<v Speaker 1>that we don't fail or so that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>will like us or respect us,</v>

299
00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:08.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's not necessarily who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joy comes when you're spontaneous.</v>

300
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to be truly happy when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not being yourself.</v>

301
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.840
<v Speaker 1>And most of us have no clue who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a big part of my work,</v>

302
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.100
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever been to an event you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

303
00:13:18.101 --> 00:13:21.100
<v Speaker 1>is to get people to do things</v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously without thinking because</v>

304
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 1>that's when the real you shows up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when the energy comes alive.</v>

305
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you start to connect your true</v>

306
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:29.830
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly there's energy available for</v>

307
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:32.230
<v Speaker 1>you to set a higher standard for what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want in your life.</v>

308
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what this is really all about.</v>

309
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.020
<v Speaker 1>And when to talk about standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I talk about [inaudible] versus</v>

310
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.950
<v Speaker 1>musts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about your own life.</v>

311
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.240
<v Speaker 1>I know there have been areas in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life where some point in time you just</v>

312
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Speaker 1>shifted and you raised the standard in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life changed because whatever</v>

313
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 1>people have their identity attached to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live.</v>

314
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 1>We live who we believe we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it works.</v>

315
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 1>It just kind of like I give an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at your physical body.</v>

316
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Your physical body today is an absolute</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection of only one thing,</v>

317
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.060
<v Speaker 1>not your goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not your desires,</v>

318
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 1>but your standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the identity you have for yourself.</v>

319
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:14.560
<v Speaker 1>If your standard is you're an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's a certain amount of</v>

320
00:14:14.561 --> 00:14:17.170
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a muscle tone and energy that's</v>

321
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:21.420
<v Speaker 1>available in your body on a regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis because that's who you are and so</v>

322
00:14:21.421 --> 00:14:23.770
<v Speaker 1>you do whatever's necessary to maintain</v>
<v Speaker 1>that identity.</v>

323
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strongest force in the human</v>

324
00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:30.040
<v Speaker 1>personality is this need to stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent with how we define ourselves.</v>

325
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't know who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would know how to act.</v>

326
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Once you lock in on that identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain finds a way to keep you</v>

327
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:38.690
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you say,</v>

328
00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

329
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm overweight,</v>

330
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:43.900
<v Speaker 1>I've always been overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm big boned and that's the story</v>

331
00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:46.120
<v Speaker 1>you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're going to always find a way</v>

332
00:14:46.121 --> 00:14:48.160
<v Speaker 1>to get back there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your settling point.</v>

333
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.740
<v Speaker 1>That's your identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where things lock in.</v>

334
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.420
<v Speaker 1>If you see somebody who's in really</v>
<v Speaker 1>great shape,</v>

335
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>you ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you work out?</v>

336
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:56.060
<v Speaker 1>You know the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

337
00:14:56.061 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 1>How often?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll tell you three times,</v>

338
00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:58.640
<v Speaker 1>four times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five times a week,</v>

339
00:14:58.641 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a seminar.</v>

340
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Last people who here works out at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>five days a week and I'm stand up and</v>

341
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you look around that room and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they work out five times a week.</v>

342
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:11.540
<v Speaker 1>As you can see their body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't just get a result without some</v>

343
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 1>kind of action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without some form of ritual,</v>

344
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:16.340
<v Speaker 1>ritual meaning actions you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently.</v>

345
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think he knows people that are</v>

346
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:23.360
<v Speaker 1>out there working out five days a week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have more time than you do or I</v>

347
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:25.220
<v Speaker 1>have or anybody else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

348
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a white less busy?</v>

349
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a must for them.</v>

350
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.960
<v Speaker 1>They must work out that way and they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>made that turn their life change.</v>

351
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying you have to work out</v>
<v Speaker 1>five days a week.</v>

352
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying whatever you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

353
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.340
<v Speaker 1>wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get met consistently,</v>

354
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you identify.</v>

355
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:45.800
<v Speaker 1>This is who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not so much about changing</v>

356
00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:48.770
<v Speaker 1>your identity as there's expanding it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

357
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.940
<v Speaker 1>deciding that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of your goals to lose 10 pounds,</v>

358
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:55.850
<v Speaker 1>which is not compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if your vision was to get back to</v>

359
00:15:55.851 --> 00:15:57.570
<v Speaker 1>my fighting weight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this,</v>

360
00:15:57.571 --> 00:15:58.730
<v Speaker 1>this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this month,</v>

361
00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:01.220
<v Speaker 1>this next 90 days I'm going to transform</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body.</v>

362
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take on a new challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find some technique or</v>

363
00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 1>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a million of them that can</v>

364
00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:07.790
<v Speaker 1>reframe myself where I want to feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger,</v>

365
00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:09.770
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more vibrant than ever before.</v>

366
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Here's my reasons because I want the</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy to really make my life work</v>

367
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.430
<v Speaker 1>because it's tough out there and I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be stronger than I've ever been</v>

368
00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:18.430
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go in front of the mirror and</v>

369
00:16:18.431 --> 00:16:19.880
<v Speaker 1>if I'm making it not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

370
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.650
<v Speaker 1>want to laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to look there and take a good</v>

371
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:22.880
<v Speaker 1>look and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

372
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of whenever I see there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it takes,</v>

373
00:16:26.691 --> 00:16:28.340
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to make you laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smile,</v>

374
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 1>something that's going to tease</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

375
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 1>but someone's going to move you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>another level.</v>

376
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.140
<v Speaker 1>If you identify yourself in a new way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you own that every day,</v>

377
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.150
<v Speaker 1>and that becomes the standard how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>

378
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.070
<v Speaker 1>you'll find the way to make that</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>

379
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Real money's the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it doesn't matter what's</v>

380
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote,</v>

381
00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Speaker 1>in the marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that make money find a way to</v>

382
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:49.970
<v Speaker 1>make money no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't they?</v>

383
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people's standard is to pay their</v>

384
00:16:53.271 --> 00:16:55.970
<v Speaker 1>bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what most people find a way to</v>

385
00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when economic times get tough.</v>

386
00:16:57.831 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's their absolute standard,</v>

387
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:03.110
<v Speaker 1>they find a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people's standard is pay their</v>

388
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:06.080
<v Speaker 1>bills most of the time and some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time they do.</v>

389
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Some people's standard is not just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay their bills but to take care of</v>

390
00:17:09.441 --> 00:17:13.070
<v Speaker 1>their family and maybe even some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their friends and they find a way.</v>

391
00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:14.140
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human may,</v>

392
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.630
<v Speaker 1>some people may be in a family where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have enough money to barely</v>

393
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:21.350
<v Speaker 1>have money to pay their bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They work their guts out and then</v>

394
00:17:21.351 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mother or their father or somebody</v>

395
00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:26.180
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sister gets ill and there's not</v>

396
00:17:26.181 --> 00:17:27.200
<v Speaker 1>enough money to take care of it.</v>

397
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else has money and family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't either,</v>

398
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:31.700
<v Speaker 1>but they find a way to get that money to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of their mother or father</v>

399
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:35.300
<v Speaker 1>don't pay and pay their bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never could do it before.</v>

400
00:17:35.301 --> 00:17:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Why the situation made them raise their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own standard and not everybody does</v>

401
00:17:39.171 --> 00:17:40.400
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else in the family might have</v>

402
00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:41.870
<v Speaker 1>money and still not take care of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

403
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.150
<v Speaker 1>It all comes down to the inner game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friends changing your life is a</v>

404
00:17:47.151 --> 00:17:50.610
<v Speaker 1>change in the inner game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The outside world you can't control,</v>

405
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 1>but you have absolute control over this</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

406
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:57.381
<v Speaker 1>If you learn the dynamics of what shapes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and identity is one of those simple,</v>

407
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:01.140
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental basics that if you start</v>

408
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:03.210
<v Speaker 1>start to shift it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else will shift in your life</v>

409
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:04.380
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are,</v>

410
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:06.300
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to have more than enough money to</v>

411
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:07.080
<v Speaker 1>do what they want.</v>

412
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 1>When they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they want,</v>

413
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 1>with whomever they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute the way they want.</v>

414
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.600
<v Speaker 1>That's their must.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find a way.</v>

415
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds overly simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>

416
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody wants said,</v>

417
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you can take all the money in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the hands of everybody.</v>

418
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Out of all the wealthy people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world who are really successful,</v>

419
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.960
<v Speaker 1>given other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't take too long.</v>

420
00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Those people have it back in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

421
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not because they're manipulative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cause they have a standard.</v>

422
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Some are manipulative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

423
00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 1>but they've got a standard of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna find a way to make happen.</v>

424
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm just simply saying to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take those three magic words and live</v>

425
00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise your standard if you really want</v>

426
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:41.760
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you the most important</v>

427
00:18:41.761 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 1>secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done this?</v>

428
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever told yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're raising your standard?</v>

429
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go make this happen.</v>

430
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go make this much money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to transform my kids.</v>

431
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to create the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship in my life.</v>

432
00:18:52.741 --> 00:18:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to transform my body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

433
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.620
<v Speaker 1>and then you don't have strong enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and you don't lose use it.</v>

434
00:18:58.621 --> 00:19:01.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't follow through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because you didn't back up your</v>

435
00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 1>standards with what makes those</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards real and that's rituals.</v>

436
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Rituals are the power is whenever we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>our Robbins results coaching,</v>

<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

439
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:18.390
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to my ultimate edge</v>
<v Speaker 1>program or back in the old days,</v>

440
00:19:18.391 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 1>personal power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you went to one of my seminars,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what I do is I take these huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges you've got and we break them</v>

442
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:28.770
<v Speaker 1>down into little bite size steps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little things you do each day that after</v>

443
00:19:28.771 --> 00:19:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you do them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get so much momentum that it's easy</v>

444
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 1>to succeed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If you'd went to ultimate edge,</v>

447
00:19:38.191 --> 00:19:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you learned about the hour of</v>
<v Speaker 1>power or the 15 minutes to be able to be</v>

448
00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:45.720
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled or 30 minutes to thrive where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you literally just condition your body</v>

449
00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:49.440
<v Speaker 1>and emotion with a couple little rituals</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it doesn't matter what's going on in</v>

450
00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:51.300
<v Speaker 1>your world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel that strength and it's not</v>

451
00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:52.740
<v Speaker 1>fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not some pump up.</v>

452
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.050
<v Speaker 1>It's coming from inside you and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

453
00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Rituals define us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See all the results in your life are</v>

454
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 1>coming from your rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start with a standard and then have</v>

455
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:06.480
<v Speaker 1>rituals that fallen up like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are where you want to be</v>

456
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:09.300
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have very different rituals than if</v>

457
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:10.590
<v Speaker 1>you're not where you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>

458
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.200
<v Speaker 1>If you're overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I both know you got a different</v>

459
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:16.050
<v Speaker 1>ritual than if you're physically fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different.</v>

460
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.600
<v Speaker 1>You get up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the first thing you do?</v>

461
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.480
<v Speaker 1>If you're fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shoes are there.</v>

462
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.520
<v Speaker 1>You roll over the metal that you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put on the shoes,</v>

463
00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:25.890
<v Speaker 1>you lace and you start walking or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that ritual is.</v>

464
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.590
<v Speaker 1>If you're overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you roll over and you have a very</v>

465
00:20:28.591 --> 00:20:31.050
<v Speaker 1>different ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might roll over several times that</v>

466
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:34.350
<v Speaker 1>turn the alarm clock off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go in and get your Mocha Smoko,</v>

467
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:37.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>special coffee you stop by at starbucks</v>

468
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:40.020
<v Speaker 1>or the case may be you have your nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar muffin.</v>

469
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.180
<v Speaker 1>You know it's supposed to be really nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>

470
00:20:42.181 --> 00:20:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different ritual.</v>

471
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.370
<v Speaker 1>If you have a great passionate</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

472
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.900
<v Speaker 1>you're very different rituals and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come home.</v>

473
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Then if you have a lousy relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become come home in.</v>

474
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:56.050
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you do is you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeting somebody or you're emailing or</v>

475
00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 1>flipping on the news or you don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>come home and what are the rituals?</v>

476
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I study people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

477
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look for is what's the standard they</v>

478
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 1>hold themselves to and then what are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those little rituals that up because</v>

479
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.850
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>success and failure are not giant</v>

480
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:14.830
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't just show up.</v>

481
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.410
<v Speaker 1>You don't just suddenly become</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful or suddenly have this</v>

482
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:19.990
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic event that makes you fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may look that way,</v>

483
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.900
<v Speaker 1>but failure comes some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the little things.</v>

484
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:27.850
<v Speaker 1>It's failure to make the call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's failure to check the books.</v>

485
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 1>It's failure to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

486
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It's feel your to push yourself to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>things physically that you don't want to</v>

487
00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those little failures day after day</v>

488
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.090
<v Speaker 1>come together until one day some</v>
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic event happens.</v>

489
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:43.240
<v Speaker 1>You blame that that event happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you missed all the little stuff.</v>

490
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you agree with me and success by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

491
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.070
<v Speaker 1>is not some overnight event.</v>

492
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.370
<v Speaker 1>It's all these little things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Success is having a vision.</v>

493
00:21:51.371 --> 00:21:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Success is making it compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Success is really seeing it,</v>

494
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.950
<v Speaker 1>feeling it everyday was strong enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

495
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Success is feeling the sense that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>here to grow and I'm here to give</v>

496
00:22:01.281 --> 00:22:03.220
<v Speaker 1>something to the world more than just</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

497
00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Success is caring about other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Success is calling and saying,</v>

498
00:22:07.661 --> 00:22:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I love you in the middle of the day for</v>
<v Speaker 1>no damn reason or sending a note that</v>

499
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.100
<v Speaker 1>will change your relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a ritual of something funny,</v>

500
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 1>playful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a surprise.</v>

501
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:20.380
<v Speaker 1>You knew how many relationships are dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>today because they have no surprise</v>

502
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:23.530
<v Speaker 1>rituals anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to have some rituals,</v>

503
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:27.100
<v Speaker 1>some cool things you do that nobody else</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that gives you a better life than</v>

504
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:29.920
<v Speaker 1>anybody else has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the little stuff.</v>

505
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.710
<v Speaker 1>That's where success comes from in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

506
00:22:32.711 --> 00:22:35.440
<v Speaker 1>it comes to delivering more than anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>could imagine.</v>

507
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:37.000
<v Speaker 1>All those little things that have people</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

508
00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:39.340
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's who I want to do business with.</v>

509
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.020
<v Speaker 1>It's true in any area of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at somebody who's really</v>

510
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:45.190
<v Speaker 1>successful and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

511
00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so amazing,</v>

512
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:48.820
<v Speaker 1>they're such a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to dig underneath and you've</v>

513
00:22:48.821 --> 00:22:52.510
<v Speaker 1>gotta remember something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are rewarded in public for what</v>

514
00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:56.260
<v Speaker 1>they've practiced for years in private,</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself and my business,</v>

515
00:22:56.261 --> 00:22:57.730
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get up and speak and he'll</v>

516
00:22:57.731 --> 00:23:00.730
<v Speaker 1>know notes and you go for three days and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nights in the room is like everybody's</v>

517
00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:02.830
<v Speaker 1>wired and it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a rock concert.</v>

518
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you have that confidence of hall</v>

519
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not confidence,</v>

520
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:10.270
<v Speaker 1>it's experience now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did so much behind the scenes and</v>

521
00:23:10.271 --> 00:23:14.500
<v Speaker 1>I still do to make things right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many people would know that</v>

522
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 1>since the time I was 17 years old before</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walk on stage,</v>

523
00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:19.540
<v Speaker 1>still do to this day wouldn't need to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

524
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:20.374
<v Speaker 1>but I still do it.</v>

525
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I never walk out there without being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an absolute peak state of mind.</v>

526
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are days my back is hurting,</v>

527
00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:28.930
<v Speaker 1>my throat was hurting or I may have had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a challenger,</v>

528
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.830
<v Speaker 1>my father passed away and I've still got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deliver for these people cause my</v>

529
00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:35.020
<v Speaker 1>standard is give my all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time.</v>

530
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Every band has to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to anybody who's been to our events</v>

531
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 1>for five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years.</v>

532
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Some of our trainers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

533
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.880
<v Speaker 1>he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always finds a way to make it</v>

534
00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:43.960
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not an ego thing.</v>

535
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:47.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a standard in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to find the way.</v>

536
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.160
<v Speaker 1>And my ritual though is I prepare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I got the new information.</v>

537
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I figured out how to put something</v>
<v Speaker 1>across better.</v>

538
00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:55.940
<v Speaker 1>What do people need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spend time with our customers.</v>

539
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.340
<v Speaker 1>I see what's going on and before I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage,</v>

540
00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:01.940
<v Speaker 1>each time I have to a ritual to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself in a state of mind.</v>

541
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.370
<v Speaker 1>And I did it starting from like 17 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

542
00:24:04.371 --> 00:24:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I started doing it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I now command my subconscious mind and I</v>

543
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:12.350
<v Speaker 1>say this out loud several times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little phrase set of phrases as an</v>

544
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.320
<v Speaker 1>incantation to kind of condition my mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>and body.</v>

545
00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:18.230
<v Speaker 1>And I'd say I now command my</v>
<v Speaker 1>subconscious mind to direct me in</v>

546
00:24:18.231 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 1>helping as many people as possible today</v>
<v Speaker 1>by giving me the strength and the</v>

547
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:25.430
<v Speaker 1>emotion and the humor and the brevity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it takes to show this person</v>

548
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 1>and help this person change their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

549
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.630
<v Speaker 1>And I started out with a person when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>work with people one on one and I will</v>

550
00:24:30.631 --> 00:24:34.670
<v Speaker 1>do that for 45 minutes driving in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>Volkswagen to go serve and coach</v>

551
00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:37.460
<v Speaker 1>somebody for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I don't say that person.</v>

552
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I say these people and I can go out in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>room of 10,000 people and deliver for 50</v>

553
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:44.060
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do it every time I come back on</v>

554
00:24:44.061 --> 00:24:44.360
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

555
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ritual to go into peak state.</v>

556
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Peak states don't just show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't interrupt you.</v>

557
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Great ideas don't interrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to pursue them.</v>

558
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.400
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Michael Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget at the peak of his</v>

559
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:59.570
<v Speaker 1>career and got to watch his final games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw him backstage and spent some time</v>

560
00:24:59.571 --> 00:25:02.870
<v Speaker 1>with them and it was pretty exciting</v>
<v Speaker 1>time was greatest basketball player and</v>

561
00:25:02.871 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that ever lived and has ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived.</v>

562
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.990
<v Speaker 1>And I asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

563
00:25:05.991 --> 00:25:08.510
<v Speaker 1>you know what sets you apart Michael?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

564
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:11.750
<v Speaker 1>what is it and is it God given talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>

565
00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:12.411
<v Speaker 1>skill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it?</v>

566
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:12.951
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

567
00:25:12.951 --> 00:25:13.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

568
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I can shoot you straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

569
00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:16.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:18.500
<v Speaker 1>me trying to act humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

571
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of tell a lot of God given</v>
<v Speaker 1>talent,</v>

572
00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:20.540
<v Speaker 1>a lot of skill.</v>

573
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I've worked really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he said,</v>

574
00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:26.000
<v Speaker 1>really it's my standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said every day I demand more from</v>

575
00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:28.760
<v Speaker 1>myself than anybody else could humanly</v>
<v Speaker 1>expect.</v>

576
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not competing with somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm competing with Lon capable of</v>

577
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.610
<v Speaker 1>magic formula because most of us lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>our standards.</v>

578
00:25:37.611 --> 00:25:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because please spend time with my</v>

579
00:25:40.341 --> 00:25:41.330
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you become?</v>

580
00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.440
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest reasons I started</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to seminars when I was like 17 as</v>

581
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I have nobody around me as a great role</v>
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>

582
00:25:47.571 --> 00:25:50.120
<v Speaker 1>I could read about somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being around people,</v>

583
00:25:50.121 --> 00:25:51.530
<v Speaker 1>being in the environment was very</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

584
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Finding where to go to work with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who lived at standard life is very</v>

585
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:58.850
<v Speaker 1>different and get around people with low</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards and you compete with it.</v>

586
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.590
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to compete with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

587
00:26:00.591 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean number Jerry Springer know if</v>

588
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:05.180
<v Speaker 1>he's still in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never used to get people on the</v>

589
00:26:05.181 --> 00:26:08.690
<v Speaker 1>show and I thought where would he find</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people and why would people watch?</v>

590
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll you why they watch they watch these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

591
00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Don't my wife's know pretty darn good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compare that person,</v>

592
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.990
<v Speaker 1>learn of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to change your life.</v>

593
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:17.330
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is find somebody with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lower standard and you'll feel good</v>

594
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:20.210
<v Speaker 1>about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you feel that good feeling,</v>

595
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:23.120
<v Speaker 1>it's an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's gonna make you</v>

596
00:26:23.121 --> 00:26:24.470
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend in this year,</v>

597
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:26.720
<v Speaker 1>any other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to step up.</v>

598
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.080
<v Speaker 1>It's to raise the standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to discover what you're capable of</v>

599
00:26:30.081 --> 00:26:34.700
<v Speaker 1>and feel that incredible power of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing through whatever's holding you</v>

600
00:26:34.701 --> 00:26:38.000
<v Speaker 1>back and get to the other side of more</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your true self.</v>

601
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what this game is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look at the best of the world in</v>

602
00:26:41.781 --> 00:26:42.770
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tiger Woods,</v>

603
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:45.060
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his vision to win golf</v>

604
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 1>tournaments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

605
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 1>to be the best that ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his goal.</v>

606
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:50.760
<v Speaker 1>That's his vision.</v>

607
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.160
<v Speaker 1>But here's what's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He backs it up with rituals.</v>

608
00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:55.200
<v Speaker 1>If you just have a vision and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the rituals,</v>

609
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.960
<v Speaker 1>stop lying to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His rituals are,</v>

610
00:26:57.961 --> 00:27:00.010
<v Speaker 1>he started doing things nobody did</v>
<v Speaker 1>before he went,</v>

611
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 1>started lifting weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>golfers lifting weights,</v>

612
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.510
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went out and he changed his swing</v>

613
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.050
<v Speaker 1>when he was the best in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you realized in order to be the</v>

614
00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:11.970
<v Speaker 1>best that ever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna have to change his swing.</v>

615
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think about golf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't change your swing when you're</v>

616
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:17.070
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he went and retrained himself</v>

617
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.560
<v Speaker 1>because he has different rituals than</v>
<v Speaker 1>other golfers.</v>

618
00:27:19.561 --> 00:27:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people are modeling his rituals to</v>

619
00:27:21.241 --> 00:27:22.920
<v Speaker 1>get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

620
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at somebody like Michael</v>

621
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Phelps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 2008 swimmer won seven,</v>

622
00:27:28.531 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only two people I think in history,</v>

623
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:32.970
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have gotten seven gold medals in</v>

624
00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:33.804
<v Speaker 1>one session.</v>

625
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.170
<v Speaker 1>And here's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got number six centers belt and</v>

626
00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:39.600
<v Speaker 1>he's exhausted and he's going in for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that final swim.</v>

627
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how does the guy win by 100th of a</v>

628
00:27:45.481 --> 00:27:50.130
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that was some massive skill</v>

629
00:27:50.131 --> 00:27:53.310
<v Speaker 1>that got them over the top or was it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard that says,</v>

630
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.600
<v Speaker 1>this is who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the champion and no one has taken</v>

631
00:27:57.601 --> 00:27:59.550
<v Speaker 1>us from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somehow in those final</v>

632
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.000
<v Speaker 1>sub-millisecond hundredth of a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pushed himself just beyond his</v>

633
00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 1>competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know about Michael Phelps.</v>

634
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:09.450
<v Speaker 1>What allowed him to be able to push</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond that moment is his rituals.</v>

635
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Go study the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people who swim have these</v>

636
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.820
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable workouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does two and three of the workout</v>

637
00:28:17.821 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 1>sessions a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the other swimmers in the beginning</v>

638
00:28:20.401 --> 00:28:23.550
<v Speaker 1>thought he was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can overtrain you can't do that if</v>

639
00:28:23.551 --> 00:28:26.370
<v Speaker 1>not physically possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had a standard and the rituals</v>

640
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:27.283
<v Speaker 1>tobacco.</v>

641
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.060
<v Speaker 1>So here's my final message to you cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten carried away.</v>

642
00:28:30.061 --> 00:28:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to send you like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minute message,</v>

643
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 1>but you can see there's no script here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just me going a little crazy with you.</v>

644
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:36.810
<v Speaker 1>But I want to really see you get what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want this year.</v>

645
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Don't let this year be like last and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year was great,</v>

646
00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:41.850
<v Speaker 1>still don't let it be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise the standard.</v>

647
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.890
<v Speaker 1>If your life is perfect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary,</v>

648
00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 1>you darn well know you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be happy unless you keep making it</v>

649
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes us feel alive.</v>

650
00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:53.280
<v Speaker 1>It's not what we get to make us happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's who we become and what we're able</v>

651
00:28:53.281 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 1>to give because we become more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sense of contribution is what</v>

652
00:28:56.701 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 1>creates the deepest meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's my assignment for if you want</v>

653

<v Speaker 1>simple thing to do.</v>

655

<v Speaker 1>What's an area of life right now that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really want improve?</v>

656
00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:08.820
<v Speaker 1>What's an area that's important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve?</v>

<v Speaker 1>your relationship with your Creator,</v>

660
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.610
<v Speaker 1>spiritual side of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it your finances?</v>

661
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Figure an area that really matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Decide on that area.</v>

662
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down what your life is like in</v>

663
00:29:26.401 --> 00:29:28.470
<v Speaker 1>that area right now specifically as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

664
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.970
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

665
00:29:29.971 --> 00:29:34.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm 13.5 pounds overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the weight is,</v>

666
00:29:34.981 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 1>whatever the situation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or my body fat's like this,</v>

667
00:29:37.051 --> 00:29:39.510
<v Speaker 1>or I'm pr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wake up exhausted in the morning.</v>

668
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.470
<v Speaker 1>And you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth of where you are right now.</v>

669
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.100
<v Speaker 1>So you're real clear or I'm not in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

670
00:29:45.101 --> 00:29:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I say I want a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

671
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't seem to find them.</v>

672
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.560
<v Speaker 1>All the good ones seem to be gone is my</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

673
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.110
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really do want one,</v>

674
00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:54.700
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your definition,</v>

675
00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a relationship and God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I wasn't in a relationship.</v>

676
00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm planning my escape wherever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I have a lot wonderful relationship.</v>

677
00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 1>We love each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there just isn't enough passion.</v>

678
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.630
<v Speaker 1>Just write the truth of where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the or you want to change,</v>

679
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:11.470
<v Speaker 1>but write how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second step is this where</v>

680
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:12.850
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be really honest with</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

681
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 1>What are the rituals that have put me</v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

682
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Because whatever results you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't like the results,</v>

683
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 1>there's some rituals that are keeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>you in that place.</v>

684
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.390
<v Speaker 1>There's some rituals of what you eat or</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't eat,</v>

685
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:27.820
<v Speaker 1>how you move or don't move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you sleep or don't sleep.</v>

686
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:33.050
<v Speaker 1>There are some rituals in the lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>variety or spice or energy or focus in</v>

687
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:36.160
<v Speaker 1>an area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something you're doing and it's</v>

688
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 1>usually not one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of little things.</v>

689
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 1>They kind of do consistently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you think about getting in a</v>

690
00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:42.100
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you think about working out,</v>

691
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:45.010
<v Speaker 1>whenever you think about money and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a state of overwhelmed,</v>

692
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking about all the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't control.</v>

693
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Just write down all the rituals you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then here's the third step.</v>

694
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.390
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your vision?</v>

695
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.700
<v Speaker 1>And be really specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be my fighting weight.</v>

696
00:30:54.701 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I want to be the strongest I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt I want to be.</v>

697
00:30:57.101 --> 00:30:59.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to turn my whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be specific.</v>

698
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And then last step number four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the rituals that will get you</v>

699
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:05.440
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you need to do differently</v>

700
00:31:05.441 --> 00:31:07.420
<v Speaker 1>each morning if you're going to be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of energy,</v>

701
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:08.320
<v Speaker 1>that kind of strength?</v>

702
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.360
<v Speaker 1>How would you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often would you work out?</v>

703
00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:13.080
<v Speaker 1>What days would you work out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What time a ritual,</v>

704
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.580
<v Speaker 1>something you do consistently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually at a specific time,</v>

705
00:31:15.581 --> 00:31:17.980
<v Speaker 1>so it becomes automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something.</v>

706
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.700
<v Speaker 1>We'll bauer doesn't last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rituals can last a lifetime.</v>

707
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I bet you have some rituals in your life</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now you've been doing for years,</v>

708
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.490
<v Speaker 1>even though some of them don't serve</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

709
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying wake yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make if you want a new year and a new</v>

710
00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:35.140
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to start in January 1st</v>

711
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.530
<v Speaker 1>start today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start with this little video and just</v>

712
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:41.470
<v Speaker 1>begin to see what happens and see how</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy it is to just do a few little</v>

713
00:31:41.471 --> 00:31:42.221
<v Speaker 1>rituals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do them all.</v>

714
00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Just do two or three new things and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't happens.</v>

715
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.700
<v Speaker 1>You'll get momentum because once you</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline yourself in one area of your</v>

716
00:31:47.701 --> 00:31:49.810
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel yourself doing it in other</v>

717
00:31:49.811 --> 00:31:50.644
<v Speaker 1>areas as well.</v>

718
00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I always say something that my original</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher taught me.</v>

719
00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Always remind people there's always two</v>
<v Speaker 1>pains in life.</v>

720
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.050
<v Speaker 1>There's the pain of discipline or is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain of regret.</v>

721
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Discipline weighs ounces is my friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Roan taught me.</v>

722
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Regret weighs tons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have regret.</v>

723
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.680
<v Speaker 1>So right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to change?</v>

724
00:32:08.681 --> 00:32:10.960
<v Speaker 1>What's it really like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the rituals that got you there?</v>

725
00:32:10.961 --> 00:32:13.150
<v Speaker 1>They will take a little homework if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not sure half the people around</v>

726
00:32:13.151 --> 00:32:14.650
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell you what your rituals are.</v>

727
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.980
<v Speaker 1>What do I really want in depth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the rituals that will get me</v>

728
00:32:17.981 --> 00:32:20.100
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then get yourself to start a few of</v>

729
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:23.500
<v Speaker 1>those actions and lock them in place so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can help you in any way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>something on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably have something on it or</v>

735
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:36.040
<v Speaker 1>get a product or don't do anything with</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

736
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:38.500
<v Speaker 1>but do something with somebody starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

737
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.410
<v Speaker 1>If you make the changes in yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be proud this year and</v>

738
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:46.220
<v Speaker 1>no amount of money or accolades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letter people can mirror the feeling of</v>

739
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:49.370
<v Speaker 1>being proud of knowing you've taken back</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of your life or you've taken a</v>

740
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:51.950
<v Speaker 1>great life to another level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because once you do that,</v>

741
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:53.390
<v Speaker 1>you have something you can give other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

742
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Would it be your kids and your friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your family?</v>

743
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.550
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately that's why it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So thanks for listening.</v>
