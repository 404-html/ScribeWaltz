<v Speaker 1>He is the journey of the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what determines the journey of</v>

2
00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:17.060
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had the feeling that your</v>

3
00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>mind is on a journey of voyage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of discovery,</v>

4
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.180
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes it has to make long</v>
<v Speaker 1>passages on dark,</v>

5
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>uncharted seas and at other times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovers bright islands of beauty or of</v>

6
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>truth I haven't zipped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll know from this day forward then it</v>

7
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:35.660
<v Speaker 1>can always steer for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find in a storm while they gales of</v>

8
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blow themselves out of me.</v>

9
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Enormous sees of misfortune or pain or</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorrow or doubt subside in the calm.</v>

10
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will come,</v>

11
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to take you with me on such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>voyage of the mind.</v>

12
00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:52.340
<v Speaker 1>That one that was charted for me many</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago by an obscure English editor</v>

13
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:57.341
<v Speaker 1>and poet named James Allen and a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>book called as a man Thinketh,</v>

14
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 1>that word you will hear essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>those of James Allen's as a man</v>

15
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 1>thinketh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought in character.</v>

16
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>The aphorism as a man thinketh in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>

17
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>so is he not only embraces the whole of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man's being,</v>

18
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but it's so comprehensive as to reach</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to every condition and circumstance</v>

19
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 1>of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A man is literally what he thinks.</v>

20
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>His character being the complete sum of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all his thoughts as the plant springs</v>

21
00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:37.060
<v Speaker 1>from and could not be without the seed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the acts of the man's spring from the</v>

22
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>hidden seeds of thought and could not</v>
<v Speaker 1>have appeared without them.</v>

23
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>The suppliers to those acts called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous and unpremeditated as well</v>

24
00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>as to those which are deliberately</v>
<v Speaker 1>executed.</v>

25
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Act is the blossom of thought and joy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and suffering are its fruits.</v>

26
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.510
<v Speaker 1>That's doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garner in the sweet and bitter footage</v>

27
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>of his own husbandry thought in the mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>have made us what we are by thought was</v>

28
00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>rock and built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a man is mine have evil thoughts,</v>

29
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.000
<v Speaker 1>pain comes on him as comes.</v>

30
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>That we only ox behind that if man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>deere is in purity of thought,</v>

31
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>joy follows him as his own shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure man grows by law,</v>

32
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 1>not by artifice and cause an effect on</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

33
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Absolute and I'm deviating and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden realm of thought as in the world</v>

34
00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:37.210
<v Speaker 1>of visible and material things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A noble character is not a thing of</v>

35
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:41.320
<v Speaker 1>favor or chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the natural result of continued</v>

36
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>effort and thought the effect of long</v>
<v Speaker 1>cherished association with high ideals</v>

37
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.510
<v Speaker 1>and ignoble and best Joel character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the same process as the result of</v>

38
00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:56.530
<v Speaker 1>the continued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heartbreak of grumbling thoughts man</v>

39
00:02:56.531 --> 00:03:01.531
<v Speaker 1>is made or unmade by</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the armory of thought.</v>

40
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>He forges the weapons by which he</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroys himself.</v>

41
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>He also patients the tools with which he</v>
<v Speaker 1>builds for himself.</v>

42
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Heavenly mentions of joy and strength</v>
<v Speaker 1>and peace made the right choice and true</v>

43
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:19.831
<v Speaker 1>application of thought man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a to our divine perfection by the abuse</v>

44
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>and wrong application of thought.</v>

45
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.660
<v Speaker 1>He descends below the level of the beast</v>
<v Speaker 1>between these two extremes are all the</v>

<v Speaker 1>of all the beautiful truth pertaining to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

48
00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>so all of which have been restored and</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought to light.</v>

49
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 1>None as mark broadening our food full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>divine promise and confidence than this.</v>

50
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.450
<v Speaker 1>That man is the master of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The motor of character and the maker and</v>

51
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>shaper of condition and environment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>destiny</v>

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>contains where they himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that transforming and regenerative</v>

<v Speaker 1>he wills.</v>

56
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Then as always the master,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Master who miss governs his household.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he begins to reflect upon his</v>

00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:42.781
<v Speaker 1>issues such as the conscious master and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then can only does become by discovering</v>

63
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 1>within himself the laws of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which discovery is totally a matter of</v>

00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>application,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self analysis and experience only by</v>

116
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:25.030
<v Speaker 1>whose faces drawn into inharmonious kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of two areas.</v>

117
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.460
<v Speaker 1>The one is the result of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even a sunny disposition.</v>

118
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Speaker 1>The others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outcome of bad temper and discontent</v>

119
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>as you cannot have a suite and wholesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>abode unless you admit the air and</v>

120
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 1>sunshine freely in the or rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a strong body and a bright,</v>

121
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serene condiments can only result from</v>

122
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:47.160
<v Speaker 1>my free admittance into the mind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

123
00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:52.161
<v Speaker 1>some joy and goodwill and serenity on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the faces of the age.</v>

124
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 1>There are wrinkles made by sympathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's by strong impure thought and</v>

125
00:08:57.061 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 1>others are carved by arrogance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment who cannot distinguish them,</v>

126
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>what those have lived thoughtfully.</v>

127
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Agent's calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful and softly mellow like the</v>

128
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 1>setting sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have recently seen a philosopher on</v>

129
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.370
<v Speaker 1>his death bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was not a old except in years he</v>

130
00:09:13.371 --> 00:09:14.270
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sweeper,</v>

131
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 1>he and peacefully as he's lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no physician like cheerful</v>

132
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.100
<v Speaker 1>thought for dissipating the ills of</v>
<v Speaker 1>malcontent.</v>

133
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.260
<v Speaker 1>There is a comparator to compare with</v>
<v Speaker 1>goodwill,</v>

134
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:30.210
<v Speaker 1>for dispersing the shadows of grief and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah to have continually in thoughts of</v>

135
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 1>ill will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cynicism,</v>

136
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 1>suspicion and mv is to be confined in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>self made me prison hall,</v>

137
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 1>but to think well of all to be cheerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all just patiently learned to find</v>

138
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:46.011
<v Speaker 1>the good in all is to live in sight of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very portals of heaven and they buy</v>

139
00:09:46.651 --> 00:09:50.330
<v Speaker 1>the thoughts of peace start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every creature will bring a bounding</v>

140
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.340
<v Speaker 1>piece to that possessor</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and circumstances,</v>

141
00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 1>a man's mind and maybe likened it to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>garden which may be intelligently</v>

142
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 1>cultivated or allowed to run wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes invaded or neglected,</v>

143
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 1>it must end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will bring forth.</v>

144
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.180
<v Speaker 1>If no useful seeds I put into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then an abundance of useless weed seeds</v>

145
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 1>will fall there and we'll continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce that kind of justice at.</v>

146
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Gardener cultivates his plot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping it free from weeds and growing</v>

147
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 1>the flowers and fruits which he</v>
<v Speaker 1>requires.</v>

148
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.620
<v Speaker 1>So many young men tend the garden of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

149
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.970
<v Speaker 1>We had all the wrong and useless</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and cultivating toward</v>

150
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:35.390
<v Speaker 1>perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flowers and fruits to ripe,</v>

151
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>useful and pure thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My pursuing this process,</v>

152
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:45.170
<v Speaker 1>a man sooner or later discovers that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the master gardener of his soul,</v>

153
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.490
<v Speaker 1>the director of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also reveals within himself the laws</v>

154
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 1>of thought and understands with ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing accuracy how his mind</v>

155
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 1>operates in the sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have his character,</v>

156
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.420
<v Speaker 1>circumstances and destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought and character are one and as</v>

157
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 1>character can only manifest and</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered itself to environment and</v>

158
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:11.010
<v Speaker 1>circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outer conditions of a person's life</v>

159
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 1>will always be found to be related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>his inner state.</v>

160
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.200
<v Speaker 1>This does not mean that a man of</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances at any given time or an</v>

161
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:23.370
<v Speaker 1>indication of his entire character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that those circumstances are so</v>

162
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.750
<v Speaker 1>intimately connected with some vital</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought within himself that for the time</v>

163
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>being they are indispensable to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

164
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Every man is where he is by the law of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his being.</v>

165
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.360
<v Speaker 1>The thoughts which he has built into his</v>
<v Speaker 1>character have brought him there and in</v>

166
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:43.440
<v Speaker 1>the arrangement of his life there is no</v>
<v Speaker 1>lasting element of champs,</v>

167
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.580
<v Speaker 1>but all is the result of a law which</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot bear.</v>

168
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 1>This is just as true of those who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>discontented with their surroundings as</v>

169
00:11:52.891 --> 00:11:57.891
<v Speaker 1>of those who are contented with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an evolving being man is where he is,</v>

170
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:03.871
<v Speaker 1>that he may learn that he may grow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he learns the lesson which any</v>

171
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 1>circumstance contains for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it passes away and give spice to other</v>

172
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

173
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Man is buffeted by circumstances so long</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he believes himself to be a creature</v>

174
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 1>and currently subject to outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>

175
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.240
<v Speaker 1>But when he realizes that he is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative power and that he made command</v>

176
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 1>the hidden soil and seeds of his being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to avoid circumstances grow,</v>

177
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.830
<v Speaker 1>he then becomes the right full master of</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself that circumstances grow out of</v>

178
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.050
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every man knows who has for any length</v>

179
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>

180
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 1>self control of his mind and thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>for he will live.</v>

181
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:43.891
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the alteration of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances has been an exact ratio</v>

182
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:47.970
<v Speaker 1>with is altered mental condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So true is this,</v>

183
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.970
<v Speaker 1>that when a man earnestly applies</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself to remedy the defects in his</v>

184
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:54.820
<v Speaker 1>character and make swift and mark the</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress,</v>

185
00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 1>he passes rapidly through a succession</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this institutes that so attracts</v>

186
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.860
<v Speaker 1>lack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is secretly hybrids,</v>

187
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 1>that which it loves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also that which it fears.</v>

188
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 1>It reaches the height of his cherished</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspirations.</v>

189
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:15.120
<v Speaker 1>It falls to the level of its unchaste</v>
<v Speaker 1>desires and circumstances are the means</v>

190
00:13:16.301 --> 00:13:21.301
<v Speaker 1>by which the soul receives its own and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought seeds sown are allowed to</v>

191
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:27.241
<v Speaker 1>fall into the mind and to take root</v>
<v Speaker 1>there producers a tone blossoming sooner</v>

192
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:30.210
<v Speaker 1>or later in the act and bearing its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

193
00:13:30.211 --> 00:13:33.250
<v Speaker 1>age of opportunity in circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thoughts,</v>

194
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 1>bear good fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad thoughts,</v>

195
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.150
<v Speaker 1>bad trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The outer world of circumstances shaped</v>

196
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.620
<v Speaker 1>by the inner world of thought and both</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasant and unpleasant external</v>

197
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:48.190
<v Speaker 1>conditions or factors which make for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate good of the individual.</v>

198
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.700
<v Speaker 1>As the reaper of his own harvest man</v>
<v Speaker 1>learns both by suffering and bliss</v>

199
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 1>following me in most desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspirations,</v>

200
00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:00.400
<v Speaker 1>thoughts by which he allows himself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be dominated,</v>

201
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 1>pursuing me will the West sort of vapor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the imaginings are steadfast.</v>

202
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 1>We walking the highway of strong and</v>
<v Speaker 1>high end ever a man at last arrives at</v>

203
00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:13.720
<v Speaker 1>their fruition and fulfillment in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outer conditions of his life.</v>

204
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.450
<v Speaker 1>The laws of growth and adjustment</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

205
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Obtain a man does not come to the arms</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

206
00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:24.280
<v Speaker 1>so the jail by the tyranny of fate or</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstance,</v>

207
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.720
<v Speaker 1>but by the pathway of grovelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and base desires,</v>

208
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:34.360
<v Speaker 1>nor does a high minded men fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the crime by stress am a mere</v>

209
00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:37.960
<v Speaker 1>external force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The criminal thoughts have long been</v>

210
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:41.770
<v Speaker 1>secretly fostered in the heart when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour of opportunity you'd be able to,</v>

211
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:46.000
<v Speaker 1>it's gathered power circumstance does</v>
<v Speaker 1>not make the man.</v>

212
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 1>It reveals</v>
<v Speaker 1>no such conditions can exist as</v>

213
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 1>defending and device and its attendant</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufferings apart from vicious</v>

214
00:14:55.761 --> 00:15:00.761
<v Speaker 1>inclinations or ascending into virtue</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's happiness without the continued</v>

215
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:06.101
<v Speaker 1>cultivation of virtuous aspirations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they have Laura as the Lord and</v>

216
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Master of thought is the maker of</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

217
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the shaper and author of environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The soul comes to its own.</v>

218
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Through every step of the jeffery</v>
<v Speaker 1>pilgrimage.</v>

219
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.850
<v Speaker 1>It attracts those combinations of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions which reveal itself,</v>

220
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Speaker 1>which are the reflections of its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue and vice.</v>

221
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:32.050
<v Speaker 1>It's strength and weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men did not attract that which they say</v>

222
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:37.310
<v Speaker 1>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that could stay are their whims</v>

223
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:40.220
<v Speaker 1>fancies and ambitions are taught it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At every step,</v>

224
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 1>but they're in most parts and desires</v>
<v Speaker 1>are fed with the food of their own</v>

225
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:47.420
<v Speaker 1>choosing the divinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chiefs,</v>

226
00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:52.421
<v Speaker 1>our ams is in ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is our very self man is manacle only</v>

227
00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:56.780
<v Speaker 1>by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought and action are the jailers of</v>

228
00:15:56.781 --> 00:16:00.650
<v Speaker 1>fate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They imprison being based that also the</v>

229
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:03.380
<v Speaker 1>angels of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They liberate being no book,</v>

230
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 1>not what he wishes him praise for it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man get,</v>

231
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.360
<v Speaker 1>but what he justly earns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His wishes and prayers are only</v>

232
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.380
<v Speaker 1>gratified and answered when they comport</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his thoughts and actions in the</v>

233
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Speaker 1>light of this truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What then is the meaning of fighting</v>

234
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:22.820
<v Speaker 1>against circumstances?</v>

235
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:28.220
<v Speaker 1>It means that a man has continually</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolting against an effect without wet</v>

236
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:31.010
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is nourishing and preserving its</v>

237
00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:35.390
<v Speaker 1>cause in his heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That caused me to take the form of a</v>

238
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.300
<v Speaker 1>conscious vice or an unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>weakness,</v>

239
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.930
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stubbornly returns the efforts of</v>

240
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:45.020
<v Speaker 1>its possessor and thus calls allowed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>remedy.</v>

241
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Men are anxious to improve their</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

242
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:52.730
<v Speaker 1>but are unwilling to improve themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They therefore remain bound,</v>

243
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 1>but names will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not shrink from self sacrifice,</v>

244
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.830
<v Speaker 1>can never fail to accomplish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The object upon which he was hard is</v>

245
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.630
<v Speaker 1>that this is as true of material as of</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual things.</v>

246
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Even the man who was so object is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquire wealth and must be prepared to</v>

247
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:13.790
<v Speaker 1>make great personal sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already can accomplish this object</v>

248
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.260
<v Speaker 1>and how much marcel he would realize a</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>

249
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:21.530
<v Speaker 1>joyful life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a man who is wretchedly poor,</v>

250
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.490
<v Speaker 1>is extremely anxious that his</v>
<v Speaker 1>surroundings and home comfort should be</v>

251
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:27.170
<v Speaker 1>improved it all the time.</v>

252
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.340
<v Speaker 1>He shirks his work and considers these</v>
<v Speaker 1>justified in trying to deceive his</v>

253
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:34.670
<v Speaker 1>employer on the ground of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>insufficiency of his wages.</v>

254
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Such a man does not understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplest rudiments of those principles,</v>

255
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:43.610
<v Speaker 1>which are the basis of true prosperity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's not only totally unfitted</v>

256
00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 1>derives out of his wretchedness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually attracting to himself</v>

257
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.760
<v Speaker 1>a student deeper wretchedness by</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwelling m and acting out in Dulles</v>

258
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:58.010
<v Speaker 1>deceptive and a memory thought he was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich man who was the victim of a painful</v>

259
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:01.780
<v Speaker 1>and persistent ill health as a result of</v>
<v Speaker 1>glutimate.</v>

260
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.010
<v Speaker 1>He's willing to give large sums of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get rid of it,</v>

261
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:10.200
<v Speaker 1>but he will not abandon his gluttony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to gratify his taste for rich</v>

262
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 1>and harmful volumes and have his health</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

263
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Such a man is totally unfit to have help</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he has not yet learned the first</v>

264
00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:19.680
<v Speaker 1>principles of a healthy life.</v>

265
00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Here's my employer of labor who adopts</v>
<v Speaker 1>crooked measures to avoid paying the</v>

266
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:28.200
<v Speaker 1>regulation wage and in the hope of</v>
<v Speaker 1>making larger profits.</v>

267
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.030
<v Speaker 1>We do says the wages of his work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people such a man as altogether unfitted</v>

268
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:37.720
<v Speaker 1>for prosperity and when he finds himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>bankrupt both as regards reputation and</v>

269
00:18:37.721 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 1>bridges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he blames circumstances not knowing that</v>

270
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:46.491
<v Speaker 1>he is the sole author of his condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've introduced these three cases nearly</v>

271
00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:50.300
<v Speaker 1>as illustrative of the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That man is the causer.</v>

272
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:55.580
<v Speaker 1>They'll nearly always unconscious way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his circumstances and that while aiming</v>

273
00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:59.550
<v Speaker 1>at a good and he may continually</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated it's accomplishment.</v>

274
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.330
<v Speaker 1>My thoughts and desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which cannot possibly harmonize with</v>

275
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:07.170
<v Speaker 1>that end in such cases could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplied in varied almost</v>

276
00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:10.440
<v Speaker 1>indefinitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not necessarily as you can</v>

277
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Speaker 1>if he still is the action of the laws of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought in your own mind in life.</v>

278
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this near external facts are not</v>

279
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:22.230
<v Speaker 1>likely to persuade you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Circumstances however,</v>

280
00:19:22.231 --> 00:19:25.590
<v Speaker 1>are so complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought is so deeply rooted in the</v>

281
00:19:25.591 --> 00:19:29.430
<v Speaker 1>conditions of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very so with individuals that a man's</v>

282
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.010
<v Speaker 1>entire condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it may be now under himself,</v>

283
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:36.000
<v Speaker 1>cannot be judged by another from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>external aspect of his life alone.</v>

284
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 1>A man may be honest in certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>

285
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 1>it's separate privations and man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they be dishonest in certain directions,</v>

286
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.250
<v Speaker 1>yet acquire wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conclusion usually formed however,</v>

287
00:19:47.251 --> 00:19:51.270
<v Speaker 1>that the one man fails because of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular honesty and that the other</v>

288
00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:55.240
<v Speaker 1>prospers because of his particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>dishonesty is the result of a</v>

289
00:19:55.241 --> 00:19:59.340
<v Speaker 1>superficial judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which assumes that the dishonest man is</v>

290
00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:04.341
<v Speaker 1>almost totally corrupt and the honest</v>
<v Speaker 1>man almost entirely virtuous in the</v>

291
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:06.780
<v Speaker 1>light of a deeper knowledge and wider</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

292
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Such judgment is found to be around</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

293
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 1>But dishonest man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have some admirable virtues which</v>

294
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:14.130
<v Speaker 1>the other does not possess.</v>

295
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.880
<v Speaker 1>And the honest man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obnoxious devices which are absent in</v>

296
00:20:17.881 --> 00:20:20.980
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The honest man rapes the good results.</v>

297
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.340
<v Speaker 1>So designers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and acts.</v>

298
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.050
<v Speaker 1>He also brings upon himself the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufferings,</v>

299
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.400
<v Speaker 1>which is vice's and the dishonest man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likewise,</v>

300
00:20:29.401 --> 00:20:34.401
<v Speaker 1>gun has his own sufferings and happiness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's pleasing the human vanity to</v>

301
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.050
<v Speaker 1>believe that one suffers because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's virtue,</v>

302
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.290
<v Speaker 1>but not have them tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A man has extubated every vicious,</v>

303
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:42.300
<v Speaker 1>bitter and resentful thought from his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

304
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Can he be in a position to know and</v>
<v Speaker 1>declare that his sufferings are the</v>

305
00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>result of is good and not of his</v>

306
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 2>bad qualities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on the way to yet long before it has</v>

307
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:56.110
<v Speaker 2>reached that supreme perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he will have found working in his mind</v>

308
00:20:56.111 --> 00:21:01.111
<v Speaker 2>in life the great law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is absolutely just in which cannot</v>

309
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:04.450
<v Speaker 2>therefore give good for evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil for good,</v>

310
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.990
<v Speaker 2>possessing such knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will then know,</v>

311
00:21:07.991 --> 00:21:12.991
<v Speaker 2>looking back upon this past ignorant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>blindness that his life is and always</v>

312
00:21:13.031 --> 00:21:17.470
<v Speaker 2>was justly ordered and that all his past</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

313
00:21:17.471 --> 00:21:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Good and bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the equitable outworking of his</v>

314
00:21:20.981 --> 00:21:25.981
<v Speaker 2>evolving yet unevolved good thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>actions can never in the long run and</v>

315
00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:30.820
<v Speaker 2>produce bad results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad thoughts and actions can never</v>

316
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:34.720
<v Speaker 2>produce good results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has been saying that nothing can</v>

317
00:21:34.721 --> 00:21:36.130
<v Speaker 2>come from corn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but corn,</v>

318
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.170
<v Speaker 2>nothing from metals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but metals.</v>

319
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Men understand this law and the natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and work with it,</v>

320
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.530
<v Speaker 2>but few understand it and the mental and</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral world though it's operation.</v>

321
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.310
<v Speaker 2>The hair is just as simple and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>deviating and they therefore do not</v>

322
00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:56.110
<v Speaker 2>cooperate with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mental suffering is always the effect of</v>

323
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.530
<v Speaker 2>error in some direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an indication that the</v>

324
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:02.050
<v Speaker 2>individual is out of harmony with</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>

325
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 2>with the law of his being the sole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm supreme you.</v>

326
00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:10.801
<v Speaker 2>So such suffering is to correct and</v>
<v Speaker 2>teach mental suffering ceases or him who</v>

327
00:22:11.051 --> 00:22:14.890
<v Speaker 2>was wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There can be no object burning gold</v>

328
00:22:14.891 --> 00:22:19.360
<v Speaker 2>after the drug has been removed and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind of a perfectly enlightened beings</v>

329
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.190
<v Speaker 2>cannot be agonized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The circumstances which Amanda</v>

330
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:27.250
<v Speaker 2>encounters with suffering of the result</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his own bleak outlook.</v>

331
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.600
<v Speaker 2>The circumstances which amendment</v>
<v Speaker 2>counters with blessedness or again the</v>

332
00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 2>result of his own aptitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blessedness,</v>

333
00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:40.300
<v Speaker 2>not material possessions is the measure</v>
<v Speaker 2>of right wretchedness,</v>

334
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.560
<v Speaker 2>not the lack of material possessions is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the major of wrong.</v>

335
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.560
<v Speaker 2>A man may be cursed and rich.</v>

336
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.100
<v Speaker 2>He may be blessed and poor blessedness</v>
<v Speaker 2>and enriches only join together when the</v>

337
00:22:54.941 --> 00:22:59.941
<v Speaker 2>richards or wisely used and the poor man</v>
<v Speaker 2>old me descends into wretchedness when</v>

338
00:22:59.951 --> 00:23:04.951
<v Speaker 2>he regards his life as a Britain</v>
<v Speaker 2>unjustly imposed in the gym.</v>

339
00:23:05.231 --> 00:23:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Some indulgence are the two extremes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wretchedness.</v>

340
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.970
<v Speaker 2>They're both equally unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A man is not rightly conditioned until</v>

341
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 2>he's a happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>

342
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.640
<v Speaker 2>and prosperous being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And happiness.</v>

343

<v Speaker 2>The walls of granite intervene be not</v>
<v Speaker 2>impatient in delay,</v>

414
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:12.630

<v Speaker 2>the Gods are ready to obey</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought purpose and achievement</v>

416
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.680
<v Speaker 2>until thought is linked with purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no intelligent accomplishment</v>

417
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.140
<v Speaker 2>with the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The park daughters allowed to drift upon</v>

418
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:33.750
<v Speaker 2>the ocean of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aimlessness is advice and such.</v>

419
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Drifting must not continue for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would steer clear of catastrophe and</v>

420
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.860
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They who have no central purpose in</v>

421
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:44.070
<v Speaker 2>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>following easy prey to petty worries,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>troubles himself could headings,</v>

423
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.960
<v Speaker 2>all of which are indications of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness,</v>

424
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.880
<v Speaker 2>which lean just to Shirley is deliberate</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrongdoing by a different route to</v>

425
00:28:53.881 --> 00:28:57.480
<v Speaker 2>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unhappiness and loss for weakness cannot</v>

426
00:28:57.481 --> 00:29:00.420
<v Speaker 2>persist in a power evolving universe.</v>

427
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:05.880
<v Speaker 2>A man should conceive of a worthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose in his heart and set up to</v>

428
00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:08.250
<v Speaker 2>accomplish it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should make this purpose the</v>

429
00:29:08.251 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 2>centralizing point of his thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may take the form of a spiritual</v>

430
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:16.620
<v Speaker 2>ideal or it may be a worldly object</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to his nature at the time,</v>

431
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.700
<v Speaker 2>but whichever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should have steadfastly focused his</v>

432
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:23.190
<v Speaker 2>thoughts upon the object which he has</v>
<v Speaker 2>set before him.</v>

433
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 2>He should make this purpose is supreme</v>
<v Speaker 2>duty and should devote himself to its</v>

434
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:31.230
<v Speaker 2>attainment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not allowing his thoughts to wander away</v>

435
00:29:31.231 --> 00:29:36.231
<v Speaker 2>and the vague and if female offenses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the royal road to self control</v>

436
00:29:37.231 --> 00:29:41.130
<v Speaker 2>and true concentration of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if he fails again,</v>

437
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.880
<v Speaker 2>again to accomplish his purpose as he</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily master drove weaknesses,</v>

438
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.780
<v Speaker 2>overcome the spring third character he</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams will be the measure of its true</v>

439
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:54.160
<v Speaker 2>success and this will form a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting point for future power and</v>

440
00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:54.994
<v Speaker 2>tramp.</v>

441
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Those who are not prepared to conceive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dedicate themselves to a great</v>

442
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 2>purpose should fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thoughts upon the fault was performance</v>

443
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:05.950
<v Speaker 2>of their beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter how significant bed tasks may</v>

444
00:30:05.951 --> 00:30:09.130
<v Speaker 2>appear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only in his wake and the thoughts began</v>

445
00:30:09.131 --> 00:30:12.670
<v Speaker 2>there and focused and resolution that</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy be developed,</v>

446
00:30:12.671 --> 00:30:16.450
<v Speaker 2>which being done there is nothing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>may not be accomplished.</v>

447
00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:21.370
<v Speaker 2>The weakest will knowing its own</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness and believing this truth,</v>

448
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.060
<v Speaker 2>that strength can only be developed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort in practice,</v>

449
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.360
<v Speaker 2>will thus believing at once begin to</v>
<v Speaker 2>exert itself and add the effort,</v>

450
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 2>effort patients to patients from</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength to strength will never cease to</v>

451
00:30:35.321 --> 00:30:40.321
<v Speaker 2>develop and will it last grow strong as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the physically weak man can make himself</v>

452
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:46.360
<v Speaker 2>strong by careful impatient exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the man and we thought it can become</v>

453
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:51.361
<v Speaker 2>strong by training himself in thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to put away aimlessness and weakness and</v>

454
00:30:51.881 --> 00:30:56.570
<v Speaker 2>to begin this think with purpose is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>enter the ranks of those strong ones who</v>

455
00:30:56.571 --> 00:31:01.571
<v Speaker 2>only recognize failure as one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway is to attain them who make all</v>

456
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.080
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serve them and do things strongly</v>

457
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:09.130
<v Speaker 2>attempt fearlessly and accomplish</v>
<v Speaker 2>masterfully.</v>

458
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Having conceived of his purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man should prudently mark out a</v>

459
00:31:14.531 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 2>straight pathway to its achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looking neither to the right nor the</v>

460
00:31:18.341 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 2>left doubts and fears should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>rigorously excluded.</v>

461
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.160
<v Speaker 2>They are disintegrating elements which</v>
<v Speaker 2>break up the straight line of effort,</v>

462
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.530
<v Speaker 2>rendering it crooked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ineffectual,</v>

463
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:34.300
<v Speaker 2>useless thoughts of doubt and fear never</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished anything and never cam.</v>

464
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:39.520
<v Speaker 2>They always lead to failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose them energy or weakened when</v>

465
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:44.521
<v Speaker 2>doubt and fear creeping up the will to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do springs to my knowledge that we can</v>

466
00:31:45.671 --> 00:31:50.400
<v Speaker 2>do doubt and fear of the great enemies</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this knowledge and he would encourage</v>

467
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:55.410
<v Speaker 2>them forts himself at every step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He who has conquered doubt and fear has</v>

468
00:31:56.531 --> 00:32:00.250
<v Speaker 2>conquered failure is every thought is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fraught with power,</v>

469
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.320
<v Speaker 2>is difficulties wisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bravely met an overcoat is purposes or</v>

00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:10.150
<v Speaker 2>seasonably planted and the boom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring forth fruit which does not fall</v>

471
00:32:10.151 --> 00:32:15.151
<v Speaker 2>prematurely to the ground thought allied</v>
<v Speaker 2>fearlessly to purpose becomes creative</v>

472
00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:19.114
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

473
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:23.820
<v Speaker 2>He who knows this is ready to become</v>
<v Speaker 2>something higher and stronger than a</v>

474
00:32:23.821 --> 00:32:27.850
<v Speaker 2>mere bundle of wavering thoughts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fluctuating sensations.</v>

475
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.610
<v Speaker 2>He who does this has become the</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious and intelligent wielder of his</v>

476
00:32:33.611 --> 00:32:38.611
<v Speaker 2>mental powers</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the amount of cheese at all he</v>

477
00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:44.321
<v Speaker 2>fails to achieve is the direct result of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his own thoughts and adjust the ordered</v>

478
00:32:45.261 --> 00:32:48.350
<v Speaker 2>universe where loss of repose means</v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction.</v>

479
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Individual responsibility must be</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute a man's weakness and strength,</v>

480
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:59.030
<v Speaker 2>wisdom and follow his own right and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>another man.</v>

481
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.350
<v Speaker 2>They have a product of himself and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

482
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.220
<v Speaker 2>and they can only be ordered by himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never buy another is circumstances also</v>

483
00:33:11.721 --> 00:33:16.100
<v Speaker 2>on his own and not another man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His suffering and his happiness,</v>

484
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:20.150
<v Speaker 2>we evolved from within as he thinks so</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he.</v>

485
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.840
<v Speaker 2>As he continues to think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he remains</v>

486
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.040
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man cannot help a weaker unless the</v>

487
00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:30.980
<v Speaker 2>weaker is willing to be helped and even</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that week,</v>

488
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:32.750
<v Speaker 2>man must become strong of himself.</v>

489
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.790
<v Speaker 2>He must by his own efforts develop the</v>
<v Speaker 2>strength which he admires and another</v>

490
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.450
<v Speaker 2>none but himself can alter his</v>
<v Speaker 2>condition.</v>

491
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:47.450
<v Speaker 2>It has been unusual for Amanda thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say many men are slaves because one</v>

492
00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:50.120
<v Speaker 2>is an oppressor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let us hate the oppressor.</v>

493
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a Mayan increasing few,</v>

494
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:58.331
<v Speaker 2>a tendency to reverse this judgment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say one man is an oppressor because</v>

495
00:33:59.271 --> 00:34:03.500
<v Speaker 2>many are slaves that has despised the</v>
<v Speaker 2>slaves.</v>

496
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that a presser and Suede,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our cooperators and ignorance and the</v>

497
00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Yoc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean to reflect each other in reality</v>

498
00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 2>of the funeral was out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

499
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Perfect knowledge precedes the action of</v>
<v Speaker 2>law and the weakness of the oppressed</v>

500
00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.630
<v Speaker 2>and the misapplied power of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressor.</v>

501
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:26.000
<v Speaker 2>A perfect love seeing the suffering</v>
<v Speaker 2>which both states and tail condemns</v>

502
00:34:26.001 --> 00:34:31.001
<v Speaker 2>neither a perfect compassion and basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both oppressor and oppressed eus</v>

503
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:35.870
<v Speaker 2>conquered weakness and has put away</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfish thoughts,</v>

504
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:39.020
<v Speaker 2>belongs neither to oppress her nor</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressed.</v>

505
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.670
<v Speaker 2>He has free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A man can only rise,</v>

506
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 2>conquer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and achieve.</v>

507
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:51.010
<v Speaker 2>By lifting up his thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can only remain weak and object and</v>

508
00:34:51.141 --> 00:34:54.340
<v Speaker 2>miserable by refusing to lift up his</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts</v>

509
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:59.690
<v Speaker 2>before Amanda can achieve anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the world if things he must lift</v>

510
00:34:59.691 --> 00:35:04.220
<v Speaker 2>his thoughts above the animal level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he may not in order to succeed,</v>

511
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.160
<v Speaker 2>give up all an amount of ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Selfish does by any means,</v>

512
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:10.490
<v Speaker 2>but a portion of it at least must be</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrificed.</v>

513
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.290
<v Speaker 2>A man who was Chris' daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self indulgence can either think clearly</v>

514
00:35:15.291 --> 00:35:17.880
<v Speaker 2>and our plan methodically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he cannot find them.</v>

515
00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:19.790
<v Speaker 2>Developers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lakeland grease sources,</v>

516
00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:24.710
<v Speaker 2>and I must fail in any undertaking I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>having commenced from men from eight to</v>

517
00:35:24.711 --> 00:35:27.740
<v Speaker 2>control his thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not in a position to control</v>

518
00:35:27.741 --> 00:35:30.170
<v Speaker 2>affairs and to adopt serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities.</v>

519
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.800
<v Speaker 2>He's not fed to act independently in</v>
<v Speaker 2>standalone.</v>

520
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.160
<v Speaker 2>He's limited by the thoughts where she</v>
<v Speaker 2>chooses.</v>

521
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.390
<v Speaker 2>There can be no progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no achievement without sacrifice and a</v>

522
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:46.920
<v Speaker 2>man's worldly success will be in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>measure that he sacrifices his confused</v>

523
00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:52.020
<v Speaker 2>animal thoughts and fixes his mind on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the development of this plans and the</v>

524
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 2>strengthening of his resolution and self</v>
<v Speaker 2>reliance and the higher he lifts his</v>

525
00:35:56.551 --> 00:35:59.370
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more manly and upright he becomes.</v>

526
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.660
<v Speaker 2>The greater will be his success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more blessed than enduring will be</v>

527
00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:08.310
<v Speaker 2>as achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The universe does not favor the greedy,</v>

528
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.850
<v Speaker 2>the dishonest the fishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although on the mirror surface it may</v>

529
00:36:11.851 --> 00:36:15.090
<v Speaker 2>sometimes appear to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's continuing.</v>

530
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.700
<v Speaker 2>A Beckman is what the honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magnanimous,</v>

531
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.400
<v Speaker 2>the virtuous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the great teachers,</v>

532
00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.180
<v Speaker 2>the ages have declared this and varying</v>
<v Speaker 2>forms and approve and know it.</v>

533
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 2>A man has been to persist and lifting up</v>
<v Speaker 2>his thoughts.</v>

534
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Intellectual achievements are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>results of thought consecrated to the</v>

535
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:35.970
<v Speaker 2>search for knowledge or for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful and true in life and nature.</v>

536
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Such achievements maybe sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected with vanity and ambition,</v>

537
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.270
<v Speaker 2>but they're not the outcome of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics.</v>

538
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:47.790
<v Speaker 2>They have a natural outgrowth of long</v>
<v Speaker 2>and arduous effort and arduous searching</v>

539
00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:51.030
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spiritual achievement is the</v>

540
00:36:51.031 --> 00:36:55.050
<v Speaker 2>consummation of aspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He who lives constantly and the</v>

541
00:36:55.051 --> 00:36:58.650
<v Speaker 2>conception of wise and noble thoughts or</v>
<v Speaker 2>dwellings dwells upon all that is</v>

542
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.200
<v Speaker 2>elevating and himself as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As surely as this time reaches it's Dean</v>

543
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:06.060
<v Speaker 2>and the moon,</v>

544
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.510
<v Speaker 2>and rise into a position of wisdom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>blessedness,</v>

545
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 2>achievement of whatever kind is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crown of effort,</v>

546
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.760
<v Speaker 2>the diadem of thought by self control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resolution at auditions and well</v>

547
00:37:22.081 --> 00:37:27.081
<v Speaker 2>directed thought a man sm by an amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the endurance,</v>

548
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.560
<v Speaker 2>corruption and confusion of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amen.</v>

551
00:37:37.611 --> 00:37:41.880
<v Speaker 2>spiritual realm and again descend into</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness and wretchedness by allowing</v>

552
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.380
<v Speaker 2>arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfish,</v>

553
00:37:43.381 --> 00:37:45.180
<v Speaker 2>and corrupt thoughts to take possession</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

554
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:50.340
<v Speaker 2>The victory is attained by thought can</v>
<v Speaker 2>only be maintained by watchfulness many</v>

555
00:37:50.341 --> 00:37:54.330
<v Speaker 2>giveaway when success is assured and</v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly fall back into failure.</v>

<v Speaker 2>intellectual or spiritual world is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>result of definitely directed thought is</v>

558
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:05.850
<v Speaker 2>governed by the same law and dependent</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon the same method.</v>

559
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:09.350
<v Speaker 2>The only difference lies in the object</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a payment.</v>

560
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.550
<v Speaker 2>He who had accomplished little needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice level II who would achieve</v>

<v Speaker 2>It lives in the moment it feels in them.</v>

568
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.700
<v Speaker 2>The reality is which it shower one day.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and labor confined long hours in an</v>

601
00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:17.350
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy workshop unschooled and</v>
<v Speaker 2>lacking all the arts,</v>

602
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:21.700
<v Speaker 2>but he brings a better things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks of intelligence,</v>

603
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 2>of refinements,</v>

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:32.490
<v Speaker 2>The vision of a wider liberty and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>larger scope takes possession of it.</v>

606
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Unrest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>urges him to action and he utilizes all</v>

607
00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 2>his time and means small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low.</v>

608
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:43.211
<v Speaker 2>They are to the development of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>latent powers and resources very soon so</v>

609
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 2>altered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has his mind become that the workshop</v>

610
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:50.990
<v Speaker 2>can no longer hold him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has become so out of harmony with his</v>

611
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:55.991
<v Speaker 2>mentality that it falls out of his life</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a garment is cast aside and with the</v>

612

<v Speaker 2>growth of opportunities which fit the</v>

<v Speaker 2>and almost unequal power in his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He holds the cards of gigantic</v>

617
00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:19.940
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He speaks and low lives are changed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Men and women hang up on his words and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we mold their characters and the</v>

619
00:42:24.531 --> 00:42:27.930
<v Speaker 2>sunlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes the fixed and Illumina cetera</v>

<v Speaker 2>revolves.</v>

621
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.440
<v Speaker 2>He has realized that vision of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>youth,</v>

<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

<v Speaker 2>controlling desire,</v>

632
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:19.810
<v Speaker 2>as great as your dominant aspiration in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beautiful words of stamp and Davis.</v>

<v Speaker 2>still behind your ear,</v>

636
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:37.300
<v Speaker 2>the ink stains on your fingers and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there shall pour out the torrent of</v>

<v Speaker 2>wander to the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you call like an open mouth shall</v>

639
00:43:44.061 --> 00:43:48.230

<v Speaker 2>into the studio of a master.</v>

640
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:50.330
<v Speaker 2>And after a time he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll say,</v>

<v Speaker 2>did so recently dream of great things</v>
<v Speaker 2>while driving sheep,</v>

643
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:03.050
<v Speaker 2>the thoughtless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ignorant and the indolent,</v>

644
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.750
<v Speaker 2>seeing only the apparent effects of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and not the things themselves.</v>

645
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Talk of luck or fortune and chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing a man grow rich.</v>

649
00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:30.950
<v Speaker 2>every turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do not see that trials and failures</v>

650
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.830
<v Speaker 2>and struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which these men have voluntary and</v>

651
00:44:33.831 --> 00:44:36.360
<v Speaker 2>counted in order to gain their</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

652
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:38.790
<v Speaker 2>They have no knowledge of this tech</v>
<v Speaker 2>advice.</v>

653
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.250
<v Speaker 2>If they have made of the undaunted</v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts,</v>

654
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:45.300

<v Speaker 2>They have exercised that they might</v>

655
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:49.710
<v Speaker 2>overcome the apparently insurmountable</v>
<v Speaker 2>and realize the vision of their heart.</v>

656
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.860
<v Speaker 2>They do not know the darkness and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>heartaches.</v>

657
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 2>They only see the light and joy and call</v>
<v Speaker 2>it luck.</v>

658
00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:59.700
<v Speaker 2>They do not have to see the long and</v>
<v Speaker 2>arduous journey but only behold the</v>

659
00:44:59.701 --> 00:45:02.070
<v Speaker 2>present gold and call it good fortune.</v>

660
00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.920
<v Speaker 2>They do not understand the process but</v>
<v Speaker 2>only perceived the result and call it a</v>

661
00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.280
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In all of human affairs,</v>

663
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:21.120
<v Speaker 2>measure of the result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chance is not gifts,</v>

664

<v Speaker 2>powers,</v>

<v Speaker 2>intellectual and spiritual possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other fruits of effort.</v>

666
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:30.780
<v Speaker 2>They are thoughts completed objects,</v>

<v Speaker 2>effort in self control.</v>

672
00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.380

<v Speaker 2>experience and of a more than ordinary</v>

685
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Even the most ordinary trader will find</v>
<v Speaker 2>his business.</v>

686
00:46:58.171 --> 00:47:03.171
<v Speaker 2>Prosperity increases as he develops a</v>
<v Speaker 2>greater self control and equanimity or</v>

687
00:47:04.001 --> 00:47:08.400
<v Speaker 2>people will always prefer to deal with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>man who's demeanor is strongly equable.</v>

688
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.020
<v Speaker 2>The strong common man has always loved</v>
<v Speaker 2>and revered.</v>

689
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:18.270
<v Speaker 2>It was like a shade giving tree and at</v>
<v Speaker 2>first thirsty land or a sheltering rock</v>

690
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.930
<v Speaker 2>in the storm who does not love a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tranquil heart,</v>

691
00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.600
<v Speaker 2>a sweet tempered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>balanced life.</v>

692
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:29.560
<v Speaker 2>It does not matter whether it rains or</v>
<v Speaker 2>shines or what changes come to those</v>

693
00:47:29.561 --> 00:47:33.190
<v Speaker 2>possessing these blessings go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always cheerful,</v>

694
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 2>poised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm.</v>

695
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:41.050
<v Speaker 2>That exquisite poison oak character</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we call serenity is the last</v>

696
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.460
<v Speaker 2>lesson of culture.</v>

697
00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 2>It is the flowering of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the footage of the soul.</v>

698
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:50.500
<v Speaker 2>It is precious wisdom more to be desired</v>
<v Speaker 2>than gold,</v>

699
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:55.030
<v Speaker 2>even fine gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How insignificant mere money looks in</v>

700
00:47:55.031 --> 00:48:00.031
<v Speaker 2>comparison with a serenely joyous life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a life that dwells in the ocean of truth</v>

701
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.240
<v Speaker 2>beyond the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the reach of tempest in the</v>

702
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:09.130
<v Speaker 2>blesser town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people we know who sour their</v>

703
00:48:09.131 --> 00:48:12.280
<v Speaker 2>lives were ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that is sweet and beautiful by</v>

704
00:48:12.281 --> 00:48:17.281
<v Speaker 2>explosive temporaries who destroy their</v>
<v Speaker 2>poise of character and make ill will.</v>

705
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:22.060
<v Speaker 2>It is a question whether the great</v>
<v Speaker 2>majority of people do not ruin their</v>

706
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:25.630
<v Speaker 2>lives and mother happiness by lack of</v>
<v Speaker 2>self control.</v>

707
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.630
<v Speaker 2>How few people we meet in my life who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are well balanced,</v>

708
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:34.420
<v Speaker 2>who have the exquisite poise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is characteristic of the finished</v>

709
00:48:34.421 --> 00:48:36.470
<v Speaker 2>press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

710
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:40.000
<v Speaker 2>Humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sturges with uncontrolled emotion is to</v>

711
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Mulch us with ungoverned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grief is blown about by anxiety and</v>

712
00:48:44.161 --> 00:48:49.161
<v Speaker 2>about only the wise man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only he whose thoughts are controlled</v>

713
00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:54.660
<v Speaker 2>makes the winds and the storms are bay</v>
<v Speaker 2>tempest tossed souls,</v>

714
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.540
<v Speaker 2>whatever you may be under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the weather conditions he may</v>

715
00:48:58.541 --> 00:49:02.500
<v Speaker 2>live no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This in the ocean of life,</v>

716
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 2>the isles of blessedness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a smiling and the sunny shore of your</v>

717
00:49:07.151 --> 00:49:08.740
<v Speaker 2>ideal weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're coming.</v>

718
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Keep your hand firmly upon the helm of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought in the bark of your soul</v>

719
00:49:14.561 --> 00:49:17.950
<v Speaker 2>requires the commanding master.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does asleep.</v>

720
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Wake him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Self control is strength.</v>

721
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Thought is mastery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calmness is power.</v>

722
