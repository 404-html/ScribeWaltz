00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Are complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are making excuses and we do it</v>

2
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>everyday because it feels a lot better</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shit on somebody else.</v>

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Then look at yourself and shit on</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>whether it's one man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at anybody else.</v>

6
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>I have no fucking idea what you guys are</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to and I shit on myself every day.</v>

7
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I critique everything I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is my fault.</v>

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>End of story.</v>

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I can sit and dwell on all the things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody hits me with a fucking car</v>

10
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.621
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

11
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have left the house that</v>

12
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:47.091
<v Speaker 1>early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get into that fucking mindset.</v>

13
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I promise you shit changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to fucking suffocate your</v>

14
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're at this conference.</v>

15
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>That means you need to suffocate your</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit period.</v>

16
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Either need to figure out who's holding</v>
<v Speaker 1>you back and their judgment and go to</v>

17
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to get out of this fucking</v>

18
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to your car or call your mom and say</v>

19
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.044
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

20
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 2>She's</v>

21
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>the person that is suppressing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she's miserable and misery loves</v>

22
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being dead serious with you.</v>

23
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I understand it's not a popular thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

24
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's only a couple of things that</v>

25
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing in the world today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is people aren't doing things</v>

26
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>because they're fearful of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's judgments,</v>

27
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>which usually comes from parenting or</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment or circumstance,</v>

28
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>and they're still keeping negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy around them because they're</v>

29
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>obligated and I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have negative people in my life too</v>

30
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>that I keep around as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to let that dictate your only life</v>

31
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.580
<v Speaker 1>is fucking ludicrous and all I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about,</v>

32
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>let me actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

33
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you a real weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want every person to do me a huge</v>

34
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to know what's</v>

35
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>running through my fucking body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go volunteer at a nursing home for one</v>

36
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:51.894
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

37
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Go volunteer at a nursing home for one</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

38
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a nice thing to do and you'll</v>

39
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 1>probably feel pretty awesome about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

40
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>don't talk to eight people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>

41
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see something that is</v>

42
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.120
<v Speaker 1>going to scare the living shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

43
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 1>It's called regret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regret,</v>

44
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 1>scares the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regret is the fuel besides gratitude</v>

45
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>that drives my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will see people and they will tell</v>

46
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>you things about the things they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and the silliness to why they didn't</v>

47
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>do it and they're running out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sit in this room and you have time.</v>

48
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>You have time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're 70 80 90 of time,</v>

49
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>if you're 15 you've time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to sit and list all the reasons you</v>

50
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

51
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>here's how I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anybody that looks like you has ever</v>

52
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can too.</v>

53
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if some kid that grew up with two</v>

54
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and grew up in an orphanage made</v>

55
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can too.</v>

56
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in luck or circumstance.</v>

57
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I believe in all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

58
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I understand that this is not about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

59
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>It's about mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second you start having losing</v>

60
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've already fucking lost.</v>

61
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I love when people think shit like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>secret is real fucking real.</v>

62
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friends.</v>

63
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>If you actually are optimistic and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a goal and your actions map to it,</v>

64
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>you've miraculously get somewhere close</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

65
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Sitting on your couch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerking off and saying,</v>

66
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had $1 million.</v>

67
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.200
<v Speaker 1>The amount of people talking big game in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this office,</v>

68
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.110
<v Speaker 1>in this room office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly I use that a lot.</v>

69
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.700
<v Speaker 1>The amount of people talking big game at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this conference right now where their</v>

70
00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:44.390
<v Speaker 1>ambitions don't match their actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people rolling around here and</v>

71
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:48.110
<v Speaker 1>say they're going to make 100 million a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and then take the whole weekend</v>

72
00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:50.030
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I have nothing going for themselves</v>

73
00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:52.880
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know quiet my head is,</v>

74
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.740
<v Speaker 1>do you know how quiet my head is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My head is soup.</v>

75
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.070
<v Speaker 1>It is super quiet in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why no voices allowed.</v>

76
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.600
<v Speaker 1>No voices allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not My wife's,</v>

77
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.060
<v Speaker 1>not my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not my business partners,</v>

78
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.470
<v Speaker 1>not my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

79
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm in it for me in my own mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason I can give so much to</v>

80
00:04:13.581 --> 00:04:16.250
<v Speaker 1>everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because I'm good because I made it</v>

81
00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:17.810
<v Speaker 1>with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>

82
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.823
<v Speaker 1>End of story</v>

83
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>and I've been talking about a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and the reason I'm going further</v>

84
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 1>down this rabbit hole of tuned out</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else is as I've gotten to know</v>

85
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

86
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>they're scared because their partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes fun of them all the time.</v>

87
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just very basic behavior,</v>

88
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very basic behavior and so I just</v>

89

90
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:49.180

<v Speaker 1>The odds of being in this fucking room</v>

91
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:54.181
<v Speaker 1>right now is 400 trillion to one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that your mom and dad had sex</v>

92
00:04:55.491 --> 00:05:00.491

<v Speaker 1>the email that you send me in six years</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this suffocating conversation.</v>

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 1>A festival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figure out something you believe in</v>

119
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>that you sell and then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number three,</v>

120
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to let the world know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it at the lowest possible cost.</v>

121
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's under 30 year olds,</v>

122
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.920

<v Speaker 1>snapchat ads.</v>

123
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:28.060
<v Speaker 1>They're $3 CPMS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody writes off snapchat because</v>

124
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>instagram copies all its features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly when I went all in on</v>

125
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>snapchat the last three months and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying awareness at a price I've never</v>

<v Speaker 1>seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the person is under 30</v>
