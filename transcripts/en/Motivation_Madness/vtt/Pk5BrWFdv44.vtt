1
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>I had so many dreams of where I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go,</v>

2
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>who I want it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I wanted to do.</v>

3
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Theater companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to start with classmates,</v>

4
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be in directors.</v>

5
00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to work with stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it to tell,</v>

6
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 1>it might take a little time I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would happen</v>

7
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 1>when I sat there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

8
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.980
<v Speaker 1>22 years ago.</v>

9
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>What I didn't want to think about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I would be tomorrow,</v>

11
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>what I would have to start to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

12
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>And I graduated in 1991 a great year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:04.951
<v Speaker 1>time of resurgence for independent films</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country at a time of relatively</v>

14
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>affordable rents in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

15
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I assumed that I could make a living</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing my place,</v>

16
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 1>acting way off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

17
00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:22.561
<v Speaker 1>off Broadway and hopefully one day join</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actors I loved and respected in</v>

18
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>those independent films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>

19
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

20
00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:27.551
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

21
00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:28.384
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

22
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even consider that I have much</v>

24
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Speaker 1>more class than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much more self respect than that.</v>

25
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Soap operas and ship.</v>

26
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 1>What I didn't have was cash</v>

27
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 2>a bank account,</v>

28
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.380
<v Speaker 1>credit card or an apartment.</v>

29
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I just had debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

30
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

31
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>growing larger every moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Debt,</v>

32
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>so as you will tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to leave beautiful Vermont.</v>

33
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I pack the life that I knew with socks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a toothbrush into my backpack and I</v>

34
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:34.581
<v Speaker 1>slept on couch after couch after couch</v>
<v Speaker 1>after couch at friend's apartments in</v>

35
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>New York until I wore out their rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pang roommates welcome.</v>

36
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want a day job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an actor.</v>

37
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 1>I was a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at Bennington graduate.</v>

38
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>I had to get a day job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dusted pianos at a piano store on</v>

39
00:02:55.901 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>ludlow street for five months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked on the property of a</v>

40
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare scholar for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling weeds and removing bees nests.</v>

41
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I went on unemployment ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for not for long.</v>

42
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:13.681
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't handle the guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually I was able to pay rent for a</v>

43
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>spot on the floor of an apartment on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower east side,</v>

44
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>but my roommate had a breakdown and</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

45
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.130
<v Speaker 1>He later resurfaced in a religious cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making this sound romantic.</v>

46
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.470
<v Speaker 1>It really wasn't it.</v>

47
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

48
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I helped hang paintings at galleries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paintings.</v>

49
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>That inspired inspire you to think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do that.</v>

50
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

51
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.760
<v Speaker 1>and then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after two years of job and couch</v>

52
00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:01.560
<v Speaker 1>surfing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>six years</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer than my time at Benning</v>

<v Speaker 1>I smoked in the loading docks with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys from the mail room and we shared</v>

62
00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:52.020
<v Speaker 1>how hung over.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

69
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I called in sick almost every Friday</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was out late the night before.</v>

70
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I hated that job and I clung to that job</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that job.</v>

71
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I could afford my own place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I lived in Williamsburg.</v>

72
00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:27.641
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

73
00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:32.991
<v Speaker 1>You say that now</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kingdom for a time machine.</v>

74
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.023
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

75
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

76
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:45.991
<v Speaker 1>I lived in an industrial loft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My rent was $400 a month.</v>

77
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.970
<v Speaker 1>My dream of running a theater company</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my friend,</v>

78
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>fellow Bennington graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian Bell had died.</v>

79
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I won't go into those details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but neither one of us had any business</v>

80
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the theater we lived in,</v>

81
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>it had no heat or hot water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't smell very good,</v>

82
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>but we had our youth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The youth gets old very quickly.</v>

83
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.140
<v Speaker 1>You'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Ian moved out to Seattle and I moved</v>

84
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:25.870
<v Speaker 1>up to the street to my loft and I still</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have heat</v>

85
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.370
<v Speaker 1>in 1993 industrial loft men not legal to</v>
<v Speaker 1>live there.</v>

86
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this to sound cool and I</v>

87
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:40.750
<v Speaker 1>feel like it's sending cool</v>

88
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.823
<v Speaker 2>ad Lib.</v>

89
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did have hot water,</v>

90
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>hot water in my bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a friend of mine using said</v>

91
00:06:56.111 --> 00:06:59.770
<v Speaker 1>bathroom once shouted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It smells exactly like a summer camp in</v>

92
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:00.280
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

93
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.113
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

94
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.280
<v Speaker 1>It was true for some reason in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of Brooklyn,</v>

95
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.550
<v Speaker 1>there was earth in my shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure Earth and then,</v>

96
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.570
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms growing from the earth.</v>

97
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.430
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was safe though.</v>

98
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.080
<v Speaker 1>The ideal fire control company was right</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the street where they make all</v>

99
00:07:25.081 --> 00:07:27.090
<v Speaker 1>the chemicals that put out chemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>fires.</v>

100
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I did not fear a chemical fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be okay.</v>

101
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.370
<v Speaker 1>And all those chemicals in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're okay too because up the street we</v>

102
00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:42.390
<v Speaker 1>had the spice factory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made spices and that just covered</v>

103
00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:47.391
<v Speaker 1>everything up in a nice cumins centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a rat,</v>

104
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 1>but that was okay cause I got a cat.</v>

105
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

106
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.660
<v Speaker 1>his name was Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No relation.</v>

107
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.310
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother had given me a pink</v>
<v Speaker 1>pullout couch.</v>

108
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Oddly new friends or recent graduates</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to crash on my couch.</v>

109
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>So I put the couch on its end so brian</v>
<v Speaker 1>could climb it and look out the window.</v>

110
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 1>I had only the one window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I myself could not look out the window.</v>

111
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was quite high.</v>

112
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.020
<v Speaker 1>So I had no heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No girlfriend.</v>

113
00:08:31.021 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>What are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No acting agent.</v>

114
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.400
<v Speaker 1>But I had a cat named Brian who told me</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world outside.</v>

115
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I stayed for 10 years.</v>

116
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.983
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

117
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pity me.</v>

118
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>There's a</v>

119
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.813
<v Speaker 1>happy ending.</v>

120
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:06.010
<v Speaker 1>When I was 29 I told myself the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting job I get,</v>

121
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.040
<v Speaker 1>no matter what it pays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will from now on for better or worse</v>

122
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.660
<v Speaker 1>be a working actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I quit my position at the</v>

123
00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:22.520
<v Speaker 1>professional examination services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friends really weren't happy about</v>

124
00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:25.940
<v Speaker 1>that because he was so easy to find me</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I work there work was,</v>

125
00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:27.710
<v Speaker 1>there was the only place I had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet.</v>

126
00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:31.880
<v Speaker 1>This was at the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet and now I didn't have either</v>

127
00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:36.881
<v Speaker 1>the internet or a cell phone or a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something good happened.</v>

128
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I got a low ping theater job in a play</v>
<v Speaker 1>called imperfect love,</v>

129
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.930
<v Speaker 1>which led to a film called 13 moons with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same writer,</v>

130
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.570
<v Speaker 1>which led to other roles which led to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other roles and I've worked as an actor</v>

131
00:09:53.571 --> 00:09:54.404
<v Speaker 1>ever since.</v>

132
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

133
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know that would happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 29 walking away from data processing,</v>

134
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years in a place without heat,</v>

135
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.090
<v Speaker 1>six years at a job I felt stuck in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I was afraid of change.</v>

136
00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents didn't have much money,</v>

137
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.840
<v Speaker 1>but they struggled to send me to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best schools.</v>

138
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And one of the most important things</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did for me and graduates,</v>

139
00:10:40.451 --> 00:10:45.451
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't want to hear this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that once I graduated I was on my</v>

140
00:10:46.361 --> 00:10:49.250
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Financially it was my turn.</v>

141
00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Herons are applauding graduates or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This made me very hungry.</v>

142
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be lazy.</v>

143
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm totally lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but back then I couldn't be.</v>

144
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:23.300
<v Speaker 1>And so at 29 and a very long last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the company of the actors and</v>

145
00:11:23.301 --> 00:11:26.150
<v Speaker 1>writers and directors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had sought out that first year,</v>

146
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.810
<v Speaker 1>that first day after school</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

147
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I am by their sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise the rest of your life to meet you.</v>

148
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Don't search for defining moments</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they will never come.</v>

149
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Well the birth of your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

150
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just six months.</v>

151
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:58.570
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life is forever changed and that's</v>

152
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:02.620
<v Speaker 1>much defining moment ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm talking about in the rest of</v>

153
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most importantly in your work,</v>

154
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.130
<v Speaker 1>the moments that define you have already</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and they will already happen</v>

155
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:12.964
<v Speaker 1>again</v>

156
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.700
<v Speaker 1>and it passes so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So please bring each other along with</v>

157
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:26.680
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone you need is in this room.</v>

158
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 1>These are the shiny more important</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

159
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:41.770
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

160
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sucks after graduation.</v>

161
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 1>It really does.</v>

162
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

163
00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

164
00:12:58.731 --> 00:13:00.950
<v Speaker 1>At least it did for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the only thing I know</v>

165
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.230
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just get a bit derailed,</v>

166
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.090
<v Speaker 1>but soon something starts to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>

167
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Rhythm sets in</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like it did after your first few</v>

168
00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:18.464
<v Speaker 1>days here.</v>

169
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

170
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Just try not to wait until like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your 29 before you find it</v>

171
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.130
<v Speaker 1>and if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine too.</v>

172
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Some of us never find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you will.</v>

173
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 1>I promise you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are already here.</v>

174
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 1>That's such an enormous step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All its own.</v>

175
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.750
<v Speaker 1>You'll find your rhythm or continue the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one you,</v>

176
00:13:49.751 --> 00:13:54.751
<v Speaker 1>I've already found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was walking downtown in Manhattan the</v>

177
00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.850
<v Speaker 1>other day and I was approached by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of very sweet young ladies,</v>

178
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:07.520
<v Speaker 1>easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually there.</v>

179
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Erm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of running fever actually down the</v>

180
00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:14.811
<v Speaker 1>street after me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they got to meet breathless.</v>

181
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what to say or couldn't</v>

182
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:27.280
<v Speaker 1>form the words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it came out that they were Nyu</v>

183
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 1>freshmen and they were majoring in</v>
<v Speaker 1>musical theater.</v>

184
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on in.</v>

185
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 1>We're like science majors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were running after me.</v>

186
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.260
<v Speaker 1>What musicals are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I inquired.</v>

187
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them said,</v>

188
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:52.170
<v Speaker 1>looking down at her shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we aren't allowed to be in plays our</v>

189
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:53.990
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our freshman year</v>

190
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were paying very high tuition.</v>

191
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tuning,</v>

192
00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:07.331
<v Speaker 1>not do what they love doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I said,</v>

193
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang in there.</v>

194
00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

195
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.900
<v Speaker 1>What I should have said was</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't wait until they tell you you are</v>

196
00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:26.940
<v Speaker 1>ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get in there.</v>

197
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.190

198
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.380
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

199
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.640
<v Speaker 1>when I went to school here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a freshman wanted to write direct and</v>

200
00:15:48.641 --> 00:15:53.641
<v Speaker 1>star in her own musical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lights would already be hung for</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

206
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.060

<v Speaker 1>before I gave myself permission to fail.</v>

207
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:19.803
<v Speaker 2>Please</v>

208
