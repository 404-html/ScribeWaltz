1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Some decisions or major decisions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also there are a lot of small decisions</v>

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>that we don't make that they tax our</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>

3
00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>They drain our energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They create a lot of anxiety and</v>

4
00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:19.411
<v Speaker 1>nervousness and mental torment because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't take care of it.</v>

5
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.390
<v Speaker 1>We decide not to decide which is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Deciding to decide to act</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a major,</v>

7
00:00:31.421 --> 00:00:35.740
<v Speaker 1>major challenge for all of us at</v>
<v Speaker 1>different points in different areas of</v>

8
00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:40.741
<v Speaker 1>our lives and there are things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to us along the way.</v>

9
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Experiences that we have that prevent us</v>
<v Speaker 1>from working through the mental block of</v>

10
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing those things that we know we</v>

11
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>ought to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I want you to think about is</v>

12
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.510
<v Speaker 1>what is there that you know you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that you want to do this,</v>

13
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been holding back for some reason</v>

14
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>

15
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.430
<v Speaker 1>You just have not been able to gather</v>
<v Speaker 1>your nerves or be able to work through</v>

16
00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>all the procrastinating or putting it</v>
<v Speaker 1>off or justifying or blaming some reason</v>

17
00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just haven't done it</v>

18
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.260
<v Speaker 1>and you know you ought to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really want to do this,</v>

19
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know why you haven't done</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

20
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Anybody know what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hand.</v>

21
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Believes okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I've got company here this evening.</v>

22
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking to myself now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

23
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>all we know that this is not easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in order to begin to reinvent</v>

24
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.930
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to make a conscious,</v>

25
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 1>deliberate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>determined effort.</v>

26
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.373
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

27
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>That you really have got to put all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself into it.</v>

28
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>It's very challenging to add to do those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that at times when you're looking</v>

29
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:55.124
<v Speaker 1>at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

30
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I know I need to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't feel like it.</v>

31
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I need to do it yet.</v>

32
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

33
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do?</v>

34
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:11.360
<v Speaker 1>What are those things that cause us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do like that?</v>

35
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that among the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent us from acting,</v>

36
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>it's the fear of failure and if you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>already failed,</v>

37
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to fail again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pain of that,</v>

38
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>the disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear of loss is another thing</v>

39
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.210
<v Speaker 1>because many times when we do those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we know we need to do,</v>

40
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.200
<v Speaker 1>we feel that we might lose somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love very much and care about.</v>

41
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.950
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to hurt anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of us don't act because we want</v>

42
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:46.970
<v Speaker 1>other people's approval.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want everybody to like us and to</v>

43
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:49.760
<v Speaker 1>accept us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not possible.</v>

44
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Many of us don't do the things that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do and don't act because of lack</v>

45
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>of self confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't believe enough in ourselves.</v>

46
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I have friend who's been working on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>job where she's miserable,</v>

47
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>talented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go to another place that she can</v>

48
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>do what she wants to do and make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of money that she would like to</v>

49
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:16.561
<v Speaker 1>make and have had some offers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because of her fear and how the lack</v>

50
00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:18.650
<v Speaker 1>of self confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.730
<v Speaker 1>things might not work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she won't take a chance on yourself.</v>

52
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.870
<v Speaker 1>So there she is spending eight hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

53
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.300
<v Speaker 1>five days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's miserable.</v>

54
00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>She hates to go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not paying on what she's</v>

55
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>watching knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet instill,</v>

56
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>she won't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she knows she much to do and it's</v>

57
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:45.211
<v Speaker 1>wearing out that a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>their jobs are making them sick because</v>

58
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>they want to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You check out the absenteeism and the</v>

59
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>people that are depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

60
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming to work angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you doing?</v>

61
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.703
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

62
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>just leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even 9:00 yet.</v>

63
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:04.951
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about good morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That days you got to work.</v>

64
00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:09.180
<v Speaker 1>You want to just keep driving past a</v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

65
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:14.181
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't want to stop because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not in sync with who you are,</v>

66
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.760
<v Speaker 1>but you haven't acted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have another friend.</v>

67
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.240
<v Speaker 1>He's got brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a business consultant.</v>

68
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.020
<v Speaker 1>He helped a lot of people get their</v>
<v Speaker 1>business started and people come to him</v>

69
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>because they know he's knowledgeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy wants to start his own</v>

70
00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:32.100
<v Speaker 1>business now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart.</v>

71
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.410
<v Speaker 1>He can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody believes in it except him and</v>

72
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:39.780
<v Speaker 1>he's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talked himself out of the well,</v>

73
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:41.190
<v Speaker 1>the numbers aren't right,</v>

74
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.590
<v Speaker 1>so there are many reasons why we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

75
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.270
<v Speaker 1>There are other things though that</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect us is that not wanting to take</v>

76
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:55.320
<v Speaker 1>personal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want somebody else to do it,</v>

77
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.940
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times we pick up our inability to</v>

78
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:02.790
<v Speaker 1>do certain things from people that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

79
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.540
<v Speaker 1>people that we admire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we identify with them and we live in the</v>

80
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:14.451
<v Speaker 1>context of their ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their opinions and their life patterns.</v>

81
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.770
<v Speaker 1>We buy into it unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother is a pack rat.</v>

82
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.340
<v Speaker 1>She keeps everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't throw anything away and I</v>

83
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:30.570
<v Speaker 1>have unconsciously picked that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now my mother never said,</v>

84
00:05:30.571 --> 00:05:33.810
<v Speaker 1>let me show you how to keep everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than just clutter things.</v>

85
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I unconsciously picked that up many</v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

86
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We tried to honor the people we love by</v>

87
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:44.610
<v Speaker 1>being like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the same token,</v>

88
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I realized something about myself when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had some major decisions to make and I</v>

89
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>find myself acting like my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother mother's the kind of person</v>

90
00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>that when she has a problem with one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other foster that she adopted,</v>

91
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.000
<v Speaker 1>she won't confront them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She will call me last.</v>

92
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you tell lender to move?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's lazy.</v>

93
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>She won't go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She runs the street all day and then she</v>

94
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>comes home and wants to sleep all day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think she's doing droughts.</v>

95
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Mama,</v>

96
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>why don't you tell Linda that I bought</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house for you.</v>

97
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I told you when she wanted to come home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't let a grown person come there and</v>

98
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You let her in will after all she is my</v>

99
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Mama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you handle that.</v>

100
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>When I tell her to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she say,</v>

101
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>mama say I can say Mama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I say and you tell her yes,</v>

102
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 1>and then you call me and say she's still</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

103
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Why worry me with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Mama hasn't developed the courage to</v>

104
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 1>act on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people won't act until there's a</v>

105
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>crisis situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Linda stopped stealing from Mama</v>

106
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 1>and took us social security check to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>some drugs,</v>

107
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>mama got some cars to say get outta here</v>

108
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.820
<v Speaker 1>would ever come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she wouldn't do it until then and</v>

109
00:07:12.821 --> 00:07:14.680
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to wait until a crisis</v>

110
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:17.830
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend that had been having a</v>

111
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:20.710
<v Speaker 1>challenge with losing weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of us had been dealing with that</v>

112
00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:25.711
<v Speaker 1>challenge and for the past 40 years is</v>
<v Speaker 1>always seemed like weighed over 235</v>

113
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:29.110
<v Speaker 1>pounds and so he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

114
00:07:29.111 --> 00:07:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I just can't lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm big boned it.</v>

115
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen any fat skeleton.</v>

116
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to act on your health.</v>

117
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 1>You can change this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to go to your grave fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all digging early grades without</v>

119
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to do this.</v>

120
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 1>They need to have a support group around</v>
<v Speaker 1>m and m peanuts.</v>

121
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.250
<v Speaker 1>You want a support group on something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and throw snickers in there too.</v>

122
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you about the help we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

123
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.410
<v Speaker 1>So what happened with bud though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he became ill a few weeks ago,</v>

124
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.040
<v Speaker 1>so he bought in the last few weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has lost more weight than is ever lost.</v>

125
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Even when we were competing with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

126
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:20.490
<v Speaker 1>betting a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was bob became</v>

127
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:23.700
<v Speaker 1>diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went into an insulin shock.</v>

128
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:28.500
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know that he was diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his blood sugar became high and the</v>

129
00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:30.840
<v Speaker 1>doctor said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are diabetic.</v>

130
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.710
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to have insulin</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots every day.</v>

131
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.400
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have to change your diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let me tell you what's going to</v>

132
00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:41.580
<v Speaker 1>happen if you don't do what we tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

133
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a possibility that you can</v>

134
00:08:44.221 --> 00:08:47.400
<v Speaker 1>become an amputee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>

135
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.770
<v Speaker 1>you can go blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>

136
00:08:49.771 --> 00:08:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you can become impotent bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They help me</v>

137
00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.890
<v Speaker 4>when?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>

138
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when bro got to jail and guys say,</v>

139
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 4>can I do to be saved?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want one my peanut butter and jelly</v>

140
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 4>sandwiches?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

141
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can't believe you're eating</v>

142
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:18.180
<v Speaker 4>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're exercising,</v>

143
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.560
<v Speaker 4>jogging in place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

144
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.310
<v Speaker 4>he had the ability to do,</v>

145
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 1>do it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some people.</v>

146
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.330
<v Speaker 1>It takes that kind of crises to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>them into reality in order for them to</v>

147
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 1>act in their own best interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people have to hit rock bottom in</v>

148
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 1>order to ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why you want to begin to</v>

149
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 1>look out on your life and what you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

150
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:51.410
<v Speaker 1>and I think that when we began to focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the area of what does it take for us</v>

151
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:57.170
<v Speaker 1>to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we can say events can inspire us</v>

152
00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:02.601
<v Speaker 1>to act at that particular event in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>life circumstances.</v>

153
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to do something and he just</v>

154
00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:11.820
<v Speaker 1>did not have the motivation and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive and the confidence within himself,</v>

155
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.970
<v Speaker 1>but as circumstances change overnight</v>
<v Speaker 1>through an acquisition of a company that</v>

156
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:20.490
<v Speaker 1>he worked for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost his job.</v>

157
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Through the inspiration of desperation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to act</v>

158
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.700
<v Speaker 1>the life also of things that can inspire</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

159
00:10:30.701 --> 00:10:32.860
<v Speaker 1>that see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the courage,</v>

160
00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:34.240
<v Speaker 1>and that's what it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Courage.</v>

161
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.990
<v Speaker 1>It takes guts to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you know you need to do.</v>

162
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.670
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have the courage to act</v>
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>

163
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.690
<v Speaker 1>many times we'll move on you and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you at live will whoop your butt so bad.</v>

164
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.900
<v Speaker 1>You will be so miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will get so much how you say,</v>

165
00:10:55.901 --> 00:10:58.900
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will do it.</v>

166
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.180
<v Speaker 1>What do you want me to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take me</v>

167
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.940
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop smoking.</v>

168
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Said Sam Axelrod,</v>

169
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 1>you have emphysema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam never picked up another cigarette</v>

170
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.820
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look of stupid people smoking.</v>

171
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did it for 35 years.</v>

172
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>How can you talk about people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I was different,</v>

173
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to help them.</v>

174
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.380
<v Speaker 4>They don't</v>

175
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.900
<v Speaker 1>do the same thing I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be compassionate now.</v>

176
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Isn't an interesting how quickly we</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget,</v>

177
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.430
<v Speaker 1>so I'm saying that look at something in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

178
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.450
<v Speaker 1>It might be just writing a letter to</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody to say thank you.</v>

179
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>It might be just to apologize to</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

180
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I had a confrontation and the penobscot</v>
<v Speaker 1>building with the security guard there.</v>

181
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.910
<v Speaker 1>He responded to me what I perceived as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative way and he and I engaged in an</v>

182
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:53.710
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not like the way I handled that.</v>

183
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I avoided going through the front door</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time because I didn't want to</v>

184
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 1>face it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally I decided to act and I went up</v>

185
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 1>to him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to apologize to you for the way</v>

186
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>in which I handled this argument we had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other day.</v>

187
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you accept my apology.</v>

188
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:12.423
<v Speaker 1>He said I do.</v>

189
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much.</v>

190
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I felt relieved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you decide to act,</v>

191
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not always going to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A friend of mine did some work for me.</v>

192
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:27.090
<v Speaker 1>It was below par to say the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that this guy was capable of</v>

193
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:32.581
<v Speaker 1>doing better work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that he also had a fragile ego,</v>

194
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 1>so I was trying to think of what is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most sensitive way in which I can share</v>

195
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:41.130
<v Speaker 1>this information with him because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted him to do my work over.</v>

196
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I was going to pay him for what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I needed my work done right.</v>

197
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.390
<v Speaker 1>But I was afraid that I would hurt his</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

198
00:12:48.391 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 1>So I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very meticulous and how I approached him</v>

199
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me share this with you.</v>

200
00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care about you and that you are very</v>

201
00:12:55.931 --> 00:13:00.931
<v Speaker 1>talented and gifted person and you and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>both know that what you have given me is</v>

202
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:04.900
<v Speaker 1>not a true reflection of your talents</v>
<v Speaker 1>and abilities.</v>

203
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back in the studio and do this</v>

204
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said to me,</v>

205
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to forget you ever said that.</v>

206
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.790
<v Speaker 1>I was wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never spoke to me again.</v>

207
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Now when you decide to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have some people like</v>

208
00:13:30.141 --> 00:13:32.990
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're no longer friends.</v>

209
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I lost sleep over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

210
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that.</v>

211
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember setting up one night looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the phone.</v>

212
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.350
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got call him.</v>

213
00:13:42.351 --> 00:13:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

214
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.610
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

215
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.100
<v Speaker 1>forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see men looking.</v>

216
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.700
<v Speaker 1>We've been knowing each other too long</v>
<v Speaker 1>to allow this to come between us.</v>

217
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.440
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't call me anymore.</v>

218
00:13:51.441 --> 00:13:55.340
<v Speaker 1>And Hung Up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I wanted to think about how,</v>

219
00:13:55.341 --> 00:13:58.490
<v Speaker 1>what can I do to make it up to him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then something came to me less.</v>

220
00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.430
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to prove?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many things.</v>

221
00:14:01.431 --> 00:14:06.170
<v Speaker 1>We don't do it because in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want people to like us.</v>

222
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.540
<v Speaker 1>That's unnecessary losses in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you decide acting in your best</v>

223
00:14:11.541 --> 00:14:13.430
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lose some friends.</v>

224
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's not going to approve of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some people that work like</v>

225
00:14:17.361 --> 00:14:18.320
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think you are?</v>

226
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.690
<v Speaker 1>You are arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think you can do?</v>

227
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.620
<v Speaker 1>You think you'd get away with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're selfish.</v>

228
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Thanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that.</v>

229
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.460
<v Speaker 1>It's my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what I'm saying to you is that as</v>

230
00:14:34.461 --> 00:14:37.190
<v Speaker 1>you begin to look out on your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is challenging.</v>

231
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.060
<v Speaker 1>This is not easy acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that we can begin</v>

232
00:14:41.061 --> 00:14:43.820
<v Speaker 1>to do to harness our will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

233
00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got to bring it out and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

234
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:52.580
<v Speaker 1>You got to take the power out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to it to the truth,</v>

235
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is that it has no power</v>
<v Speaker 1>over you,</v>

236
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.030
<v Speaker 1>so write down something you want to act</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

237
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.240
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason that you've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding back and look at it.</v>

238
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.650
<v Speaker 1>The next thing is ask yourself the</v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

239
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.230
<v Speaker 1>is it helping you to continue to put it</v>
<v Speaker 1>off?</v>

240
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.070
<v Speaker 1>If it's an asset for you to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinate,</v>

241
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.760
<v Speaker 1>then continue to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a liability for you,</v>

242
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 1>if it's causing you some mental and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional challenges or perhaps a</v>

243
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:22.940
<v Speaker 1>financial problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

244
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Examine that for what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next step.</v>

245
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Ask Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's blocking you?</v>

246
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.490
<v Speaker 1>What's preventing you from acting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you have the courage to handle</v>

247
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why won't you face that?</v>

248
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.710
<v Speaker 1>What are you running away from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of avoidance behavior are you</v>

249
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 1>engaged in?</v>

250
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Next is what is the worst thing that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen when you take action?</v>

251
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.600
<v Speaker 1>So I looked at that and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the worst thing can happen when I</v>

252
00:15:54.601 --> 00:15:56.070
<v Speaker 1>tell him this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can say,</v>

253
00:15:56.071 --> 00:16:01.071
<v Speaker 1>I don't like you any did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what happened?</v>

254
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.510
<v Speaker 1>I experienced that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at that,</v>

255
00:16:03.511 --> 00:16:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>

256
00:16:04.951 --> 00:16:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't dye</v>

257
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.890
<v Speaker 1>my feelings were hurt a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost some sleep about it and sometimes</v>

258
00:16:13.891 --> 00:16:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I think about it when I drive past his</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

259
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.250
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uncomfortable,</v>

260
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bother me anymore.</v>

261
00:16:23.791 --> 00:16:27.960
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten used to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is the worst thing that can</v>

262
00:16:27.961 --> 00:16:30.810
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to visualize that experience,</v>

263
00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:33.630
<v Speaker 1>that feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nervousness and the discomfort and</v>

264
00:16:33.631 --> 00:16:36.900
<v Speaker 1>the more you run into in your mind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>less power that it will have.</v>

265
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Next is how will you feel after taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>this action?</v>

266
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I felt a sense of personal achievement</v>

267
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.060
<v Speaker 1>when I faced somebody that has been my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentor for years and for years that was</v>

268
00:16:55.021 --> 00:16:59.520
<v Speaker 1>something I wanted to tell him and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the courage to tell him</v>

269
00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:04.320
<v Speaker 1>because it was always I was a student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to teach her.</v>

270
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.980
<v Speaker 1>It was always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked up to him and admired him and</v>

271
00:17:07.981 --> 00:17:12.981
<v Speaker 1>held him in high esteem and I was always</v>
<v Speaker 1>grateful and thankful for the impact</v>

272
00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:16.740
<v Speaker 1>that he had on my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I loved him so much.</v>

273
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the courage to say to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please stop drinking so much you an</v>

274
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.260
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need help.</v>

275
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the courage because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid that he might not like me.</v>

276
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I was afraid that he might be hurt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>crushed,</v>

277
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.460
<v Speaker 1>that we would no longer be friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to jeopardize what we had.</v>

278
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I loved him a great deal and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how this would affect our</v>

279
00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:48.521
<v Speaker 1>relationship and I didn't even want him</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know that I knew that he was an</v>

280
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:53.561
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic and so I was a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spineless and the name of law.</v>

281
00:17:55.110 --> 00:18:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I did it to justify to myself to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>from helping somebody that I loved from</v>

282
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:03.150
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

283
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I love him so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't tell him this.</v>

284
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how he would handle</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

285
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.950
<v Speaker 1>To know that I know that he's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>

286
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:16.580
<v Speaker 1>and finally after years I developed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>courage to face my teacher,</v>

287
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:24.230
<v Speaker 1>my mentor who has molded me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who looks at me now and wanted to do</v>

288
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:27.450
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing now and did not do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

289
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:32.451
<v Speaker 1>Came at a different time and it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>time for what he brought and he's living</v>

290
00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:37.410
<v Speaker 1>through me and I had to face this man</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's been like a father to me.</v>

291
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you something.</v>

292
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.920
<v Speaker 1>You've got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you very much.</v>

293
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Please stop drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're killing yourself.</v>

294
00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:51.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not just social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do it every day.</v>

295
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.800
<v Speaker 1>You need help and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do to support you in that.</v>

296
00:18:55.801 --> 00:19:00.801
<v Speaker 1>I will please stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he looked at me and I had no idea</v>

297
00:19:03.841 --> 00:19:06.810
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he was going to handle that at first</v>

298
00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dare you,</v>

299
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:16.310
<v Speaker 1>and we just looked at each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I reached out to embrace him</v>

300
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.000
<v Speaker 1>and we never ever embrace man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macho never hugged me.</v>

301
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I hugged him and he just stood there</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his arms straight.</v>

302
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.960
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't raise his arms to hug me</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and he was shocked and after he got</v>

303
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:35.190
<v Speaker 1>over the initial shock when you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring him stuff to speak,</v>

304
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 1>to maintain his composure because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could never afford to let me,</v>

305
00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 1>his students see him vulnerable or admit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was right.</v>

306
00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.930
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be seeing you.</v>

307
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:48.623
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes sir.</v>

308
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you why.</v>

309
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Be by the house to see the car before I</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave.</v>

310
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.780
<v Speaker 1>And when he walked away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at first I was very depressed about it</v>

311
00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:00.661
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

312
00:20:00.661 --> 00:20:03.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe it wasn't my place to do this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

313
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:04.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you act,</v>

314
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:05.940
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have some second</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

315
00:20:05.941 --> 00:20:07.080
<v Speaker 1>And then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

316
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.973
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

317
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.200
<v Speaker 1>I did what I felt I did it because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel very strongly about this</v>

318
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.910
<v Speaker 1>and fortunately he called me back a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks later and left word with the</v>

319
00:20:22.381 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 1>answering service les,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Les Brown.</v>

320
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.560
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say thank you</v>

321
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.083
<v Speaker 3>and hung up.</v>

322
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I was a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we look out on our lives,</v>

323
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.030
<v Speaker 1>you asked the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

324
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Look at as you think about this that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know need to handle,</v>

325
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:53.050
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then write down three strong reasons</v>

326
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.620
<v Speaker 1>on why you know you must take action</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being explicit and descriptive in</v>

327
00:21:00.061 --> 00:21:03.150
<v Speaker 1>your reasons because your reasons have</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

328
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Your reasons will drive you when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have doubt,</v>

329
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:12.090
<v Speaker 1>when your faith becomes weak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your reasons will fortify your faith.</v>

330
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.420
<v Speaker 1>When you have an inner conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say no,</v>

331
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.960
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your reasons will become your rod and</v>

332
00:21:18.961 --> 00:21:22.140
<v Speaker 1>your staff to convert you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take you through those challenging</v>

333
00:21:22.141 --> 00:21:22.974
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>

334
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.090
<v Speaker 1>so write down your reasons and what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will find,</v>

335
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.370
<v Speaker 1>but when you decide to act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you decided to take life on,</v>

336
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 1>and let me warn you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be painful.</v>

337
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 1>It will be uncomfortable and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the growth is.</v>

338
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.860
<v Speaker 1>When you're uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're stretching up,</v>

339
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.230
<v Speaker 1>when you're taking a life bother collar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get thrown to the ground</v>

340
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:54.970
<v Speaker 1>again and again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you had the termination and you</v>

341
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:58.360
<v Speaker 1>know that what you're doing is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you your life.</v>

342
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.730
<v Speaker 1>It gives us special meeting and power to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

343
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.810
<v Speaker 1>You will have some power from on high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will discover some things about</v>

344
00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:07.330
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll begin to electrify your</v>

345
00:22:07.331 --> 00:22:10.240
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll begin to discover some things</v>

346
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 1>about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know you've got.</v>

347
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.350
<v Speaker 1>When you put yourself in that type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging situation,</v>

348
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.980
<v Speaker 4>repeat after me please.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can go into action</v>

349
00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.600
<v Speaker 5>on anything in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing is stopping me but me.</v>

350
00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:33.650
<v Speaker 5>No challenge in my life</v>
<v Speaker 5>has any power over me.</v>

351
00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.280
<v Speaker 4>Here's something that Howard Thurman</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote on the decision to act.</v>

352
00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:46.150
<v Speaker 4>He said it's a wondrous thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that a decision to act releases energy</v>

353
00:22:47.421 --> 00:22:52.190
<v Speaker 4>and the personality for days on end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a person may drift along without much</v>

354
00:22:52.191 --> 00:22:55.400
<v Speaker 4>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having no particular sense of direction</v>

355
00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:00.820
<v Speaker 4>and having no will to change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then something happens to alter the</v>

356
00:23:01.671 --> 00:23:04.970
<v Speaker 4>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It may be something very simple and</v>

357
00:23:04.971 --> 00:23:08.420
<v Speaker 4>inconsequential in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it stabs awake.</v>

358
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:13.190
<v Speaker 4>It alarms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it disturbs in a flash.</v>

359
00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:17.330
<v Speaker 4>One gets a vivid picture of one self and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it passes.</v>

360
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:21.650
<v Speaker 4>The result is decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sharp,</v>

361
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:26.270
<v Speaker 4>definitive decision and the wake of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>decision,</v>

362
00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.690
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even as a part of the decision itself,</v>

363
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 4>energy is released.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The act of decision sweeps all before it</v>

364
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.580
<v Speaker 4>and the life of the individual maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>

365
00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:48.180
<v Speaker 4>When did you decide to make decisions to</v>
<v Speaker 4>act?</v>

366
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:54.670
<v Speaker 4>You began to access power within you</v>
<v Speaker 4>that will increase your self esteem,</v>

367
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.360
<v Speaker 4>that will increase and enhance your</v>
<v Speaker 4>personal power,</v>

368
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:05.280
<v Speaker 4>but that puts you in charge of life and</v>
<v Speaker 4>life has a whole new meaning for you as</v>

369
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.440
<v Speaker 4>a sense of personal freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't mean you're not gonna.</v>

370
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 4>Have any struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean that you're not gonna have</v>

371
00:24:14.691 --> 00:24:17.390
<v Speaker 4>any challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't mean that you're not going to</v>

372
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 4>suffer any defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

373
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.241
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

374
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:24.220
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what it does mean that you're</v>

375
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.470
<v Speaker 4>putting yourself in the position to</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow.</v>

376
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:31.310
<v Speaker 4>You're putting yourself in line with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your higher calling and your highest</v>

377
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:32.144
<v Speaker 4>self,</v>

378
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.793
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

379
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.450
<v Speaker 4>that's what life is about.</v>

380
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.900
<v Speaker 3>Thank</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

381
00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.650
<v Speaker 3>This affirmation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please everybody stand please.</v>

382
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm standing up to live</v>

383
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.280
<v Speaker 5>and the challenges in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to use all of me,</v>

384
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.200
<v Speaker 5>all of my courage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my faith,</v>

385
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.570
<v Speaker 5>determination,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and any help and support that I can give</v>

386
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.600
<v Speaker 5>anyone</v>
<v Speaker 5>to realize that greatness</v>

387
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.490
<v Speaker 5>together we can shake somebody's hand on</v>
<v Speaker 5>your right and left and say,</v>

388
00:25:30.491 --> 00:25:31.630
<v Speaker 5>you got what it takes.</v>
