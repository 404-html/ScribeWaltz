1
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>We all have this negative self talk that</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes in our head.</v>

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's enough people that are telling</v>

3
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>us we can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're not good enough.</v>

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Why do we want to tell ourselves that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know for a fact that thoughts influence</v>

5
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:21.620
<v Speaker 1>actions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sat there with the,</v>

6
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the video sheldon,</v>

7
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Dr Levy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so right.</v>

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.340
<v Speaker 1>We know that our thoughts influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Why do we want to see that negative self</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to ourselves?</v>

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>We need to get our own self affirmation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Ali.</v>

11
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>What was his self affirmation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the greatest.</v>

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Who else is going to tell you they need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be quiet moments in your bedroom,</v>

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 1>quiet moments when you're brushing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth,</v>

14
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 1>that we need to reaffirm I am the</v>
<v Speaker 1>captain of my ship and the master of my</v>

15
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.240
<v Speaker 1>fate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is my affirmation and looking</v>

16
00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>forward to a time that I would feel good</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

17
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.530
<v Speaker 1>helped me to keep moving forward.</v>

18
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I had to be brave and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't always easy.</v>

19
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I faltered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had bad days,</v>

20
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>but I realized that being brave isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be easy.</v>

21
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel it's the key way to keep moving</v>

22
00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all at all,</v>

23
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't waste energy feeling bad for</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

24
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>I surround myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that I want to be with,</v>

25
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>and I keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with this philosophy,</v>

26
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I hope that all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of your obstacles,</v>

27
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>you can have a very happy life as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I am the captain of my ship,</v>

28
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If no one else will</v>

29
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>get away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's enough of that Muhammad Ali,</v>

30
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I am the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no one better than me.</v>

31
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a difference between Hubris and ego</v>
<v Speaker 1>and false pride.</v>

32
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>It's just reminding yourself and quiet</v>
<v Speaker 1>silent moments.</v>

33
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I put it down on the list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right beside my mirror</v>

34
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 2>in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>

35
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Ever mainland Japan ever met in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>pyramid in America,</v>

36
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.370
<v Speaker 2>the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Deal.</v>

37
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.200
<v Speaker 2>So I kept working to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be champion of the world,</v>

38
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 2>but better than all of those before me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to argue with you.</v>

39
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be just like that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of your already there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>way somehow with the help of God,</v>
