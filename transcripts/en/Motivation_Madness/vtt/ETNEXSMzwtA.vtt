1
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>When you start thinking about Alexa and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these other things,</v>

2
00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that my career has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been completely predicated on is the</v>

3
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:17.650
<v Speaker 1>fact that I am willing to take chances</v>
<v Speaker 1>on things that aren't mainstream yet</v>

4
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>because I understand that if I go after</v>
<v Speaker 1>social code and I,</v>

5
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>if I go after vine and if I go after</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mick Mack and if I go after Yak and all,</v>

6
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.040
<v Speaker 1>if I go after all these things that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>only need one of those seven to actually</v>

7
00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>hit snapchat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram to win that bet.</v>

8
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>We have enormous fear in this room to I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to wait or let's wait to it's big</v>

9
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:43.390
<v Speaker 1>or what if I waste my time right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will I waste my time on these platforms</v>

10
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't become big?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the other themes that I</v>

11
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.820
<v Speaker 1>really wanted to leave here with</v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight,</v>

12
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.800
<v Speaker 1>knowing the demo of this room is we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a lot more risk tolerance on new</v>

13
00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:54.400
<v Speaker 1>platforms.</v>

14
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>If you're not playing back to details</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know you're taking notes.</v>

15
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>If you're not playing with Marco Polo</v>
<v Speaker 1>and afterschool and House party,</v>

16
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 1>then you're not there potentially at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>platforms.</v>

17
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>That can become the next things at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of our tongue.</v>

18
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 1>How many people here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be really honest.</v>

19
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

20
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 1>really honest with ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inbound,</v>

21
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>please raise your hand if this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people in this room,</v>

22
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>and I want everybody look around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said two and a half years ago,</v>

23
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.120
<v Speaker 1>three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even a year ago,</v>

24
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>that they would never be on snapchat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was stupid and now have a snapchat</v>

25
00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raise your hands,</v>

26
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.270
<v Speaker 1>raise it high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher this.</v>

27
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>This is where all the action is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where all the action is.</v>

28
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>This is the opportunity in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we continue to downplay.</v>

29
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>We continue to downplay the upside</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we feared the risk of being on</v>

30
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>there and wasting time.</v>

31
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.660
<v Speaker 1>If you have not achieved what you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to professionally or in life,</v>

32
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>time is the number one thing you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to deploy as much of that as</v>

33
00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>humanly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the asset when you have not</v>

34
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 1>achieved the things that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in life,</v>

35
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.520
<v Speaker 1>and it is because of time that you ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to put into these platforms and</v>

36
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a massive mistake.</v>

37
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 1>It's the one asset you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Everybody in this room has money.</v>

38
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.180
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You agree?</v>

39
00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are you going to work in fucking face</v>

40
00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

41
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.600
<v Speaker 1>It's the one thing we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the one thing we have because</v>

42
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to come up with excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd spend my life reading excuses on</v>

43
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 1>social media and my inbox of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't born that way.</v>

44
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't born here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

45
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm a female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an immigrant,</v>

46
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm a minority.</v>

47
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm a transgender ix excuses reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

48
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I truly believe those are disadvantages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not naive to the shortcomings of</v>

49
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is nobody cares.</v>

50
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>The market doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we sit and we dwell and if so,</v>

51
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>what do you think we've been doing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last month and what we're going to</v>

52
00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>do morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to dwell and complain and</v>

53
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>that's utter defense instead of going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the office.</v>

54
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>And so we spend unbelievable amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time dwelling and wasting our time on</v>

55
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>dumb shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like peop.</v>

56
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>People literally email me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so lucky and I wish this was</v>

57
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>happening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the third tweet or the third</v>

58
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.580
<v Speaker 1>instagram post is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday stayed home and watched and</v>

59
00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>tighter season of fucking game of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrones.</v>

60
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.860
<v Speaker 1>We need to start understanding how big</v>
<v Speaker 1>this opportunity is because it's for</v>

62
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:35.430
<v Speaker 1>everybody in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will sit back in 2030 years and</v>

63
00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:37.740
<v Speaker 1>regret if you didn't execute in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>

64
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.470
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear that this is for 20</v>

65
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:45.471
<v Speaker 1>and 30 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 50 60 70 it's an equal playing field.</v>

66
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.590
<v Speaker 1>If you're willing to be a practitioner</v>
<v Speaker 1>and understand the ecosystem that I've</v>

67
00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:52.080
<v Speaker 1>been speaking about tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a better time.</v>

68
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very obvious,</v>

69
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.870
<v Speaker 1>these kind of characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no respect for 20 year olds in</v>

70
00:03:57.871 --> 00:03:59.940
<v Speaker 1>the business world 20 years ago when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out.</v>

71
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 1>But now because of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of organizations that</v>

72
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:05.700
<v Speaker 1>apple solutely respect 20 and 30 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>olds.</v>

73
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is happening is I'm spending so</v>

74
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 1>much time with 40 to 60 year old</v>
<v Speaker 1>executives who are dwelling and are</v>

75
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:18.081
<v Speaker 1>upset and tell me dumb shit like Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't grow up with this shit.</v>

76
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Neither did I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alice</v>

77
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I was 20 before I even was on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

78
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I think grow up with this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured it out and so I sit there and</v>

79
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:36.481
<v Speaker 1>see completely capable operators that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have made it happen for the last 2030</v>

80
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 1>years being crippled by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how snapchat works.</v>

81
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>It's so confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were just filled with excuses.</v>

82
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just losing their hunger and</v>

83
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then by the way,</v>

84
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>let me get really mad for two seconds</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my fancy rich friends.</v>

85
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>The thing that I'm completely blown away</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that I had no idea was going on in</v>

86
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>capitalism and meritocracy is once you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rich,</v>

87
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 1>you actually try to spend your dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create laws that allow you not to</v>

88
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:11.731
<v Speaker 1>work and still hold onto your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% right?</v>

89
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm blown away by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were benefit,</v>

90
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you were benefited because in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties to 60 for 40 years you grinded</v>

91
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 1>and out executed somebody and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to make lots of money.</v>

92
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 1>But now that you're tired and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>finished and you're older and don't want</v>

93
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>to put in the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want the next young buck to</v>

94
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>come along and eat your lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how capitalism works.</v>

95
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not.</v>

96
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>And so we have all these trends and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the great fortune of living in an</v>

97
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>era where things have been really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a very long time.</v>

98
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>And so I walk around the world and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>told my wife,</v>

99
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:54.371
<v Speaker 1>Lizzie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Lizzie,</v>

100
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care clearly cause I was such a</v>

101
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>shit student with the kids do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

102
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>But please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't be in programs where we give</v>

103
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:07.451
<v Speaker 1>away seventh place trophies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea who wins the election</v>

104
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we need to fucking band seventh</v>

105
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>place trophies and America.</v>

106
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.660
<v Speaker 1>So we have all these macro situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on and not to mention for a lot of</v>

107
00:06:21.661 --> 00:06:25.740
<v Speaker 1>people here are under 30 you haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in the game during an economic</v>

108
00:06:25.741 --> 00:06:29.070
<v Speaker 1>downturn because things have been very</v>
<v Speaker 1>cushy for the last seven years where if</v>

109
00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:31.350
<v Speaker 1>you're 23 years old and you have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

110
00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:34.560
<v Speaker 1>your company's miraculously worth $4</v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

111
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.030
<v Speaker 1>And so we're living in a very intriguing</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I think that the passion and he</v>

112
00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:42.660
<v Speaker 1>anx and the energy that I bring tonight</v>
<v Speaker 1>are predicated on a couple of tried and</v>

113
00:06:42.661 --> 00:06:44.100
<v Speaker 1>true things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

114
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.970
<v Speaker 1>if you're not making longterm decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be vulnerable.</v>

115
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
<v Speaker 1>The market's changing very quickly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who's looking for short term</v>

116
00:06:51.331 --> 00:06:54.630
<v Speaker 1>stuff gets short term stuff and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets hurt in the long term.</v>

117
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Things like Airbnb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

118
00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.270
<v Speaker 1>airbnb shouldn't have been invented by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian and Joe.</v>

119
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Airbnb should have been invented by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merriot.</v>

120
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.350
<v Speaker 1>But merriot is looking short term and</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't creating business models to put</v>

121
00:07:07.351 --> 00:07:11.880
<v Speaker 1>themselves out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber should have not been created by</v>

122
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Garrett and they shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have not been created by</v>

123
00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Garrett and Travis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have been created by the guy</v>

124
00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:23.130
<v Speaker 1>or girl that owned the most medallions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York City or by Grey Hound.</v>

125
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.920
<v Speaker 1>If you sit here tonight and you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

126
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.630
<v Speaker 1>you're in danger because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody young and hungry that has the</v>

127
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a platform that creates a zero</v>

128
00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:37.710
<v Speaker 1>cost to get into the game that's coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>after your shit.</v>

129
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.980
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't do what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is wake up every single morning,</v>

130
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.300
<v Speaker 1>every single morning and try to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself out of business,</v>

131
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.870
<v Speaker 1>somebody else is gonna do it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is much more fun,</v>

132
00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:51.300
<v Speaker 1>my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put yourself out of business than</v>

133
00:07:51.301 --> 00:07:54.150
<v Speaker 1>have somebody else do it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so please,</v>

134
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.600
<v Speaker 1>if your cushy who's cushy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise your hand if shit's going real</v>

135
00:07:57.601 --> 00:07:58.434
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

136
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three people raise their hand.</v>

137
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I think you need to shut down this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

138
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.253
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

139
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

140
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.841
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing good.</v>

141
00:08:12.841 --> 00:08:13.291
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

142
00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:15.160
<v Speaker 1>we're doing okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

143
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.040
<v Speaker 1>he always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got to understand.</v>

144
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.640
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only thing I have,</v>

145
00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:28.641
<v Speaker 1>I always say that basically my career is</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated much more similar to Mariano</v>

146
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Rivera than anything else that I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of.</v>

147
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.690
<v Speaker 1>If you're a baseball fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a very good closer for the New</v>

148
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 1>York Yankees where basically his entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>career was predicated on one pitch.</v>

149
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.110
<v Speaker 1>He had one pitch for 17 years and nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>could hit it,</v>

150
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's basically my business career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got one pitch,</v>

151
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.770
<v Speaker 1>which is the following.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're going to do before</v>

152
00:08:49.771 --> 00:08:52.650
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that I was gifted with.</v>

153
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Just like if you can sing just like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

154
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>I've always had the intuition I was made</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun of and aggressively made fun of for</v>

155
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 1>launching a website in 1996 because just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people sit here and think that vine</v>

156
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>or snapchat is a fad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people in this room that</v>

157
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>remember where the whole Internet was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fad,</v>

158
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 1>but I bet on it and I built a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and then I was made fun of</v>

159
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 1>because this thing called Youtube came</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and I took a chance on that cause I</v>

160
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 1>thought it was going to be big and</v>
<v Speaker 1>started a wine show in Santa in front of</v>

161
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:23.970
<v Speaker 1>a camera and drank four bottles of wine</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 20 minutes and hundreds of thousands</v>

162
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:28.971
<v Speaker 1>of people watched it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that worked and then twitter</v>

163
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 1>worked and then I invested in twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and facebook and things of that nature.</v>

164
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.850
<v Speaker 1>But I had so many losses along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that's never talked about with</v>

165
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>my genius career was that I was on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube super early,</v>

166
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 1>but I left six months in and started</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing wine library TV exclusively on</v>

167
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 1>viddler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong.</v>

168
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.080
<v Speaker 1>One thing that's not talked about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I thought that the biggest startup</v>

169
00:09:57.081 --> 00:10:01.220
<v Speaker 1>in the world in 2010 was going to be Yo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bango.</v>

170
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I continue to be interested in being</v>

171
00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:14.170
<v Speaker 1>wrong for the rest of my life because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am a pure bred entrepreneur because I'm</v>

172
00:10:14.171 --> 00:10:19.171
<v Speaker 1>not scared of trying things and wasting</v>
<v Speaker 1>my valuable time because I want things</v>

173
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.180
<v Speaker 1>and most of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the most of all the whole</v>

174
00:10:22.181 --> 00:10:24.970
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just genuinely don't give a fuck about</v>

175
00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:29.971
<v Speaker 1>what you think about me</v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced with,</v>

176
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I really care about what everybody says</v>
<v Speaker 1>about me</v>

177
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 1>and in that friction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that you have to deploy real ego</v>

178
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:45.150
<v Speaker 1>and real humility around this course</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we live in that world.</v>

179
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 1>But if I could inspire anything in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that I was here today,</v>

180
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.030
<v Speaker 1>it's very simply this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please do me one favor.</v>

181
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wrap it up with this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this matters so much to me.</v>

182
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it takes,</v>

183
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:59.610
<v Speaker 1>call your grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to your great grandfather's burial</v>

184
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:01.980
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back to the old country,</v>

185
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.280
<v Speaker 1>go to a shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something,</v>

186
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:10.670
<v Speaker 1>do something that recalibrates your</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective on what is actually going on</v>

187
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:15.180
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have never had it better.</v>

188
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 1>My friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to leave you with a very</v>

189
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:20.130
<v Speaker 1>interesting data point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys like data.</v>

190
00:11:20.131 --> 00:11:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Who likes data?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

191
00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you some fucking data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people in America will die from a</v>

192
00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 1>coconut falling out of a tree and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting you on the head and killing you.</v>

193
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Then terrorism.</v>

194
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

195
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.590
<v Speaker 1>I see you tentative like is he fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious?</v>

196
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead fucking serious.</v>

197
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Kids seven to 11 watch more twitch east</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports than all the four major sports</v>

198
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 1>combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's data we are living through a</v>

199
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 1>totally different type of 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weirdest thing in the world was your</v>

200
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:04.411
<v Speaker 1>friend dated people online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now every single person's swipes to the</v>

201
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 1>left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 seven</v>

202
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.890
<v Speaker 1>and so the trends and our society have</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed and either you're going to sit</v>

203
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:17.470
<v Speaker 1>here and binary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a black and white conversation.</v>

204
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Either you're going to leave here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how fucking awesome it is and</v>

205
00:12:22.181 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 1>you're going to take full advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and be a winner or you're going to</v>

206
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 1>sit and dwell on all the negatives of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be a losing player.</v>

207
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not complicated.</v>

208
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun for me to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to lose.</v>

209
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.480
<v Speaker 1>I desperately want you to win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is on you.</v>

210
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Nobody else is in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people who deal with things</v>

211
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:47.170
<v Speaker 1>like the loss of their children or real</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

212
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting in dwelling about not</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting enough likes on fucking</v>

213
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting in dwelling about forces</v>

214
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:58.411
<v Speaker 1>that don't really have impact on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is time that this collective room and</v>

215
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 1>our space understands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the greatest golden era of not</v>

216
00:13:03.431 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 1>only business but life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're really,</v>

217
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 1>and I mean really need to fucking grab</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

218
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
