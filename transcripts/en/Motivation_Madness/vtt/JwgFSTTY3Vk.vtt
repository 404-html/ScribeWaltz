1
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>A person's strengths are often their</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest weaknesses into.</v>

2
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:21.321
<v Speaker 1>That also means that their weaknesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be their strengths.</v>

3
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I am weak in all those ways that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>listed.</v>

4
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't accept that.</v>

5
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't accept that I am what I am and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that</v>

6
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>is what I'm doing to be no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't accept that.</v>

7
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always fighting.</v>

8
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm struggling and I'm so hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrapping him,</v>

9
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>kicking and clawing at those weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cheap stock though,</v>

10
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>some days I win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some days I don't,</v>

11
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>but each and every day I'd get back up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I move forward</v>

12
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>with my fist clench toward the battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward the struggle.</v>

13
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this temporary,</v>

14
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>it may last for a minute or an hour or</v>
<v Speaker 1>day or even a year.</v>

15
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually it will subside</v>

16
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 1>and something else will take its place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I quit,</v>

17
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:04.161
<v Speaker 1>however it will last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go dot.</v>

20
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.890

<v Speaker 1>I've got to overcome those weaknesses</v>

21
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>and those shortfalls and those flaws</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I strive to be just a little bit</v>

22
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:34.731
<v Speaker 1>better today</v>

<v Speaker 2>if you can work through your pay,</v>

49
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm guaranteeing you on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to commit my very being to this</v>

50
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:39.990
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta,</v>

51
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I gotta breathe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to eat it.</v>

52
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.130
<v Speaker 2>I got sleep sweeper and until you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 2>you'll never be successful in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

54
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.320
<v Speaker 2>once you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee the world is yours.</v>

55
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Once you make yourself one single</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

56
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.880
<v Speaker 1>it's too self ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can go watch your life become</v>

57
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 1>you actually want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the very best for human beings</v>

58
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 1>is one that lives in the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your thoughts,</v>

59
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.520
<v Speaker 1>your words and your actions all as one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Not One day saying one thing and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the next stage,</v>

61
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:45.951
<v Speaker 1>doing something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking and wishing so badly that you</v>

62
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>could have something for them only to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give up on yourself before you even</v>

63
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you have to hope that good things</v>

64
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>will happen to you when you cannot trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

65
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>You can't rely on your own capabilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that you will show up and</v>

66
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>do what you said you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you're going to rely on luck</v>

67
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>and chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you build up your belief in</v>

68
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping the promises that you make to</v>

69
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life will change instantly.</v>

70
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about an agreement that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you made with somebody else.</v>

71
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:25.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm love talking about a contract</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't need anybody expecting you</v>

72
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>to keep your word for somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you have done it for you.</v>

73
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Why should anyone else ever believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

74
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Why should anyone else ever trust in</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

75
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.800
<v Speaker 1>If you cannot trust your son?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the moment that you actually start</v>

76
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.090
<v Speaker 1>doing the things that you said you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

77
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.440
<v Speaker 1>the moment you start actually acting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideas is the moment your life</v>

78
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>changes flow ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the moment where you access to</v>

79
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 1>power them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people never experience in their</v>

80
00:06:57.201 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gained the power to make anything</v>

81
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that you dream of become</v>

82
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you follow up your</v>

83
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you follow up a dream with real</v>

84
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then nothing can stop you.</v>

85
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can get in your way.</v>

86
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can really take you from your</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal and absolutely nobody can take away</v>

87
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>your goal from you other than yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is when you don't follow through speed.</v>

88
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Don't do the things that you said you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do that other people start to</v>

89
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 1>disappear in fail too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about your dream here.</v>

90
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about your passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not expecting everybody else to</v>

91
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:42.671
<v Speaker 1>show up and give us handouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give yourself a handout by following</v>

92
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>through with actions that you said you</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to do,</v>

93
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>that you know you needed to do that no</v>
<v Speaker 1>will take you to the next level.</v>

94
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>So stop treating your word like trash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop treating it like garbage,</v>

95
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>like something you could just throw</v>
<v Speaker 1>around saying one day that you can</v>

96
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 1>improve your relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem that you're going to be better</v>

97
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 1>socially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but saying that you're going to make</v>

98
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>progress in your career or that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to lose weight and get in shape</v>

99
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 1>and then the next day not do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and just give up on yourself.</v>

100
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Even if you went half way there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same damn thing.</v>

101
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Go all the way followed through with</v>
<v Speaker 1>real work,</v>

102
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.880
<v Speaker 1>real effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you can keep daydreaming and</v>

103
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:27.480
<v Speaker 1>escaping your dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can keep thinking that one day we'll</v>

104
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.340
<v Speaker 1>be real or you can actually step into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

105
00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:35.341
<v Speaker 1>Today you can make a real decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm real life position,</v>

106
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.130
<v Speaker 1>not a fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real choice to no longer daydream,</v>

107
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.920
<v Speaker 1>but to use your name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to step into your dream.</v>

108
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I heard my own trusted you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This no one else can approve of you</v>

109
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:50.080
<v Speaker 1>except for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to validate your dream.</v>

110
00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:54.820
<v Speaker 1>You have to validate your passion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to validate it with real work</v>

111
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.960
<v Speaker 1>and you have to follow with passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll drive determination and all such</v>

112
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:05.510
<v Speaker 1>thing as giving up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about you stop looking for other</v>

113
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 1>people scanning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

114
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 1>what's your guarantee success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your guarantee about reaching the</v>

115
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:19.611
<v Speaker 1>point where you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take you seriously?</v>

116
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously stop letting yourself now</v>

117
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.780
<v Speaker 1>because there is absolutely nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing in the world that feels better</v>

118
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.890
<v Speaker 1>than doing what you said you would.</v>

119
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Problem is everybody wants to be obese</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's time to do what real bees</v>

120

<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets excited.</v>

121
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.030
<v Speaker 2>He t the bull story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody wants to get up at three</v>

122
00:10:05.031 --> 00:10:09.610
<v Speaker 2>o'clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

123
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.520
<v Speaker 2>I was excited when I say I wake up at</v>
<v Speaker 2>three o'clock three o'clock</v>

124
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.260
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>

125
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Well you walk out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>popped up,</v>

126
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 2>fire it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who get some new information?</v>

127
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.170
<v Speaker 2>You're ready?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to be a beast.</v>

128
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 2>It turns time to do what bees do.</v>

129
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.223
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

130
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.860
<v Speaker 2>What's you have to understand is</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody that you're going to hear from</v>

131
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Eric Thomas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother got pregnant with me at 17</v>

132
00:10:38.831 --> 00:10:40.390
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school dropout,</v>

133
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 2>ate out of trash cans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to bed and building,</v>

134
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.720
<v Speaker 2>slept in cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multimillion company.</v>

135
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.210
<v Speaker 2>That's changing the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say America.</v>

136
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.290
<v Speaker 2>The world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

137
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Because not only do I want to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>beast,</v>

138
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.290
<v Speaker 2>if you follow my 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do what bees do.</v>

139
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.600
<v Speaker 2>You can't just say you want it.</v>

140
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.043
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

141
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Can't watch the video and say I want it</v>
<v Speaker 2>as bad as I want to breathe.</v>

142
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:20.170
<v Speaker 2>It's true to say it</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the sun comes up,</v>

143
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.750
<v Speaker 2>you've got all the books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got all the tapes,</v>

144
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.580
<v Speaker 2>you got all the access.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's time charts.</v>

145
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.460
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

146
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:38.420
<v Speaker 3>I haven't is essentially a decision that</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain made at some point in that</v>

147
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:42.370
<v Speaker 3>you made</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you stop making but continued</v>

148
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:47.380
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've heard that cheesy quote</v>

149
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:51.980
<v Speaker 3>about life being a journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

150
00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely you're not racing</v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere.</v>

151
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 3>She slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop looking around at what everyone</v>

152
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 3>else is doing and focus on where you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what's important to you.</v>

153
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.363
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

154
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.120
<v Speaker 3>We know from neurological studies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>every habit has three components.</v>

155
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.030
<v Speaker 3>There's a cue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like a trigger for the behavior</v>

156
00:12:18.031 --> 00:12:23.010
<v Speaker 3>to start and then there's the behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself and then finally a reward.</v>

157
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.290
<v Speaker 3>And for years when people thought about</v>
<v Speaker 3>habits,</v>

158
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.860
<v Speaker 3>they focused on the VP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what we know from all of these</v>

159
00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:32.130
<v Speaker 3>experiments is that it's the queue and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we'll warm.</v>

160
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.360
<v Speaker 3>What are the secrets to unlocking a got</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding how it works and more</v>

161
00:12:36.361 --> 00:12:41.361
<v Speaker 3>importantly to change it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you gain for assistance and how</v>

162
00:12:49.551 --> 00:12:51.950
<v Speaker 3>do you start to have more good days than</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad days?</v>

163
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.690
<v Speaker 3>You're going to hate this advice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it absolutely works.</v>

164
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:02.290
<v Speaker 3>You must come up with a morning routine</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you do every single morning or at</v>

165
00:13:05.241 --> 00:13:10.190
<v Speaker 3>least more and mornings than not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That puts you in control of yourself</v>

166
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.050
<v Speaker 3>then in control of your day.</v>

167
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.793
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

168
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.420
<v Speaker 3>We can choose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can choose to create new habits.</v>

169
00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:29.380
<v Speaker 3>We can choose to extinguish old habits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you understand how they work</v>

170
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:32.770
<v Speaker 3>according to studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to reshape these automatic</v>

171
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 3>behaviors and then you gain this control</v>
<v Speaker 3>over these parts of your life that</v>

172
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.240
<v Speaker 3>otherwise just feel sort of just at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just out of reach</v>

173
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.520
<v Speaker 3>and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up on time when that alarm goes</v>

174
00:13:49.521 --> 00:13:51.710
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your butt out of bed.</v>

175
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:52.551
<v Speaker 3>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

176
00:13:52.551 --> 00:13:53.121
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

177
00:13:53.121 --> 00:13:56.420
<v Speaker 3>one go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that important for persistence?</v>

178
00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.040
<v Speaker 3>The reason why is because the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>decision that you're making of the day</v>

179
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.860
<v Speaker 3>is to actually get up and get moving.</v>

180
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

181
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.600
<v Speaker 3>Means you are persistently bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 3>your excuses.</v>

182
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.750
<v Speaker 3>You are persistently vigor than feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>lazy,</v>

183
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 3>and you are persistently feeding the</v>
<v Speaker 3>feelings that typically stop.</v>

184
00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:25.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

185
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

186
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Where it is that your two priorities are</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your head.</v>

187
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why is because of</v>

188
00:14:40.551 --> 00:14:41.384
<v Speaker 3>persistence.</v>

189
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to</v>

190
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.100
<v Speaker 3>start off your day by getting up on</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

191
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.670
<v Speaker 3>figuring out your priorities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then getting to on them.</v>

192
00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Single biggest reason why people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad days is because they start them off</v>

193
00:15:01.841 --> 00:15:05.230
<v Speaker 3>by looking around at everybody else and</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing what they're doing.</v>

194
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.080
<v Speaker 3>Instead of having the focus and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline</v>

195
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.590
<v Speaker 3>to actually start your day off with you</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

196
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.633
<v Speaker 3>in troll,</v>

197
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.690
<v Speaker 1>get out</v>

198
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.130
<v Speaker 3>one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out your priorities and exercise.</v>

199
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 4>You've got to believe in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to believe in your abilities.</v>

200
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 4>You got to believe in your service,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your company,</v>

201
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.980
<v Speaker 4>your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unquestionably,</v>

202
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.550
<v Speaker 4>you must have faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

203
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:41.384
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

204
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.130
<v Speaker 4>It's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

205
00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.680
<v Speaker 4>Blight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's worth it.</v>

206
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:54.850
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
