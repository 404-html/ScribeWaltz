1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spend at least a week,</v>

2
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>a year where I go off to the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep us phd.</v>

3
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Theses and new things are going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the field.</v>

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>You'll believe the prime ingredient of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his success was his early fascination</v>

5
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>with computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand when you spend</v>

6
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>your time thinking intensely about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>field and how from a very young age,</v>

7
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's my cases?</v>

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 13 or 14 when I started to get</v>

9
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>that's where you can do great things is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your mind has really gotten into</v>

11
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:38.111
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

12
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>you understand that</v>

13
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 2>one of the ideas that excite you or is</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just customers?</v>

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Customers first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second is last a century a company.</v>

15
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 2>If you want to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe you should find a great</v>

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But today this was now lack opportunity</v>

17
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 2>that today if you want to be a Greek</v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 2>think about what problem you can solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the catch the opportunity.</v>

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 2>It's about solving the social risk</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

20
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because companies like Alibaba where</v>

21
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 2>brings so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for one opportunity</v>

22
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 2>that can make us lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a organization.</v>

23
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Who is the power power by ink to net was</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions and millions of smes with 400</v>

24
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 2>million consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of problem can solve and uh,</v>

25
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything you mentioned about cloud</v>

26
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 2>computing and talking about a more bio</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

27
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 2>anything that's happened in the USA is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to happen in China.</v>

28
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 3>There is an amazing degree to which</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's ambitions get beaten out of</v>

29
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 3>them in these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in these,</v>

30
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 3>in these top universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I look at what people thought my</v>

31
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 3>senior year in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was sort of like,</v>

32
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 3>we're very ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd all these ideas what they were</v>

33
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 3>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you looked at the same people at</v>

34
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 3>a sort of college plus five years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of nine years later,</v>

35
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing how much things have been</v>

36
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 3>ratcheted down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

37
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 3>I do think there's something problematic</v>
<v Speaker 3>where all the talented people go to</v>

38
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 3>these schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sort of evaluated on the same</v>

39
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.680
<v Speaker 3>terms and at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

40
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 3>at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of ambitions are beaten out of</v>

41
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know,</v>

42
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 3>probably the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that I think is even worse for</v>

43
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:17.900
<v Speaker 3>people than Harvard in this respect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

44
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 3>might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

45
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 3>might be Caltech where you have these</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant math,</v>

46
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 3>physics people and after four years</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're in the middle of your</v>

47
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're convinced that the most you can</v>

48
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 3>do with your life has become a blind</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineer at Lockheed.</v>

49
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 3>And maybe you can go into mid level</v>
<v Speaker 3>management 20 years later.</v>

50
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 3>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

51
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.600
<v Speaker 3>that sort of is characteristic of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what I think has happened and what,</v>

52
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I think we need to somehow find a</v>

53
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 3>way back to is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this idea that,</v>

54
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's not just a single track,</v>

55
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 3>that there are very different things you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can do.</v>

56
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question,</v>

57
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what truth do you know that nobody</v>

58
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:55.300
<v Speaker 3>agrees with you on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

59
00:02:55.301 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 3>the sort of career version of this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

60
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.750
<v Speaker 3>what are you really at that other people</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't that good at or,</v>

61
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.820
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a,</v>

62
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.310
<v Speaker 3>and that's somehow gets discouraged by</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

63
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.600
<v Speaker 3>by this incredible homogenization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.980
<v Speaker 4>And big ambitions get discouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that you think every way the EU,</v>

65
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.650
<v Speaker 4>then everyone runs true of all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suppose we decide we can make it in</v>

66
00:03:16.651 --> 00:03:19.140
<v Speaker 4>certain line and do things a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

67
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.420
<v Speaker 4>move ahead step by step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the kind of,</v>

68
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.220
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's always the ambition to be a</v>

69
00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:25.190
<v Speaker 4>founder that if that seems to be knocked</v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

70
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.900
<v Speaker 4>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both the institutions and the mindset</v>

71
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:32.010
<v Speaker 4>that permeates the institutions is</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost a denial that that ambition is</v>

72
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.900
<v Speaker 4>reasonable or even possible.</v>

73
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a sense that um,</v>

74
00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:37.680
<v Speaker 3>there are all these people who are ahead</v>
<v Speaker 3>of you.</v>

75
00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:41.040
<v Speaker 3>So there's always this sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people who are,</v>

76
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are much better or just as good as</v>

77
00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:45.780
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who are you to think that you can do</v>

78
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 3>anything on anything different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And obviously when everybody starts to</v>

79
00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:53.880
<v Speaker 3>think that nobody does anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in fact it becomes self fulfilling</v>

80
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:54.714
<v Speaker 3>once again,</v>

81
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>

82
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.510
<v Speaker 5>so much of the lesson that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I,</v>

83
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.990
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I've learned is I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really hard to decide to start a</v>

84
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:02.824
<v Speaker 5>company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

85
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.641
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>facebook,</v>

86
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 5>I didn't start it to start a company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started it because I really wanted</v>

87
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 5>this thing personally and I believed</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it should exist globally.</v>

88
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 5>Although I wasn't quite sure that that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would be able to play a role in doing</v>

89
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was mostly just through kind of like</v>

90
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 5>wanting to build it and having it be</v>
<v Speaker 5>this hobby and getting people around me</v>

91
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 5>excited that it eventually kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>evolved into and got the momentum to</v>

92
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 5>become a company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I never really understood the</v>

93
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 5>psychology of deciding that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>start a company before you understand</v>

94
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 5>what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this gets back to the question of</v>

95
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 5>why did we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why did we first open it at colleges</v>

96
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 5>that had competitors?</v>

97
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 5>I have this big fear I think of getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>locked into doing things that aren't</v>

98
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 5>actually the most impactful things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean to me this is like the trait that</v>

99
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:49.231
<v Speaker 5>entrepreneurs have is they just have</v>
<v Speaker 5>this like laser like ability to go find</v>

100
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 5>where they can have the most impact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know when you take on a new</v>

101
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 5>project,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you hire people or start a</v>

102
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 5>company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing that project.</v>

103
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 5>And I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are ways,</v>

104
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 5>there are obviously different ways that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can exit and all that.</v>

105
00:04:59.051 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

106
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 5>I think having the flexibility to</v>
<v Speaker 5>explore a lot of different things,</v>

107
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:05.470
<v Speaker 5>which you can do when you're in college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the amazing things about</v>

108
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 5>being in college is you can work on all</v>
<v Speaker 5>these hobbies,</v>

109
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

110
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and code a lot of stuff and try a lot of</v>

111
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 5>different things.</v>

112
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 5>It's this amazing flexibility that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think most people take for granted.</v>

113
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 5>And once you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

114
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to start a company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to do it with someone else,</v>

115
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 5>you immediately now need to convince</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone else if you want to change your</v>

116
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 5>mind on something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think people really undervalue the</v>

117
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 5>option value and flexibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think explore what you want to do</v>

118
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 5>before committing is really like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the key thing and keep yourself</v>

119
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 5>flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

120
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 5>and no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that that's,</v>

121
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean agree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think you can definitely do that</v>

122
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:38.920
<v Speaker 5>within the framework of a company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think you have to be wary about</v>

123
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.910
<v Speaker 5>starting a company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

124
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 5>to rigidly because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to change what you do.</v>

125
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people talk about pivots all the time as</v>

126
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 5>if it's like it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't your thing didn't work.</v>

127
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 5>So you pivoted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Facebook pivoted many times.</v>

128
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.611
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just,</v>

129
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:52.181
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

130
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 5>we kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were college and then we were not</v>

131
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 5>college and then we were just a website</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then we were a platform.</v>

132
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're going to change what you do.</v>

133
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 5>There's another word for the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>pivots you were talking about.</v>

134
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:03.570
<v Speaker 5>Expansions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hell No.</v>

135
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.640
<v Speaker 5>What people usually mean by pivoting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

136
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>flexibility.</v>

137
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.670
<v Speaker 6>Follow your instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very easy to say.</v>

138
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.150
<v Speaker 6>Incredibly difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A little more context.</v>

139
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.700
<v Speaker 6>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they're wondering about what they</v>

140
00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:25.030
<v Speaker 6>should do after college or after</v>
<v Speaker 6>university,</v>

141
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.020
<v Speaker 6>you have the weight of expectations on</v>
<v Speaker 6>your shoulders.</v>

142
00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:32.170
<v Speaker 6>You have college bills that you might</v>
<v Speaker 6>have to pay.</v>

143
00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:37.171
<v Speaker 6>You have parents who have expectations</v>
<v Speaker 6>for you in a particular direction.</v>

144
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.380
<v Speaker 6>And whether you like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>subconsciously you carry all that stuff</v>

145
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:44.260
<v Speaker 6>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you want to go in a different</v>

146
00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:47.980
<v Speaker 6>direction from what you've been spent</v>
<v Speaker 6>the previous 20,</v>

147
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:51.250
<v Speaker 6>25 years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he realized almost being programmed to</v>

148
00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:54.010
<v Speaker 6>go and do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a very difficult thing to do.</v>

149
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.740
<v Speaker 6>What matters eventually is the quality</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the investment decisions made and the</v>

150
00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:06.490
<v Speaker 6>acuity with with which those are made.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's somewhat similar to the analogy</v>

151
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:11.491
<v Speaker 6>that people used to make when newspapers</v>
<v Speaker 6>were read more frequently than they are</v>

152
00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:14.470
<v Speaker 6>today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is not to get sucked up into</v>

153
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:16.180
<v Speaker 6>believing your own headlines.</v>

154
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.230
<v Speaker 6>And so I think especially in today's</v>
<v Speaker 6>era,</v>

155
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.260
<v Speaker 6>and humility also goes along way</v>
<v Speaker 6>particularly in which if you don't make</v>

156
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.980
<v Speaker 6>decisions correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can a hand you out a right royal</v>

157
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:31.060
<v Speaker 6>spanking?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

158
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:36.061
<v Speaker 6>no matter how high your public profile,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you believe that there'll be another</v>

159
00:07:37.121 --> 00:07:40.960
<v Speaker 6>steve job in this five to 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

160
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:45.961
<v Speaker 6>know any more than I believe there'll be</v>
<v Speaker 6>another Larry Page or mark Zuckerberg or</v>

161
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:48.670
<v Speaker 6>Bill Gates.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're each very distinctive</v>

162
00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:49.960
<v Speaker 6>personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

163
00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:53.320
<v Speaker 6>if the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is there somebody whose name we don't</v>

164
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:57.580
<v Speaker 6>know today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who 20 years from now will be very well</v>

165
00:07:57.581 --> 00:08:00.640
<v Speaker 6>known because of a company that he or</v>
<v Speaker 6>she started?</v>

166
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.560
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes I do.</v>

167
00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:06.160
<v Speaker 6>I think sequoia is the preeminent</v>
<v Speaker 6>venture firm.</v>

168
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.660
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

169
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.900
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I always feel we're always one</v>

170
00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 6>step away from going out of business and</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

171
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.640
<v Speaker 6>that we can never take anything for</v>
<v Speaker 6>granted and that we're only as good as</v>

172
00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:22.780
<v Speaker 6>our next investment.</v>

173
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.660
<v Speaker 6>The advice that people should follow</v>
<v Speaker 6>their instincts,</v>

174
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.910
<v Speaker 6>whether I could say a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 6>about that.</v>

175
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.150
<v Speaker 6>I think it helps if you try and enter an</v>
<v Speaker 6>environment where you think you can</v>

176
00:08:35.741 --> 00:08:39.130
<v Speaker 6>learn a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether that's inside the organization.</v>

177
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.260
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have to have to be a company.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It can be,</v>

178
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be,</v>

179
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.700
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some other organization or around people</v>

180
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.020
<v Speaker 6>that you particularly admire that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>can learn a lot from.</v>

181
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 6>And I think that just helps expand</v>
<v Speaker 6>horizons.</v>

182
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.610
<v Speaker 6>So also gives the individual a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 6>what excellence is really like how</v>

183
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 6>realistic is it for a company to do b to</v>
<v Speaker 6>c and B,</v>

184
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 6>two b at the same time?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

185
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

186
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there examples of companies</v>
<v Speaker 6>that have pulled it off.</v>

187
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just think right at the beginning you</v>

188
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 6>have to concentrate on doing one thing</v>
<v Speaker 6>super well on.</v>

189
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:21.770
<v Speaker 6>Once you've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

190
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 6>the second thing becomes easier,</v>
<v Speaker 6>particularly if you're dealing with,</v>

191
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 6>it's one thing to sell precisely the</v>
<v Speaker 6>same product to both audiences.</v>

192
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 6>And if you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bless your heart.</v>

193
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:32.581
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

194
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

195
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.750
<v Speaker 6>it's a good thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's very [inaudible] you've</v>

196
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 6>got to tailor the product differently.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's a very dangerous thing</v>

197
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:42.490
<v Speaker 6>for a company to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

198
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 6>right at the start,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

199
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:49.281
<v Speaker 6>it's no coincidence apple under Steve</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jobs was not prepared to compromise a</v>

200
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:54.270
<v Speaker 6>change and alter its products to please</v>
<v Speaker 6>corporations.</v>

201
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:55.810
<v Speaker 6>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

202
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>build products and if corporations,</v>

203
00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:00.600
<v Speaker 6>and it's wanted to buy them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so be it,</v>

204
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.430
<v Speaker 6>but they weren't going to come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with special products.</v>

205
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 6>So it was an approach that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

206
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 6>obviously served them very well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then as you know,</v>

207
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:13.470
<v Speaker 6>there are plenty of examples of other</v>
<v Speaker 6>companies that have over time,</v>

208
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>succeeded with two different sorts of</v>

209
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:17.970
<v Speaker 6>distribution channels.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Plenty of examples of that.</v>

210
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 6>But at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think simplicity is a virtue</v>

211
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 2>cause I think that's really important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for young people to actually</v>

212
00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 2>do that self assessment and find that</v>
<v Speaker 2>passion.</v>

213
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.490
<v Speaker 2>Do you have any advice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think many,</v>

214
00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 2>many kids and many grownups do figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

215
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over time what their passions are.</v>

216
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes we let our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that hard.</v>

217
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:44.781
<v Speaker 2>I think what happens though sometimes is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we let our intellectual selves</v>

218
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.760
<v Speaker 2>overrule those passions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

219
00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:50.250
<v Speaker 2>and so that's what needs to be guarded</v>
<v Speaker 2>against.</v>

220
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids are very good about knowing what</v>

221
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:55.650
<v Speaker 2>their passions are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that because I think I've seen</v>

222
00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:58.680
<v Speaker 2>you described this way that you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>always maintained that sense of wonder.</v>

223
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what kids have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we lose it somehow along the way.</v>

224
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a gift.</v>

225
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:06.120
<v Speaker 2>If you can keep your childlike sense of</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonder,</v>

226
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it helps with creativity,</v>

227
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.950
<v Speaker 2>it helps to have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

228
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you laugh more and play more if you keep</v>

229
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:15.840
<v Speaker 2>that childlike sense of wonder.</v>

230
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.130
<v Speaker 2>What we're really focused on is thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>long term,</v>

231
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.270
<v Speaker 2>putting the customer at the center of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our universe and inventing.</v>

232
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.830
<v Speaker 2>Those are the three big ideas I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that you can invent on behalf of</v>

233
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 2>customers unless you're willing to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>long term because a lot of invention</v>

234
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to invent,</v>

235
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 2>it means you're going to experiment to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to think long term.</v>

236
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.430
<v Speaker 2>So these three ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>customer centricity,</v>

237
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.520
<v Speaker 2>long term thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a passion for invention,</v>

238
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 2>those go together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how we do it.</v>

239
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of fun doing it that way.</v>

240
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Amazing about your successes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you actually,</v>

241
00:11:51.971 --> 00:11:54.210
<v Speaker 2>your timing was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does a,</v>

242
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 2>an innovator actually identify that</v>
<v Speaker 2>historical momentum,</v>

243
00:11:57.101 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 2>that Kitty Hawk moment you breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you recognize what was happening with</v>

244
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:01.300
<v Speaker 2>the Internet and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

245
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a room for me to start</v>
<v Speaker 2>with books and then move on.</v>

246
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you find the time and the</v>

247
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 2>momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Zeitgeists,</v>

248
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.690
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody has their own passion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own thing that they're interested</v>

249
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're very alert to the things</v>

250
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are in the sphere of influence of</v>

251
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:23.170
<v Speaker 2>that passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your passion has led you to change</v>

252
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly with Amazon,</v>

253
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.170
<v Speaker 2>but yet you've got blue origin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got pesos,</v>

254
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.130
<v Speaker 2>explorations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't somebody like you just rest on</v>

255
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 2>your loral go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

256
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:33.820
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 2>I love what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also have four kids.</v>

258
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I have wife that I love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of passions and interests.</v>

259
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

260
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.890
<v Speaker 2>one of them is the pace of change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

261
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I love the fact that I get to work with</v>
<v Speaker 2>these smart,</v>

262
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.650
<v Speaker 2>big smart teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

263
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 2>the people I work with are so smart and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>

264
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 2>they're self selected for loving to</v>
<v Speaker 2>invent on behalf of customers.</v>

265
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:04.240
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

267
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love every moment of every day.</v>

268
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why they call it work.</v>

269
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.863
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

270
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 2>there's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are things that I,</v>

271
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:17.140
<v Speaker 2>that I don't enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm really objective about it and</v>

272
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so lucky to be working alongside all</v>

273
00:13:21.911 --> 00:13:25.060
<v Speaker 2>these passionate people and I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you remain nimble?</v>

274
00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Because there is somebody in their dorm</v>
<v Speaker 2>room who could eat you up for lunch the</v>

275
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:29.620
<v Speaker 2>next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

276
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.080
<v Speaker 2>my belief on this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

277
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:34.820
<v Speaker 2>that's completely correct and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

278
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.240
<v Speaker 2>it can never show anybody that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't happen.</v>

279
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:42.750
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you have a customer</v>
<v Speaker 2>centric culture that cures a lot of ills</v>

280
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.310
<v Speaker 2>because we wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

281
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 2>let's say you're the leader in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular arena,</v>

282
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 2>if you're competitor focused and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>already the leader,</v>

283
00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 2>then where does your energy come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're customer focused and</v>

284
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:03.850
<v Speaker 2>you're already the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>customers are never satisfied.</v>

285
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.790
<v Speaker 2>So you always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're customer focused,</v>

286
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:11.200
<v Speaker 2>you're always waking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can we make that customer say,</v>

287
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:13.120
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we,</v>

288
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our energy,</v>

289
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:17.890
<v Speaker 2>our passion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to impress our customers.</v>

290
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 2>We want them to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

291
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:24.180
<v Speaker 2>is that kind of divine discontent comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>from observing customers and noticing</v>

292
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:26.051
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

293
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:26.600
<v Speaker 2>things can,</v>

294
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.900
<v Speaker 3>so what was the sense that people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's really hard to come with the</v>

295
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.620
<v Speaker 3>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the answers have already been</v>

296
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:37.310
<v Speaker 3>discovered in one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's not the case.</v>

297
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:38.360
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sort of,</v>

298
00:14:38.361 --> 00:14:41.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sort of divided things up into</v>

299
00:14:41.511 --> 00:14:43.670
<v Speaker 3>conventions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are things everybody knows to be</v>

300
00:14:43.671 --> 00:14:45.380
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other extreme,</v>

301
00:14:45.381 --> 00:14:48.530
<v Speaker 3>there are mysteries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that nobody can figure out and in</v>

302
00:14:48.531 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 3>between are these things that I call</v>
<v Speaker 3>secrets are things that you could figure</v>

303
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:54.500
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hard,</v>

304
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.630
<v Speaker 3>but if you really work at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

305
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.790
<v Speaker 3>you could figure something out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

306
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:01.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one one thought that I have is that</v>

307
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 3>there are many secrets left to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered.</v>

308
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:09.490
<v Speaker 3>I actually think that this is a somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonconventional view because I think the</v>

309
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:13.920
<v Speaker 3>conventional view is that most secrets</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been discovered and that there's</v>

310
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.470
<v Speaker 3>nothing new to find.</v>

311
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

312
00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.170
<v Speaker 3>and this is certainly is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is true,</v>

313
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:22.730
<v Speaker 3>certainly certain domains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think most things are not like</v>

314
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:24.980
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there are a lot of fields</v>

315
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:27.910
<v Speaker 3>where new things can be found.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

316
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.240
<v Speaker 3>we're often discouraged by sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>version of globalization.</v>

317
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:32.810
<v Speaker 3>We think they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

318
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 3>7 billion other people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there will always be someone who</v>

319
00:15:36.321 --> 00:15:38.780
<v Speaker 3>will have already thought of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if no one will have thought of it</v>

320
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:41.570
<v Speaker 3>before us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it must be almost impossibly hard.</v>

321
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.200
<v Speaker 3>And so it ends up being this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>self fulfilling thing where we don't</v>

322
00:15:45.201 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 3>even try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

323
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.990
<v Speaker 3>I do think the only people who will</v>
<v Speaker 3>discover secrets are people who work at</v>

324
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:52.760
<v Speaker 3>it and who tried doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

325
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 3>I think that many of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

326
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.130
<v Speaker 3>great companies have something like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the core that's,</v>

327
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 3>it's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some domain of knowledge,</v>

328
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:03.720
<v Speaker 3>some area where people think they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out a lot more at,</v>

329
00:16:03.721 --> 00:16:04.970
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at paypal,</v>

330
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.980
<v Speaker 3>we were very interested in this and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>intersection of money and cryptography.</v>

331
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Could you create a new digital currency</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the Internet?</v>

332
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

333
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.870
<v Speaker 3>it was a fairly idiosyncratic field</v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

334
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small number of people working on it.</v>

335
00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:20.024
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

336
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 3>financial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cryptography community,</v>

337
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could sort of understand the</v>

338
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 3>field you'd get to the frontiers and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>

339
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:28.904
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

340
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.120
<v Speaker 3>you could explore it quite a bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

341
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

342
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.810
<v Speaker 3>so I think the second idea I want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave you with is there still is a</v>

343
00:16:35.811 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 3>frontier left and the frontiers not</v>
<v Speaker 3>infinitely far away.</v>

344
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.200
<v Speaker 3>There's certain places where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>frontier has been close of</v>

345
00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:45.650
<v Speaker 3>geographically it's kind of closed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are many places where you can</v>

346
00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:48.140
<v Speaker 3>still get to the frontier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's actually,</v>

347
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are many directions you can go</v>

348
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:53.540
<v Speaker 3>with a frontier as close and where</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot left to be left to be</v>

349
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:54.230
<v Speaker 3>discovered.</v>

350
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.210
<v Speaker 7>You have developed as at least profile</v>
<v Speaker 7>as a young man in a hurry.</v>

351
00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.830
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all the rough elbows at,</v>

352
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.060
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's improved,</v>

353
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.890
<v Speaker 7>if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how should I put it?</v>

354
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.000
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we look at all of the cities and we know</v>

355
00:17:10.001 --> 00:17:12.400
<v Speaker 7>that the transportation systems there</v>
<v Speaker 7>are just not,</v>

356
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.980
<v Speaker 7>they're not serving everybody's needs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

357
00:17:14.981 --> 00:17:17.470
<v Speaker 7>even here in New York with a great mass</v>
<v Speaker 7>transit system,</v>

358
00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:22.540
<v Speaker 7>there are still two and a half million</v>
<v Speaker 7>cars going over those bridges every day.</v>

359
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.220
<v Speaker 7>And so we just believe we can help the</v>
<v Speaker 7>city do better.</v>

360
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.400
<v Speaker 7>I guess most,</v>
<v Speaker 7>most successful entrepreneurs are not</v>

361
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:35.430
<v Speaker 7>waiting for it to come to their success</v>
<v Speaker 7>and not waiting for progress.</v>

362
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.530
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we are generally a little bit,</v>

363
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.550
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>forward leaning when it comes to trying</v>

364
00:17:41.551 --> 00:17:46.390
<v Speaker 7>to make progress happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For me it's about problem solving and</v>

365
00:17:46.391 --> 00:17:51.391
<v Speaker 7>loving to solve problems.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so if you are passionate about</v>

366
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:52.960
<v Speaker 7>solving problems,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and in some,</v>

367
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 7>sometimes I just like to describe this</v>
<v Speaker 7>as like imagine a really great math</v>

368
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:01.170
<v Speaker 7>professor with no problems to solve,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

369
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.050
<v Speaker 7>The great a great math professors,</v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody who,</v>

370
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.010
<v Speaker 7>who wants the hardest problems,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who wants to solve them and love solving</v>

371
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:10.260
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's Kinda how I feel about my work.</v>

372
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 7>And so it's not about a man in a hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's more about really interesting</v>

373
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:20.070
<v Speaker 7>problems in the world and how do you</v>
<v Speaker 7>lean into them and solve things that</v>

374
00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:22.350
<v Speaker 7>people maybe thought weren't even</v>
<v Speaker 7>possible to solve.</v>

375
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:23.640
<v Speaker 7>And that's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

376
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:27.370
<v Speaker 7>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we don't really aspire to be somebody</v>

377
00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:32.650
<v Speaker 7>other than ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And part of being ourselves as sort of</v>

378
00:18:32.651 --> 00:18:34.990
<v Speaker 7>reimagining the way things could be</v>
<v Speaker 7>done.</v>

379
00:18:34.991 --> 00:18:38.260
<v Speaker 7>So we like to take the impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We like to take the old way of doing</v>

380
00:18:38.261 --> 00:18:41.350
<v Speaker 7>things and just completely change it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's part of who we are.</v>

381
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.860
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I mean there are great ceos,</v>

382
00:18:44.861 --> 00:18:47.020
<v Speaker 7>great founders,</v>
<v Speaker 7>great leaders out there and there's,</v>

383
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.750
<v Speaker 7>there's something to learn from all of</v>
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>

384
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.100
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's something to learn from the ones</v>

385
00:18:51.101 --> 00:18:53.590
<v Speaker 7>that aren't great too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like again,</v>

386
00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:56.200
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everybody sees success,</v>

387
00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:59.860
<v Speaker 7>they see failure and we see that</v>
<v Speaker 7>personally and we should learn from it.</v>

388
00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:02.560
<v Speaker 7>But why not learn from other people's</v>
<v Speaker 7>success and failure?</v>

389
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.760
<v Speaker 7>There's something to learn from all of</v>
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>

390
00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.350
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it depends how you look at it,</v>

391
00:19:05.351 --> 00:19:10.150
<v Speaker 7>but when you have sort of this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this problem solving culture,</v>

392
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.120
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the core group sort of depends on the</v>

393
00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:17.050
<v Speaker 7>problem that's being solved.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so it's very dynamic what that core</v>

394
00:19:17.051 --> 00:19:19.410
<v Speaker 7>group is and on what problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

395
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.500
<v Speaker 7>I have 10,</v>
<v Speaker 7>11 direct reports and then depending on</v>

396
00:19:23.501 --> 00:19:26.770
<v Speaker 7>what the problems of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>our can determine how many of those</v>

397
00:19:26.771 --> 00:19:28.990
<v Speaker 7>folks are in a particular problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And by the way,</v>

398
00:19:28.991 --> 00:19:31.000
<v Speaker 7>a lot of problems getting solved that</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not involved in.</v>

399
00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.450
<v Speaker 7>And so figuring out what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which ones that you go into,</v>

400
00:19:34.451 --> 00:19:36.430
<v Speaker 7>how do you prioritize it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

401
00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.540
<v Speaker 7>how do you get to the future faster?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is is one of the things we spend a lot</v>

402
00:19:40.541 --> 00:19:41.860
<v Speaker 7>of times sort of architecting</v>

403
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.620
<v Speaker 8>silicon valley and the sort of the state</v>
<v Speaker 8>of Silicon Valley.</v>

404
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.980
<v Speaker 8>Do you think it's at a high point of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of invention right now or to plateau or</v>

405
00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:52.060
<v Speaker 8>at a low point or,</v>

406
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.780
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think they're jumping off.</v>

407
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.430
<v Speaker 7>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it reminds me like I,</v>

408
00:19:55.431 --> 00:19:55.881
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

409
00:19:55.881 --> 00:20:00.881
<v Speaker 7>I've been an entrepreneur since the mid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>late nineties and I remember in 2001 I</v>

410
00:20:02.541 --> 00:20:06.320
<v Speaker 7>was raising money.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is the host raising money in the</v>

411
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.590
<v Speaker 7>fall of 2001 for a networking software</v>
<v Speaker 7>company.</v>

412
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.040
<v Speaker 7>And I remember going to one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one of the restaurants in Palo Alto,</v>

413
00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:19.400
<v Speaker 7>which used to be bustling and like you'd</v>
<v Speaker 7>have to book,</v>

414
00:20:19.401 --> 00:20:22.610
<v Speaker 7>like get a reservation like a month</v>
<v Speaker 7>ahead of time or something.</v>

415
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.470
<v Speaker 7>And it was empty.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like tumbleweeds.</v>

416
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:29.770
<v Speaker 7>And I remember a vc telling me that all</v>
<v Speaker 7>the things that could be invented is</v>

417
00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:33.590
<v Speaker 7>2001,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all the things that could be invented in</v>

418
00:20:33.591 --> 00:20:37.940
<v Speaker 7>software had been invented and that</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was no more innovation left and</v>

419
00:20:37.941 --> 00:20:41.270
<v Speaker 7>software and right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that irrational sort of,</v>

420
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.970
<v Speaker 7>there's irrational exuberance and</v>
<v Speaker 7>irrational pessimism.</v>

421
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm just generally an optimist.</v>

422
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:51.370
<v Speaker 7>I just think there's just problems to be</v>
<v Speaker 7>solved everywhere.</v>

423
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 7>And once you solve them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you already see what's,</v>

424
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:54.840
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

425
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.810
<v Speaker 7>I'd like to say boredom is only the</v>
<v Speaker 7>result of a lack of imagination.</v>

426
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.110
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the minute you solve one thing,</v>

427
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:05.560
<v Speaker 7>you just sit down for a few minutes and</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you come up with like 10 more</v>

428
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:07.150
<v Speaker 7>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

429
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.700
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I think I'm an optimist.</v>

430
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.920
<v Speaker 7>Like there's just so much more to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

431
00:21:11.921 --> 00:21:15.190
<v Speaker 7>I think what's very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and maybe this is because of our global</v>

432
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:20.191
<v Speaker 7>reach and just where we've been is</v>
<v Speaker 7>silicon valley I think has been sort of</v>

433
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.930
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the North Star for innovation or,</v>

434
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.250
<v Speaker 7>or,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or the hub of innovation globally.</v>

435
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.520
<v Speaker 7>And I think that is no longer going to</v>
<v Speaker 7>be a thing.</v>

436
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:35.440
<v Speaker 7>I think if we go five years out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to start to see hubs of</v>

437
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:37.990
<v Speaker 7>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is about to be real,</v>

438
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.840
<v Speaker 7>at least with a couple major ones.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

439
00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:40.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

440
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.110
<v Speaker 8>Was going to ask you one more question.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Was there a time was up,</v>

441
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.370
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

442
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.100
<v Speaker 8>you're worth a lot of money now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's the most expensive thing you've</v>

443
00:21:46.101 --> 00:21:46.934
<v Speaker 8>bought?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hmm.</v>

444
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.180
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think what a lot of people don't know</v>

445
00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.880
<v Speaker 7>is that I've never sold a single uber</v>
<v Speaker 7>share.</v>

446
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.670
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

447
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.630
<v Speaker 7>the most expensive thing I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I bought before uber started and it's my</v>

448
00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:00.464
<v Speaker 7>home</v>

449
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.990
<v Speaker 8>and it was right around a million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

450
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.410
<v Speaker 8>So I got a mortgage in fact that you</v>
