1
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes business education today,</v>

2
00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and I see it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids come out of college,</v>

3
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>the best colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wharton and Harvard and Stanford and</v>

4
00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>some of the great business schools and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come out and they won't have</v>

5
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>practical experience is too many case</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies that aren't practical.</v>

6
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ask,</v>

7
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:25.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids that are 16 to 18 years old to make</v>

8
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 1>$100,000 debt decisions when they go off</v>
<v Speaker 1>to university and they're not prepared</v>

9
00:00:30.761 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what they're getting</v>

10
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>themselves into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just assume,</v>

11
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pay for years of education</v>

12
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:38.860
<v Speaker 1>to 25,000 a pop and when I come out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side,</v>

13
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:42.220
<v Speaker 1>somehow we'll be able to pay it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not how life works anymore.</v>

14
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 2>There's no need even to have a college</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree at all or even high school.</v>

15
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody graduated from a great</v>

16
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 2>university that maybe in indy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that may be an indication that they will</v>

17
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 2>be capable of great things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not necessarily the case.</v>

18
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at say people like Bill</v>

19
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Gates or Larry Ellison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Jobs,</v>

20
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 2>these guys didn't graduate from college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you had a chance to hire them,</v>

21
00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 2>of course I would be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

22
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.750
<v Speaker 2>I think having the flexibility to</v>
<v Speaker 2>explore a lot of different things which</v>

23
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 2>you can do when you're in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the amazing things about</v>

24
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:24.020
<v Speaker 2>being in college is you can work on all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these hobbies and encode a lot of stuff</v>

25
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 2>and try a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this amazing flexibility that I</v>

26
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 2>think most people take for granted and</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you decide,</v>

27
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start a company,</v>

28
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it with someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you immediately now need to convince</v>

29
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 2>someone else if you want to change your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind on something.</v>

30
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 2>And I think people really undervalue the</v>
<v Speaker 2>option value and flexibility.</v>

31
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 2>I think explore what you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>before committing is really like the key</v>

32
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:48.461
<v Speaker 2>thing and keep yourself flexible and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's agreed.</v>

33
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's actually kind of funny.</v>

34
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I like if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is education?</v>

35
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Like you're basically downloading data</v>
<v Speaker 2>and algorithms into your brain and it's,</v>

36
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually amazingly bad in</v>

37
00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:04.420
<v Speaker 2>conventional education because like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be like this huge tour</v>

38
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Speaker 2>almost standing up there kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>lecturing at people and they've done the</v>

39
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 2>same lecturer or 20 years in a row and</v>
<v Speaker 2>are very excited about it and in fact I</v>

40
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 2>think a lot of things that people learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably there's no point in learning</v>

41
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 2>because they never used them in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>future because a lot of kids are in</v>

42
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.870
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of puzzled as to why they're there.</v>

43
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 3>The people who are doing the work that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we care about are figuring out what to</v>

44
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 3>do next,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not following the person who told them</v>

45
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 3>what to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with most colleges is</v>

46
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 3>they are high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with more binge drinking.</v>

47
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 3>The entire purpose of a university is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you a foundation to fail.</v>

48
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Not a foundation to get an a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you graduated from college,</v>

49
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 3>straight a's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to do some serious soul</v>

50
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 3>searching as to why you chose to spend</v>
<v Speaker 3>your time doing that.</v>

51
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.250
<v Speaker 1>A student's work for the students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The C students run the businesses and</v>

52
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>that these students dedicate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>

53
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like the newspaper</v>

54
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 4>industry ripe more printing presses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more big buildings,</v>

55
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes us look grander.</v>

56
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.370
<v Speaker 4>We have brains that we're putting them</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>

57
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.960
<v Speaker 4>There's there's a point of diminishing</v>
<v Speaker 4>returns in terms of what it's worth for</v>

58
00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 4>a college education and how much debt</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're willing to saddle yourself with.</v>

59
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people fall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people have follow is</v>

60
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.571
<v Speaker 5>generally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If not,</v>

61
00:03:18.571 --> 00:03:21.300
<v Speaker 5>we'd have problems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have too many entrepreneurs.</v>

62
00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:24.120
<v Speaker 5>We have so many successful people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look how many people go into business</v>

63
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:27.390
<v Speaker 5>classes and everything you needed was in</v>
<v Speaker 5>that actual business class.</v>

64
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 5>In that book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'd be too many successful business</v>

65
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.344
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

66
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.510
<v Speaker 5>How many people graduate?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matter of fact,</v>

67
00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:40.160
<v Speaker 5>the professor wouldn't have the time to</v>
<v Speaker 5>sit there and teach you that knows this</v>

68
00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:42.590
<v Speaker 5>book them near verbatim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>page by page.</v>

69
00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:43.250
<v Speaker 5>He knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

70
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.110
<v Speaker 5>Because he'd be an entrepreneur.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He too busy.</v>

71
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing way too much right now because</v>

72
00:03:47.751 --> 00:03:52.310
<v Speaker 5>I got the palm trees and then we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We sell it so much stuff that I'm doing</v>

73
00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:56.570
<v Speaker 5>that I ain't quite got time to teach</v>
<v Speaker 5>them about class right now because I'm</v>

74
00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 5>winning</v>

75
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.070
<v Speaker 4>and so when you walk into a board room</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a bunch of guys in suits who all</v>

76
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 4>went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fine.</v>

77
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean because they read a bunch of</v>

78
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:08.570
<v Speaker 6>words.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've lived a bunch of life.</v>

79
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're more degree,</v>

80
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 6>doesn't intimidate you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It kinda evens is out whether they know</v>

81
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 6>it and not get that self esteem from</v>
<v Speaker 6>seriously.</v>

82
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 6>I mean most mom first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then just living life like you know,</v>

83
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 6>being in real situations and happened to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be a person of high integrity and</v>

84
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 6>honesty and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you never embarrassed yourself.</v>

85
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 6>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd ever walked in and said,</v>

86
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 6>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody thinks I'm ignorant here.</v>

87
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't feel ignorant right now.</v>

88
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt like I came up in this situation</v>

89
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.100
<v Speaker 6>or a time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

90
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 6>where I wasn't afforded certain</v>
<v Speaker 6>opportunities and if afforded</v>

91
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.990
<v Speaker 6>opportunities I could be oprah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>could be a Bill Gates,</v>

92
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 6>I could be Warren Buffet.</v>

93
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.610
<v Speaker 7>In my experience in business,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there is very little difference.</v>

94
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.150
<v Speaker 7>If any,</v>
<v Speaker 7>between a very high price business</v>

95
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:10.050
<v Speaker 7>education and what's available a lot for</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot less money.</v>

96
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.780
<v Speaker 7>I went to the University of Nebraska at</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lincoln.</v>

97
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 7>I last year in college.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I went to wharton for a couple years</v>

98
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.523
<v Speaker 7>before that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

99
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.580
<v Speaker 7>I learned just as much as university</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nebraska as I did at wharton at indeed a</v>

100
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 7>big product in the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But an awful lot of it is,</v>

101
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.260
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>

102
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.800
<v Speaker 7>is self.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The self taught it isn't necessary to</v>

103
00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:33.801
<v Speaker 7>pay 30 or $35,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I go to some big name school to get the</v>

104
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:36.900
<v Speaker 7>education at all.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

105
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.700
<v Speaker 7>if you're going to learn accounting,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you're going to,</v>

106
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.490
<v Speaker 7>which is the probably the most important</v>
<v Speaker 7>course you'd taken business,</v>

107
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.220
<v Speaker 7>you're gonna learn to count.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can learn accounting absolutely as</v>

108
00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 7>well in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 7>going to you all.</v>

109
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.150
<v Speaker 7>It was going to Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

110
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.980
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I see,</v>

111
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.130
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would,</v>

112
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.510
<v Speaker 7>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I bet on that.</v>

113
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.570
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I wouldn't run up huge bells</v>

114
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 8>and education is very good at training</v>
<v Speaker 8>people to do the same things that we've</v>

115
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 8>done over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I think there's always a question</v>

116
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 8>what the nature of the educational good</v>
<v Speaker 8>is.</v>

117
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.380
<v Speaker 8>A,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can say it's a,</v>

118
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 8>it's an investment.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Good.</v>

119
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 8>We're investing in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can say it's a consumption good.</v>

120
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:18.230
<v Speaker 8>Like college is a four year party,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

121
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 8>I think most of the parents and students</v>
<v Speaker 8>think of it actually is an insurance</v>

122
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 8>policy where you're buying this really</v>
<v Speaker 8>ever more expensive insurance so that</v>

123
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.120
<v Speaker 8>the students don't fall through the</v>
<v Speaker 8>really big cracks in our society.</v>

124
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 8>And we should be asking some big</v>
<v Speaker 8>questions why the insurance costs are</v>

125
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 8>going up and up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And if you were the president of Harvard</v>

126
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 8>or Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you want it to get,</v>

127
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a lynch mob of students,</v>

128
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 8>alumni,</v>
<v Speaker 8>faculty to come after you and try to</v>

129
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 8>lynch you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what you should say is something like</v>

130
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.660
<v Speaker 8>this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

131
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 8>we,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we live in this much larger,</v>

132
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 8>more global world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We offer a great education to everybody</v>

133
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 8>and so we're going to double or triple</v>
<v Speaker 8>our enrollment over the next 15 to 20</v>

134
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 8>years.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And people would,</v>

135
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.440
<v Speaker 8>they'd all be furious because the value</v>
<v Speaker 8>of the degrees comes from this massive</v>

136
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 8>exclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

137
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and what you're really running is</v>

138
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 8>something like a studio 54 nightclub.</v>

139
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 9>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I hated school.</v>

140
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.660
<v Speaker 9>I hated school.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I hated school generally,</v>

141
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.720
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because it was this instruction</v>

142
00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:20.080
<v Speaker 9>following thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Now I bet you it's probably also because</v>

143
00:07:20.081 --> 00:07:22.720
<v Speaker 9>I wasn't good at it and some people are</v>
<v Speaker 9>like,</v>

144
00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:26.860
<v Speaker 9>I've got a great conceptual memory and a</v>
<v Speaker 9>terrible rote memory.</v>

145
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.550
<v Speaker 9>So if I have a story I could tell you</v>
<v Speaker 9>year by year kind of what happened,</v>

146
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.250
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>within a story,</v>

147
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.150
<v Speaker 9>within a context a.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But if I was to go into,</v>

148
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.310
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like a memory based learning,</v>

149
00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:44.620
<v Speaker 9>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I have a terrible rote memory.</v>

150
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:50.250
<v Speaker 9>Ego Barrier is the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And if we were raised differently,</v>

151
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.150
<v Speaker 9>just imagine in the schools at all along</v>
<v Speaker 9>that people will always say everybody</v>

152
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:58.270
<v Speaker 9>makes mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Everybody has weaknesses.</v>

153
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 9>The key is really to understand what</v>
<v Speaker 9>your mistakes and weaknesses are so that</v>

154
00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:05.620
<v Speaker 9>you can learn from them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

155
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.100
<v Speaker 9>I think punishment is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is it is a terrible concept.</v>

156
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.210
<v Speaker 9>Punishment means that you made a mistake</v>
<v Speaker 9>and you're being punished.</v>

157
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 9>I think instead of punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 9>every time somebody makes a mistake,</v>

158
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.550
<v Speaker 9>you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the only thing that you need to do to</v>

159
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.230
<v Speaker 9>get out of your punishment is first</v>
<v Speaker 9>think what kind of mistake was that?</v>

160
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.650
<v Speaker 9>So if I'm in this situation that's like</v>
<v Speaker 9>that again,</v>

161
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.470
<v Speaker 9>how would I do deal with it differently</v>
<v Speaker 9>not to make that mistake?</v>

162
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.730
<v Speaker 9>So that learning should come from the</v>
<v Speaker 9>mistake,</v>

163
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.390
<v Speaker 9>not punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 9>because you're teaching people not to</v>

164
00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:45.090
<v Speaker 9>make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We're,</v>

165
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.100
<v Speaker 9>whereas where the learning comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not the appreciation that if you keep</v>

166
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:54.100
<v Speaker 9>doing this over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're going to keep encountering the</v>

167
00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:55.030
<v Speaker 9>same outcomes.</v>

168
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.200
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's an extremely,</v>

169
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.290
<v Speaker 8>a corrupt system.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We have at this point,</v>

170
00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:02.770
<v Speaker 8>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we have an education bubble in the US.</v>

171
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:07.040
<v Speaker 8>We have a trillion dollars of student</v>
<v Speaker 8>debt to a first approximation.</v>

172
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:11.120
<v Speaker 8>This has gone to pay for a trillion</v>
<v Speaker 8>dollars worth of lies about the value of</v>

173
00:09:11.121 --> 00:09:13.430
<v Speaker 8>the education people have received.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

174
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.650
<v Speaker 8>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I,</v>

175
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.890
<v Speaker 8>it's not at all obvious yet though,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's going to,</v>

176
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.700
<v Speaker 8>what's going to replace this or how it's</v>
<v Speaker 8>going to change.</v>

177
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.350
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my um,</v>

178
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.560
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

179
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.380
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

180
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.213
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

181
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.970
<v Speaker 8>and I'm somewhat skeptical that it will</v>
<v Speaker 8>be replaced by any sort of single</v>

182
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.950
<v Speaker 8>unitary system and I have this</v>
<v Speaker 8>fellowship for a young people to start</v>

183
00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:40.850
<v Speaker 8>companies and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my claim is not that everybody should do</v>

184
00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:41.930
<v Speaker 8>this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think everyone should become an</v>

185
00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:42.651
<v Speaker 8>entrepreneur.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I think,</v>

186
00:09:42.651 --> 00:09:45.020
<v Speaker 8>I think there is no one size fits all.</v>

187
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.360
<v Speaker 8>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think the future will be much more</v>

188
00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:50.000
<v Speaker 8>heterogeneous,</v>
<v Speaker 8>much more diverse in terms of what</v>

189
00:09:50.001 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 8>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

190
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.341
<v Speaker 8>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what's,</v>

191
00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:55.640
<v Speaker 8>what's really anomalous is the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 8>unitary tracking where you have to go to</v>

192
00:09:55.641 --> 00:09:58.430
<v Speaker 8>an elite college,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you go to Yale or you go to jail,</v>

193
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.990
<v Speaker 8>there's nothing else you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know.</v>

194
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.880
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and so the,</v>

195
00:10:01.881 --> 00:10:02.191
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

196
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:07.191
<v Speaker 8>I think the universities are perhaps in</v>
<v Speaker 8>perhaps in the same place as the</v>

197
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.500
<v Speaker 8>Catholic Church was in 1,514.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If we go back 500 years where,</v>

198
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:15.200
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have sort of a monolithic way,</v>

199
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.030
<v Speaker 8>you this universal way of a body of</v>
<v Speaker 8>knowledge of teaching things.</v>

200
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.560
<v Speaker 8>The difference between the Yale and the</v>
<v Speaker 8>Harvard political science faculties are</v>

201
00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:27.830
<v Speaker 8>probably no greater than the differences</v>
<v Speaker 8>between the Dominicans and the</v>

202
00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:30.770
<v Speaker 8>Franciscans.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We've all kinds of small debates within</v>

203
00:10:30.771 --> 00:10:32.690
<v Speaker 8>this context.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

204
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.680
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we are,</v>

205
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.480
<v Speaker 8>we have a system of indulgences that's</v>
<v Speaker 8>costing more and more to support this</v>

206
00:10:38.481 --> 00:10:41.060
<v Speaker 8>priestly or professorial class of</v>
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>

207
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.620
<v Speaker 8>We are told that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

208
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.120
<v Speaker 8>it's the only way to salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You must get a diploma to be saved.</v>

209
00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:49.310
<v Speaker 8>If you do not get a diploma,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then you will go to hell.</v>

210
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.590
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I think,</v>

211
00:10:51.591 --> 00:10:52.790
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I think the,</v>

212
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:54.010
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think the,</v>

213
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.410
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the message that I have that's like the</v>

214
00:10:57.411 --> 00:11:01.820
<v Speaker 8>16th century reformers,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's a somewhat troubling message is</v>

215
00:11:01.821 --> 00:11:04.670
<v Speaker 8>that you have to work out your salvation</v>
<v Speaker 8>on your own.</v>

216
00:11:04.671 --> 00:11:06.170
<v Speaker 8>You have to save yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>

217
00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:06.861
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

218
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:07.694
<v Speaker 8>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's,</v>

219
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.960
<v Speaker 8>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I believe that is the truth.</v>

220
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 8>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

221
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:11.600
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's somewhat uncomfortable with.</v>
