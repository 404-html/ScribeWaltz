1
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Speaker 1>All results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reasons don't count.</v>

2
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Parks will always point out reasons on</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they are not living their dream on</v>

3
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>why they are not manifesting their</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatness.</v>

4
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>They will always be able to point those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things out,</v>

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 1>but none of those things count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that counts or results</v>

6
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>and results don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

7
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>they tell it all judge a tree by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit that it bears,</v>

8
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.650
<v Speaker 1>not the ones that it might talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the ones that it might wish for,</v>

9
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 1>but the fruit that it actually bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are committed are busy</v>

10
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:51.350
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that some of us are</v>

11
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>producing results in our lives that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of commitment brains that we</v>

12
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>particularly don't like or find is</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasteful.</v>

13
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>You want to take care of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that as a participant in</v>

14
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:07.070
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot be committed.</v>

15
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>You either committed to mediocrity or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're committed to greatness.</v>

16
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>You're either committed to being</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive or you're committed to being</v>

17
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>nonproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You committed to being happy,</v>

18
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:20.901
<v Speaker 1>or you're committed to being unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I look at how you commit your time</v>

19
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.760
<v Speaker 1>one time doing an evaluation on how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend your time.</v>

20
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you exactly what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to.</v>

21
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>People that say they have dreams or one</v>
<v Speaker 1>open a business or want to do something</v>

22
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>differently than what they're now doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like their jobs.</v>

23
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>They're unhappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're unfulfilled.</v>

24
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>People said they want to improve their</v>
<v Speaker 1>income level.</v>

25
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Look at how they spend their time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commitment shows up in your life and</v>

26
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:46.094
<v Speaker 1>what you do.</v>

27
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.160
<v Speaker 3>you can make the commitment to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

29
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 3>but you don't like the results that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have and that you're going to do</v>

30
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 3>something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

31
00:01:56.481 --> 00:02:01.481
<v Speaker 3>that power is available to all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who look at life and decide,</v>

32
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.580
<v Speaker 3>I want something different for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most people like them using the</v>

33
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to commit themselves</v>

34
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 3>because commitment means among many</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

35
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's stills is acceptable.</v>

36
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.400
<v Speaker 3>You decided that you want to Jill this</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it becomes pop and then do it if it</v>

37
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:27.880
<v Speaker 3>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's inconvenient.</v>

38
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.760
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would your life be like if you</v>

39
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 3>decided to keep your commitments?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we'll all have our lives be like if</v>

40
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 3>we decided to keep our commitments that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we decided to do the things that we said</v>

41
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 3>that we were going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we wouldn't even speak it unless we</v>

42
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 3>were going to do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

43
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 3>I will do anything unless I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

44
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the seven days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll feel strong and powerful.</v>

45
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.480
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing as powerful as the human</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual,</v>

46
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 3>Qantas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

47
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 3>When you are committed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dancing to the beat of a</v>

48
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 3>different drummer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't expect people to understand.</v>

49
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 3>Don't expect it to make sense to</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>

50
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Why you got to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have got to go?</v>

51
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 3>Why did you leave this as a good job?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take you away</v>

52
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 3>from retirement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>

53
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>

54
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to</v>

55
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>look to this day for it is life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very life of light in its brief</v>

56
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>costs lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the realities and their of</v>

57
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bliss of growth,</v>

58
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>the splendor of action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the glory of power for yesterday is but</v>

59
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And tomorrow is only a vision.</v>

60
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>But today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day well lived makes every yesterday</v>

61
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>a dream of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every tomorrow a vision of hope.</v>

62
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Look well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore to this day.</v>
