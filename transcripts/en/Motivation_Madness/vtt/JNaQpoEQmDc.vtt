<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>

2
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>This is a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the 20th century starts to wind down</v>

3
00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>a few more years as we get ready for</v>
<v Speaker 1>century 21,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What a good time to get it together?</v>

6
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>What a good time to start this process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal development,</v>

7
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.090
<v Speaker 1>growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing,</v>

8
00:00:40.091 --> 00:00:43.510
<v Speaker 1>developing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a good plan for your money and</v>

9
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 1>for your life and for your future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not was</v>

10
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.540
<v Speaker 2>no opportunity is wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to me carefully.</v>

11
00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:58.240
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do me very carefully.</v>

12
00:00:58.241 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 2>You got to hear what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is important.</v>

13
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 2>They're 86,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 seconds in a day and if you maximize</v>

14
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 2>each and every one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will live like you want to live.</v>

15
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:11.630
<v Speaker 2>You will have what you want to have and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be what you want to be.</v>

16
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>You can have more than you've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can become more than you</v>

17
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just remain how you are,</v>

18
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>you'll always have what you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're willing to make changes,</v>

19
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>the next five years of your life can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different than the last one.</v>

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>If you don't change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chances are excellent.</v>

21
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>The next five will be like the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>

22
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>For things to change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to change for things to get</v>

23
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what happens that determines</v>

24
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>your future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you do about what happens.</v>

25
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Direction determines destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you got to do is make a little</v>

26
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>change in direction to arrive at a brand</v>
<v Speaker 1>new destination in two years,</v>

27
00:01:58.381 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years,</v>

28
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.640
<v Speaker 2>user have to change your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

29
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 2>She kind of said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

30
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 2>My body is on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go work out.</v>

31
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 2>My relationship isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to change it.</v>

32
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making what are going to make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to retool.</v>

33
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get a new skill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go back to school.</v>

34
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start a business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do something.</v>

35
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.370
<v Speaker 2>You have to do something to change your</v>
<v Speaker 2>life or in order for you to be happy.</v>

36
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 2>You can't change your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to change your</v>

37
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 2>blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually in life.</v>

38
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 2>It requires a little bit of beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

39
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 2>And if you've changed your take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change your life and change your</v>

40
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 2>blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have an extraordinary life</v>

41
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 2>because all of us are going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>times in our life when we want or think</v>

42
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 2>life should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't gonna match how life really is?</v>

43
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Those moments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we blame our life goes into pain.</v>

44
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 2>If we change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can change our life and match our</v>

45
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:54.561
<v Speaker 2>blueprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you're not happy has</v>

46
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with what you have or</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have.</v>

47
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you're an unhappy is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life doesn't match the way you</v>

48
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 2>think it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have some idea of how you think it</v>

49
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:04.774
<v Speaker 2>should be.</v>

50
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>

51
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Those of you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're doing is that they're are 10</v>

52
00:03:09.451 --> 00:03:11.850
<v Speaker 2>opportunities in a day and you're taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage of it.</v>

53
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.020
<v Speaker 2>If you think you're doing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

54
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta hear me,</v>

55
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 2>you gotta hear me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only have 24 hours in a day,</v>

56
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 2>and you've heard me say this time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>time again,</v>

57
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.300
<v Speaker 2>the way you spend your 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it determines how you live.</v>

58
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>If you want the future to change for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

59
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>you've got to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't change,</v>

60
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>the next six years of your life is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be just like the last six.</v>

61
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>You'll still be behind on your bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll still be behind on your promises.</v>

62
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.130
<v Speaker 2>No opportunity wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

63
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.830
<v Speaker 2>no opportunity wasted.</v>

64
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.900
<v Speaker 1>If one of us can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

65
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:54.630
<v Speaker 1>we all can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

66
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:57.090
<v Speaker 1>here's my last question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

67
00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:57.924
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

68
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 3>we all have this negative self talk that</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes in our head.</v>

69
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's enough people that are telling</v>

70
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 3>us we can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're not good enough.</v>

71
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Why do we want to tell ourselves that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>know for fact that thoughts influence</v>

72
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 3>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We sat there with the,</v>

73
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the video sheldon,</v>

74
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:22.970
<v Speaker 3>Dr Levy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so right.</v>

75
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 3>We know that our thoughts influence</v>
<v Speaker 3>actions.</v>

76
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 3>Why do we want to see that negative self</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to ourselves?</v>

77
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 3>We need to get our own self-affirmation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muhammad Ali,</v>

78
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 3>what was his self affirmation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am the greatest.</v>

79
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Who else is going to tell you you need</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be quiet moments in your bedroom,</v>

80
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Speaker 3>quiet moments when you're brushing your</v>
<v Speaker 3>teeth that we need to reaffirm,</v>

81
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.970
<v Speaker 3>I am the captain of my ship and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>master of my fate.</v>

82
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 3>That is my affirmation and looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward to a time that I would feel good</v>

83
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helped me to keep moving forward and</v>

84
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I had to be brave and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't always easy.</v>

85
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I faltered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had bad days,</v>

86
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 3>but I realized that being brave is</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be easy.</v>

87
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel it's the key way to keep moving</v>

88
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all at all,</v>

89
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't waste energy feeling bad for</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

90
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I surround myself with people that I</v>

91
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 3>want to be with and I keep moving</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>

92
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 3>So with this philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope that all of you,</v>

93
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.940
<v Speaker 3>regardless of your obstacles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can have a very happy life as well.</v>

94
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't see it,</v>

95
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 3>if I don't believe you that no one else</v>
<v Speaker 3>will</v>

96
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.620
<v Speaker 3>get the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's enough of that Mohammed Ali.</v>

97
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.380
<v Speaker 3>I am the greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no one better than me.</v>

98
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 3>It's a difference between Hubris and ego</v>
<v Speaker 3>and false pride.</v>

99
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 4>It's just reminding yourself and quiet</v>
<v Speaker 4>silent moments.</v>

100
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 4>I put it down on the list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right beside my mirror</v>

101
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.970
<v Speaker 5>in Russia</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Japan ever met in,</v>

102
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.280
<v Speaker 5>made in America the whole world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but better than all of those before.</v>

103
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

104
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 6>I'm not gonna argue with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to be just like some of</v>

105
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.350
<v Speaker 6>your already there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

106
00:06:55.351 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 6>you don't know how you're going to make</v>
<v Speaker 6>this happen,</v>

107
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 6>but you just feel within yourself some</v>
<v Speaker 6>way somehow with the help of God,</v>

108
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.680
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Repeat after me please.</v>

109
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.910
<v Speaker 6>No matter how bad it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

110
00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:16.911
<v Speaker 6>how bad it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to make it.</v>

111
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to make it</v>
<v Speaker 6>shake someone's hand on your right and</v>

112
00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:28.891
<v Speaker 6>left and say you got the right stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yes,</v>

113
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.570
<v Speaker 6>it's possible for you to live your dream</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's not about where you come</v>

114
00:07:49.351 --> 00:07:50.590
<v Speaker 6>from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's about.</v>

115
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.850
<v Speaker 6>That's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Number two.</v>

116

<v Speaker 8>I want you to remember this.</v>

140
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.620
<v Speaker 8>Every time you walk in the room</v>
<v Speaker 8>with anybody,</v>

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.623
<v Speaker 8>anybody,</v>

143
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.073
<v Speaker 8>world.</v>

144
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:08.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't care what you started at.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't care who told you what you</v>

145
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.360
<v Speaker 6>couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe</v>

146
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't care if nobody liked your</v>
<v Speaker 6>status,</v>

147
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:29.510
<v Speaker 6>family members turning back on</v>
<v Speaker 6>negative.</v>

148
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.560
<v Speaker 6>People want to keep coming to your life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a bigger dream waiting for you,</v>

149
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.260
<v Speaker 6>waiting</v>
<v Speaker 6>for you to step into it,</v>

150
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.320
<v Speaker 6>a bit to it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to step into it.</v>

151
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.300
<v Speaker 6>Your life is big.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your life is huge,</v>

152
00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 6>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we spend so much time wanting to be</v>

153
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.200
<v Speaker 6>in somebody else's life.</v>

154
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.710
<v Speaker 9>When I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I had a lot of people telling me,</v>

155
00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:21.230
<v Speaker 9>you have to adjust to the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the other ones,</v>

156
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.750
<v Speaker 9>you have to be like the other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was listening,</v>

157
00:11:26.751 --> 00:11:31.210
<v Speaker 9>but I wasn't always following.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I dragged it in.</v>

158
00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:33.420
<v Speaker 9>How do you say I was listening,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I did my own thing,</v>

159
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.210
<v Speaker 9>my own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I kept doing my own thing and I believed</v>

160
00:11:37.211 --> 00:11:41.500
<v Speaker 9>in myself.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I kept going and it brought me where I</v>

161
00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:45.970
<v Speaker 9>am today.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Confidence in believing what you do.</v>

162
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.810
<v Speaker 6>I think that is the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Target</v>

163
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.800
<v Speaker 8>have to be relentless.</v>

164
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 6>You have to never let off the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gas,</v>

165
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.990
<v Speaker 6>never stop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>never quit.</v>

166
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 6>Never allow anyone to talk you out</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the dream division and ideas that God</v>

167
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:10.710
<v Speaker 6>has sent you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter how many times you get</v>

168
00:12:10.711 --> 00:12:12.420
<v Speaker 6>knocked down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's about getting back up,</v>

169
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:17.400
<v Speaker 6>so if there's any kid out there that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>told by a parent or a coach or a teacher</v>

170
00:12:17.401 --> 00:12:20.250
<v Speaker 6>or somebody that they look up to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody that's supposed to push them</v>

171
00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:21.870
<v Speaker 6>and believe in them and they're told,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

172
00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:25.860
<v Speaker 6>don't listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Believe in yourself.</v>

173
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.620
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes the outcome isn't always what</v>
<v Speaker 6>you desire it to be,</v>

174
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.530
<v Speaker 6>but the true failure in life is not</v>
<v Speaker 6>trying at all</v>

175
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.900
<v Speaker 6>and the master</v>
<v Speaker 6>no</v>

176
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.670
<v Speaker 10>get in line just because other people</v>
<v Speaker 10>are.</v>

177
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.970
<v Speaker 10>I'm only talking to the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 10>ready to get to the next level of a life</v>

178
00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:03.971
<v Speaker 10>in their career and they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 10>boldly walk into the next season of</v>

179
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 10>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Unapologetically getting rid of all</v>

180
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:12.460
<v Speaker 10>things people in situations that no</v>
<v Speaker 10>longer belong in their life.</v>

181
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.860
<v Speaker 10>Most of you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>most of you,</v>

182
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.970
<v Speaker 10>you're so consumed</v>
<v Speaker 10>with everything that's going on in the</v>

183
00:13:26.971 --> 00:13:30.330
<v Speaker 10>world.</v>
<v Speaker 10>This is the reason you haven't figured</v>

184
00:13:30.331 --> 00:13:35.310
<v Speaker 10>out your own life yet.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Every blog,</v>

185
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.110
<v Speaker 10>every website,</v>
<v Speaker 10>every tweet,</v>

186
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:42.230
<v Speaker 10>every instagram post,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you are so consumed with everything</v>

187
00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:48.450
<v Speaker 10>that's going on in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You're ignoring your own world.</v>

188
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 10>You can never shine trying to sit on</v>
<v Speaker 10>someone else's son.</v>

189
00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:00.470
<v Speaker 10>You can never figure out who you are if</v>
<v Speaker 10>you're consumed in everything that</v>

190
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:04.980
<v Speaker 10>everybody else is and what they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 10>in the moves that they're making because</v>

191
00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:09.360
<v Speaker 10>you're trying to chase someone else's</v>
<v Speaker 10>life trying to chase someone else's</v>

192
00:14:09.361 --> 00:14:14.270
<v Speaker 10>lifestyle and identity all while</v>
<v Speaker 10>ignoring your own life and your own</v>

193
00:14:14.271 --> 00:14:17.090
<v Speaker 10>path.</v>
<v Speaker 10>What is the vision for your life?</v>

194
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.540
<v Speaker 10>What are the ideas and the dreams for</v>
<v Speaker 10>your life?</v>

195
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.690
<v Speaker 10>What are you supposed to be doing?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Who are you?</v>

196
00:14:23.691 --> 00:14:28.100
<v Speaker 10>What are your gifts and talents?</v>
<v Speaker 10>What is your ultimate destiny and your</v>

197
00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:28.934
<v Speaker 10>goals</v>

198
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.800
<v Speaker 10>and you should understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that it was always going to be your</v>

199
00:14:33.801 --> 00:14:37.880
<v Speaker 10>family and your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That would be the first ones to try and</v>

200
00:14:37.881 --> 00:14:40.130
<v Speaker 10>talk you out of your vision and your big</v>
<v Speaker 10>idea.</v>

201
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.250
<v Speaker 10>That's why you supposed to live your</v>
<v Speaker 10>life,</v>

202
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.730
<v Speaker 10>focused on your intentions and do your</v>
<v Speaker 10>thing.</v>

203
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 5>Did you allow yourself</v>

204
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.550
<v Speaker 10>to be based on what other people think</v>
<v Speaker 10>of you?</v>

205
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.980
<v Speaker 10>Is the beginning of the end,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I believe in me.</v>

206
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.890
<v Speaker 10>If you stopped believing in me,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm not going to believe in myself any</v>

207
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 10>less.</v>
<v Speaker 10>If you believe that I'm irrelevant,</v>

208
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 10>that no one is checking for me and that</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't mean anything to the world</v>

209
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.600
<v Speaker 10>because you think or believe that about</v>
<v Speaker 10>me,</v>

210
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.480
<v Speaker 10>it doesn't mean that I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 10>believe it about myself.</v>

211
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.770
<v Speaker 10>See,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the day that you start living your life</v>

212
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.780
<v Speaker 10>according to everybody else's opinion is</v>
<v Speaker 10>the beginning of the hand.</v>

213
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.510
<v Speaker 10>Most of you guys don't actually know</v>
<v Speaker 10>your self worth.</v>

214
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.240
<v Speaker 10>You don't know yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Value,</v>

215
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.610
<v Speaker 10>believe in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Believe in yourself,</v>

216
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.860
<v Speaker 10>independent of the validation of the</v>
<v Speaker 10>world.</v>

217
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.580
<v Speaker 10>I have opinions and feelings about</v>
<v Speaker 10>yourself,</v>

218
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.260
<v Speaker 10>independent of the feedback.</v>

219
00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.620
<v Speaker 5>I really think,</v>

220
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 10>and if you get rid of the trash in your</v>
<v Speaker 10>life,</v>

221
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.120
<v Speaker 10>that can be people,</v>
<v Speaker 10>business and situations.</v>

222
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:14.050
<v Speaker 10>Youtube couldn't really like.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I really believe that you can reach your</v>

223
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:16.910
<v Speaker 10>full potential.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I want you</v>

224
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.800
<v Speaker 10>to fly.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I want you in your career and your</v>

225
00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:25.490
<v Speaker 10>financial blessings to bypass me.</v>

226
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.610
<v Speaker 5>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can go through,</v>

227
00:16:41.611 --> 00:16:43.150
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a math book in a week.</v>

228
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:48.151
<v Speaker 5>So I'm going to have chocolate Ganache,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stockbroker,</v>

229
00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:01.360
<v Speaker 5>stop focusing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not an astronaut,</v>

230
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.200
<v Speaker 6>but I listened to what Jim Bob on will</v>
<v Speaker 6>say at 21 years,</v>

231
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:21.940
<v Speaker 6>the most poignant seven words ever</v>
<v Speaker 6>uttered in any speech anywhere.</v>

232
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.300
<v Speaker 6>Don't give up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't ever give up.</v>

233
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:32.790
<v Speaker 6>Those great people didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I now have a responsibility to also</v>

234
00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:39.130
<v Speaker 6>not ever give up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not special.</v>

235
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.350
<v Speaker 6>I just listened to what the man said,</v>

236
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.800
<v Speaker 6>but I'd say there is some times in life</v>
<v Speaker 6>where you fall down,</v>

237
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 6>feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you don't have the strength to get</v>

238
00:17:50.191 --> 00:17:55.191
<v Speaker 6>back on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will try 100 times to get up and if I</v>

239
00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:01.980
<v Speaker 6>fail 100 times,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I fail and I give up,</v>

240
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 6>do you think that I'm ever going to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>up</v>

241
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.760
<v Speaker 6>and fail and try again and again and</v>
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>

242
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:14.150
<v Speaker 6>For as long as I'm trying to getting up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't quit.</v>

243
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.340
<v Speaker 6>The secret is not keeping up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody who's done something great,</v>

244
00:18:19.341 --> 00:18:24.341
<v Speaker 6>they weren't that deep resiliency.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have the ability to bounce back all</v>

245
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.260
<v Speaker 6>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just</v>

246
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.100
<v Speaker 6>stay on course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guarantee you cannot pass it.</v>

247
00:18:34.101 --> 00:18:35.800
<v Speaker 6>If you quit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guarantee you,</v>

248
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.310
<v Speaker 6>you don't know what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you keep going,</v>

249
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.300
<v Speaker 6>I'm prejudiced,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel pain.</v>

250
00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.490
<v Speaker 6>I heard I opened my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A great victory.</v>

251
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.470
<v Speaker 6>Do not give up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel no fear.</v>

252
00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.640
<v Speaker 6>I fear no man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I create.</v>

253
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 6>Conquer that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hold the power.</v>

254
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:10.470
<v Speaker 6>Make a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just decide what is going to be,</v>

255
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.840
<v Speaker 6>who you're going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how you're going to do it.</v>

256
00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:17.841
<v Speaker 6>Just decide and then from that point the</v>
<v Speaker 6>universe is going to get out your way.</v>

257
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:24.120
<v Speaker 6>We can have another bad year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to get to the point where enough</v>

258
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:29.420
<v Speaker 6>is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's much easier to come up with excuses</v>

259
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.320
<v Speaker 6>why you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you do what is easy,</v>

260
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:40.040
<v Speaker 6>your life will be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you do want to say is complain about</v>

261
00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:44.220
<v Speaker 6>your situation and circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 6>surrender and give up on your dreams.</v>

262
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.450
<v Speaker 6>Become depressed and bitter and angry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anybody can do that.</v>

263
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:51.210
<v Speaker 6>If you do what is easy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your life will be hard,</v>

264
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.850
<v Speaker 6>would have you do what is Paul?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Keep coming back again and again and</v>

265
00:19:56.851 --> 00:19:59.850
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Get up dressed every day.</v>

266
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:04.870
<v Speaker 6>Take life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>taking life by the column.</v>

267
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.540
<v Speaker 6>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

268
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:16.300
<v Speaker 6>I can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you've said to yourself,</v>

269
00:20:16.911 --> 00:20:20.000
<v Speaker 6>I'm willing to face the nose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm willing,</v>

270
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.300
<v Speaker 6>I'm willing to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm willing to make this happen.</v>

271
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.100
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's possible.</v>

272
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.920
<v Speaker 6>It's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard.</v>

273
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:37.550
<v Speaker 6>It's worth it to do whatever it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can do it.</v>

274
00:20:37.551 --> 00:20:41.500
<v Speaker 6>If anybody has ever done at any point in</v>
<v Speaker 6>time in history than what's possible for</v>

275
00:20:41.501 --> 00:20:44.360
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's possible for me and I'm going to</v>

276
00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 6>deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if you do that and over</v>

277
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.980
<v Speaker 3>and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life will be easy.</v>

278
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.840
<v Speaker 3>I want you to stop gathering information</v>
<v Speaker 3>from outside yourself.</v>

279
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Start gathering the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made a mistake</v>

280
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.250
<v Speaker 3>and he paid for his mistake with a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of pain,</v>

281
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:19.670
<v Speaker 3>a lot of tears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there came to a point where he knew</v>

282
00:21:19.671 --> 00:21:23.450
<v Speaker 3>he should've gotten a divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was stuck.</v>

283
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.720
<v Speaker 3>He was stuck in something called</v>
<v Speaker 3>revenge.</v>

284
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.450
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's made me so miserable.</v>

285
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pay Her back.</v>

286
00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.900
<v Speaker 3>He was stuck and he stayed in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer than he should have because it</v>

287
00:21:35.901 --> 00:21:37.760
<v Speaker 3>began to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Attack him.</v>

288
00:21:37.761 --> 00:21:39.980
<v Speaker 3>It began to affect them psychologically.</v>

289
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.080
<v Speaker 5>Mm.</v>

290
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.990
<v Speaker 3>He took that same attitude to other</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships.</v>

291
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Looking for something to go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was burned so badly,</v>

292
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.180
<v Speaker 3>he did not want to risk pain again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was going in relationships,</v>

293
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:05.020
<v Speaker 3>trying to avoid pain when it became too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he will do something to make sure</v>

294
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:08.290
<v Speaker 3>the relationship did not work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would always try and find something</v>

295
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:08.780
<v Speaker 3>wrong with it.</v>

296
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.880
<v Speaker 2>The person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're not perfect people,</v>

297
00:22:10.881 --> 00:22:12.530
<v Speaker 2>so if you look forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find it.</v>

298
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.280
<v Speaker 2>He was stuck in revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it difficult?</v>

299
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Sure isn't anything that's worthy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>character building.</v>

300
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I have to forgive the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>people over and over and over again.</v>

301
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.710
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgiveness is a practice worth</v>

302
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.140
<v Speaker 2>cultivating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worth experiencing.</v>

303
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.040
<v Speaker 2>When you forgive somebody for something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you perceived that they've done</v>

304
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 2>wrong to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are releasing that animosity,</v>

305
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 2>that energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ill will,</v>

306
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.180
<v Speaker 2>that you're harboring inside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a lot more difficult than just</v>

307
00:22:46.181 --> 00:22:48.310
<v Speaker 2>merely saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

308
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.070
<v Speaker 2>how did I get depressed to who I am</v>
<v Speaker 2>today?</v>

309
00:22:56.071 --> 00:22:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Because I tell you I was depressed when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was age eight.</v>

310
00:22:59.791 --> 00:23:02.040
<v Speaker 2>I used to concentrate on the things I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have.</v>

311
00:23:02.041 --> 00:23:03.900
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legs and I wish I could do this,</v>

312
00:23:03.901 --> 00:23:05.430
<v Speaker 2>but what can I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see?</v>

313
00:23:05.431 --> 00:23:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I have a choice and that's what I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about today.</v>

314
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Choices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can either be angry for not having</v>

315
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:13.110
<v Speaker 2>arms and legs will be thankful for my</v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken.</v>

316
00:23:13.111 --> 00:23:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Drumstick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

317
00:23:15.901 --> 00:23:18.510
<v Speaker 2>I can still do a lot of things at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can brush my teeth,</v>

318
00:23:18.511 --> 00:23:20.550
<v Speaker 2>comb my hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get myself ready in the morning.</v>

319
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm traveling around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

320
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.180
<v Speaker 11>It's a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That is what I want to live.</v>

321
00:23:28.181 --> 00:23:31.450
<v Speaker 11>My life can't always be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Listen,</v>

322
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:36.510
<v Speaker 11>I know I'm not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I realized the realism in always been</v>

323
00:23:36.911 --> 00:23:38.760
<v Speaker 11>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Sometimes you have to put up with crap</v>

324
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.670
<v Speaker 11>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but if we're always striving to choose</v>

325
00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:45.350
<v Speaker 11>happiness everyday you wake up and you</v>
<v Speaker 11>say to yourself,</v>

326
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.650
<v Speaker 11>I'm going to choose to not let the</v>
<v Speaker 11>outside influences in the world affect</v>

327
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.950
<v Speaker 11>my mood.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'm going to be in charge of how I feel</v>

328
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.310
<v Speaker 11>because I am a choose happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I promise you,</v>

329
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 11>you will leave a lot happier life.</v>
<v Speaker 11>At least.</v>

330
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.730
<v Speaker 11>At least you can try to write.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You just have to set the necessary</v>

331
00:24:04.731 --> 00:24:09.320
<v Speaker 11>conditions for health necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 11>incentives for health,</v>

332
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 11>both for yourself and your children.</v>
<v Speaker 11>If you have that set incentives for</v>

333
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:15.584
<v Speaker 11>sickness,</v>

334
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.170
<v Speaker 11>I felt depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I felt miserable.</v>

335
00:24:22.171 --> 00:24:25.860
<v Speaker 11>I felt at times where it may be better</v>
<v Speaker 11>to take my life,</v>

336
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.950
<v Speaker 11>but with the wisdom that I gathered in</v>
<v Speaker 11>my 33 short years of life,</v>

337
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:37.220
<v Speaker 11>I've come to realize that it's just</v>
<v Speaker 11>feeling and in the same way that</v>

338
00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:44.420
<v Speaker 11>chameleon cold is diminished.</v>
<v Speaker 11>The misery of feeling cold is diminished</v>

339
00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:49.770
<v Speaker 11>by the insight that spring will come is</v>
<v Speaker 11>the same feeling that you should</v>

340
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.720
<v Speaker 11>acknowledge the same law,</v>
<v Speaker 11>that you should have knowledge that no</v>

341
00:24:54.721 --> 00:24:57.690
<v Speaker 11>matter how miserable things are right</v>
<v Speaker 11>now,</v>

342
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.760
<v Speaker 11>it is just a season.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's going to pass the thing that keeps</v>

343
00:25:02.761 --> 00:25:05.520
<v Speaker 11>one living,</v>
<v Speaker 11>his sense of future,</v>

344
00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.860
<v Speaker 11>that there will be a tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 11>tomorrow to do this,</v>

345
00:25:07.861 --> 00:25:11.340
<v Speaker 11>and then the day after I got to do that.</v>
